            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. Residential areas and businesses are near each other. Some areas are for offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment. There are many new restaurants and stores to eat and shop at. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are also popular. They are in malls and on the streets. People walk to these stores. There are parks near my neighborhood. I see people with their young children in these parks.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of people. One area has a community of LGBTQ+ people, Orthodox Jews, and people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people of different races and backgrounds. They have their own communities in the city. We have Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are a short drive away. But traffic in my city is very bad. It takes a long time to drive a short distance, especially during rush hour. Almost no one walks in my city. We have a lot of traffic and hard-to-find parking spots.\n\nThe city is getting bigger. New apartment buildings are being built. Many people are moving to the city. Some residents do not want more people and traffic. There are many kinds of houses in my city. Not everyone lives in big apartment buildings. We have houses of different sizes and smaller buildings. Some homes are for one family, and others are for two families. My neighborhood is also made up of people of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. My neighborhood is not close like it used to be. I have good memories of playing with my friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses have been split into two. They are still connected. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway to the side. My neighborhood looks like it did a long time ago. People wanted to live in the suburbs then. It seemed like a good life. But now it is not the same. Many people still live here. They still like it. The people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not as nice as they used to be. But there are still cars in the driveways. The kids still play. They think the world is their whole world. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still stands. It makes the young people think about the future. It makes the older people remember the past. There are few churches. They are not very full. The basketball courts are always full. All the houses are different. But they feel the same. There is a big store called \"A\". It is owned by a big Yemeni family. They may be the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people are African American. The streets are wide. The kids usually play football. They stop to let cars pass. Most people have lived here for many years. They can tell stories about when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school. But now it is a pharmacy. Kids do not want to be like Daniel-san anymore. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a lower price. The young people do not like it. They think it is old-fashioned. The older people like it. They think it is a good way to spend the night out. There is one highway that goes through our town. The entrance and exit are in the next town. People wanted to put an entrance and exit in our town. But the older people said no. They said it would make our town less nice. The city agreed with them. They are building a new school. We are choosing a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol for my town.",
            "You might not see it at first. This is a residential area behind a shopping strip. People do not usually live here. At least, not many people want to live here. But if you go behind the old shopping center and walk to the back, you will find a community. There are many apartment buildings here. They are close together like a line of boxes.\n\nThe first group of apartments has bad news. We will not talk about it much. It looks bad, but it is not all bad. The other apartment buildings are nice. Many people live here. Across from these buildings is a college. It is a small group of buildings. Students go there to learn. They are quiet and sleepy in the morning. They drink coffee and go to class.\n\nThe road goes through this area. It meets another road. On one side is a park. Children play here. They run around and play games. On the other side is a place to help people with broken bones. The porch is nice and there is a fan to cool the air.\n\nMany people live in this area. They walk their dogs and go to the park. Some teenagers ride skateboards and talk to their friends. There is a place to buy food, a store for swimming pools, and a place for people to get manicures. You can buy food, fill your pool, and get a manicure all at the same time. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Many teenagers like to eat frozen yogurt and ride their skateboards.\n\nThis is a special place. It is a part of American history. Nothing much changes here. Time goes slowly.",
            "We drove through a big area with many corn fields. \"What is this place?\" she asked. \"This is it,\" I said. She was from a city where a store was just a short walk from her house. She had never seen so much open space before. I told her about where I grew up in rural Ohio. She understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a small road. We passed a big hole in the ground with water in it. My home was just beyond that. My neighborhood has houses made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land. People take care of their land and are very proud of it. In the spring, we plant flowers and trees. The trees change color with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars, like Mercedes. They shine in the sun after a car wash.\n\nMy neighbor was outside. He was a doctor in his younger years. Now he is older and has a lawn mower. He mows his lawn all day and sings while he works. Everyone likes him. He is a kind person with a special story.\n\nWe finally arrived at my home. There are geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. Behind my house, there is a small stream that flows into the hole in the ground. You can hear frogs, water, and animals from the farms nearby. There is a bridge made of wood over the stream. On the other side, there are trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and played with my friends. We had snow in the winter. The trees were bare and looked like skeletons. Sometimes it snowed and our yard looked like a winter wonderland. My sister and I would make snowmen and snow angels. We would fight and use snowballs as our weapons. We built forts and had fun in the snow.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special place. Some say it is \"weird\". This is shown by the town slogan, \"Keep Portland Weird\". It is written on a building that has a pizza joint, a bar, a music place, and a place where people dance. People like this slogan. To some, it means keep the old Portland alive. This is the Portland from the 1990s and early 2000s. It was not as famous and not as expensive. It made new and creative cultures. To others, it means come to Portland, where people like being different.\n\nMany rich people from California have moved to Portland. New houses are being built. But Portland is still weird. Weird means accepting things that others do not accept. But it does not mean Portland does not have new things. We buy things from China like other parts of the country. There are many ways to be weird. But Portland also has normal things. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird means not taking things too seriously.\n\nI live in a neighborhood with colorful houses, gardens, and boxes. Boxes are free things people give away. They can be used boxes or plastic bags. Inside the boxes, you can find nice things, like clothes and books. You can find anything. This is what Portland is all about. Or at least, it is what Portland is all about to me. There are many kinds of weird people in Portland. Some people will never pick up things from a box. They will go to goat yoga or watch the soccer team, the Timbers.\n\nPortland is full of people who love many things. We have people who chase our dreams, or think about chasing our dreams while we drink too much at the bar. Portland has problems. We have a drug problem. It usually comes from mental health problems. The rain and clouds can make people feel sad. We also have a homelessness problem. Many people come here because we have good services. But our services are not enough. People who have homes are sometimes kind, sometimes angry. This is the same in other parts of the country. We are not weird in feeling this way.",
            "There are mountains in the north. They watch the sun every day. They see the sun come up and go down. They are always there. I forget about them sometimes. Work and life take my attention. But they are still there. They are strong and steady. They do not change. When I am very stressed, I think about them. They remind me to take a deep breath and to be strong. I moved here when I started college. The mountains near my school were beautiful. I loved them at first. The school has nice buildings and a pond. But the mountains are special to me. The town is nice too. There are many coffee shops where I studied. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and interesting. There are old buildings and restaurants. It is busy and exciting. But it is not busy for long. I can go back to a quiet part of town. The library is there. It is a place to rest. I like this town because it is different in different parts. It is a nice place to live. I have good memories here. I walked with friends in the park. We went to the movies in a nice theater. But I also have sad memories. We all have sad memories. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I went to the pond at night and wondered about my life. I looked at the animals and thought about my purpose. I walked to the main street and saw the sun. The sun was shining and made the sky beautiful. I looked at the mountains and I felt strong. They reminded me to be strong and to keep going.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will have no trouble finding it. The city has good public transportation. Bensonhurst is a busy neighborhood like the rest of New York City. You will see many Asian stores as you walk. Many Asian people live in Bensonhurst. This is why you will find an Asian store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are popular. People like these stores because food is good, prices are low, and they are easy to use.\n\nNear my home, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This is helpful for buying groceries. Bensonhurst is a mixed area. Many immigrants and their children live here. Some big businesses in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby. The park has many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, a playground for children, and a water fountain for kids to play in during the summer.\n\nThe area has many small homes and co-op buildings. Few big buildings are here. Many people are friendly, but some can be noisy. Cars often play music loudly as they drive by. You may hear a car starting quickly in the morning. At night, be careful. Some people can be mean. You may meet people who want to cause trouble. I was once bullied here. But that was a long time ago. Recently, someone took a package from my home. This is a common problem in Bensonhurst. People do not clean up after their dogs. Every day, you will see dog waste on the street. This is my biggest problem.",
            "I live in a place with few sidewalks. People have to walk on the road because there are no sidewalks. The road can be a little bit bad to drive on because it has holes in some places. There are many telephone and electric wires above the road. They look bad because they get broken in storms and need to be fixed many times.\n\nMy house is at the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work-out hill\" because many runners like to run up the hill. The houses are built high up so people can see the ocean.\n\nThere are many tall trees around my house. People do not like the trees because they block the view of the ocean. But the trees are nice when the sun sets. The water looks nice and the sky turns orange.\n\nIt often rains and storms in our area. Moss grows on everything, including houses, cars and railings. One time I left my car outside for a month and it got covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. The people are mostly older and many are retired. They have dogs instead of children. The dogs are always running around and sometimes they get into people's houses.\n\nWe have many wild rabbits. They dig up gardens and burrow into lawns. My cats like to catch them and there are not many rabbits left in our neighborhood.\n\nWe see many birds, like small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores in my neighborhood. But if you walk down to the waterfront, you can find some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not very big, but it is fun to throw rocks into the water.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street between two main roads. This means we have some traffic, but it is a quiet neighborhood. People do not move in and out often. I know most of my neighbors. They work in their yards and do other daily things. In the winter, we sled down a small hill. We live at the corner of the street. We see all the people who come and go. We take note of strangers' cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. We are at home a lot. We go outside and play, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck. It smells good. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. It is a wooded area, so we have trees and shade. We rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. We do not have much winter. It feels like a long fall. My garage is at the back of the house. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel close to my neighbors. On holidays, it is quiet. We have visitors on Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. I like living here. If the street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the middle of a dry and sandy area. This area is very different from many other places. When you look around, you see mostly brown and dirt. It is not very green like some other places. Sometimes I see a small green area, like a lawn. But this is very expensive to take care of. When I first moved here, there were many houses far apart. Now there are more houses, and it looks like a small city.\n\nPeople in my neighborhood are generally friendly. But, like any place, it has good and bad parts. Many old people live in my neighborhood, and it is a nice place. There are some stores, but not many. Most of the stores are part of big chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. My city is not very developed, and there are many open spaces. This is why many people work in construction. I work in construction, too. I install drywall and T-bars for a living.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the animals. People come to our area to see the beauty of the desert. The desert has a special climate and geography that supports many different kinds of wildlife. People who live here should learn about the animals that live here so we can live together safely. My family loves animals, and we have learned a lot about them. We even try to catch them when we can. If you come to visit, there are some things to see. Victorville is a good place for families to learn about the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair, which is a fun event. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, like rocks, old bones, and Native American artifacts.",
            "My neighborhood is the college campus where I live. I live in a dormitory with many people from different countries and ages. My neighborhood also includes the campus area around my dorm. I like my neighborhood. It has many things like homes, people, stores, and a park.\n\nLet's talk about the homes in my neighborhood. There are three kinds of homes. Some are apartments, some are houses, and some are dorm rooms. Apartments have 2-4 people in each room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Some buildings are 2 floors high. So, about 20 people live in each building. Some houses are for rent. They have 2-4 bedrooms. Only a few people live in these houses. Most students live in dorm rooms. Two people share a room, sometimes.\n\nMy college is proud of its diversity. People from many countries and ages live in my neighborhood. Some staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms and older students live in apartments. Let's talk about the stores and park. My school is a closed neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food, clothes, and things we need. We can buy anything we need in our neighborhood. The park is a fun place for everyone. It is clean and safe because all neighbors take care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I am happy to share what I know about it. When I first came here, I was sad. I missed my friends and family from Riverdale. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to Stockbridge. Our new neighborhood was better. It had good housing and a good high school. I made new friends and enemies in school. I did not get to know my neighbors very well, but I liked Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind people. I remember their wedding. My family and I attended. We had a good time. I even caught a white strap that Mrs. Glen took off her leg. I did not catch the flowers, though. I like to visit the park and walk in nature. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance with sticks. I have a wooden sword that I like to play with. There is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. We had fun, but we worked hard. I hope I can play again. I have had some happy times in this neighborhood. I think there is more to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. It is very convenient for me. Many apartment buildings are in my area. Some are old, but they have been renovated inside. There are also some restaurants and bars. They are fun to go to and not very expensive. One bar changed its name recently. It is a bit more expensive, but the service and drinks are good.\n\nMost people in my area are students or have low incomes. They live in apartments because they are not very expensive. There is an elementary school near my home. Many children live in the area. My neighbors are not very friendly. They smoke a lot. I do not want to know them.\n\nMy apartment building is old, but it has a lot of trees around it. Some trees were cut down, but there are still many trees. The street behind my building has another set of apartments. The street next to mine is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on that street to hide the bad buildings. Much crime happens on that street. But crime happens in other places too.\n\nI like where I live. I can afford it. There are many good things near my home. The college is close, and I can easily ride a bus to go shopping or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a circle street. They look like individual houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone is friends with each other. We stand at the end of our driveways sometimes and talk while our children play outside. It is nice to be in a place without many cars and computers. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies with white clouds. But we also have problems. This season, we have had tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the tornado sirens. We went to our shelter. I was in my bathtub with my small dog and a few things. My big dog stayed in the living room. It was quiet outside except for the sound of hail on the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road was hot. We had a big change in temperature. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow happened. I took pictures with my camera. My friends were impressed. The neighborhood stayed quiet for a little while. Then people came home from wherever they were.\n\nWe have a good community. We are close to the city of Charlotte. Every morning, we hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.\n\nWe have duplex homes on our street. Each one looks the same from the outside. But the inside is different. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I see deer and hear a bullfrog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live. We have a pond that is not for swimming. I like it here, 40 minutes from the city.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood one year before I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I made two friends who lived near me. One lives two houses down, and the other lives on my street. They do not live there anymore, but I still have happy memories. The people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. It has two-story houses and a park. I like this about my neighborhood.\n\nEvery weekend, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in my neighborhood. They leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and they have never been stolen from my porch.\n\nThe park is near my house. I have happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. But I also got hurt playing football. The good memories are more important. When I go to the park now, I spend time with my little cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and sad at the same time.\n\nMy neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short distance. Many people use apps to get food delivered. There are also fast food shops and pizza places. The stores near my house have everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. There are even stores that sell Indian food. I like my neighborhood.\n\nWhen I read about problems with neighbors on social media, I feel happy to have the friends and neighborhood I have.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is not a big town, but it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the welcome sign says. The town is mostly farmland with many peach trees and cattle. The houses are far apart and two stories high. They have metal or gray roofs to keep out the hot sun. Most houses are not near the road. They are far back so people can use the front land for animals and crops.\n\nIn the main part of town, there is one traffic light. This is where you will find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food. One is Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant. Another is Fiesta Mexican Restaurant. The third is Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it is closed now.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like to buy Cherry Coca-Cola there. There is one grocery store called IGA. It is not very big, so people often go to a bigger store in another town. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They deliver the furniture you buy. Next to the store is a place to take care of your pet called Clark's Cuts and Kennels.\n\nThe doctor and the vet are in separate buildings outside the main part of town. They are small, but they can help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. We are making a new park with a playground and other fun things. But right now, there is not much to do in our town. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or many restaurants. But it is a nice town. You can easily miss it if you are driving by!",
            "I first heard about my town on a podcast. It was about people who were missing. I was surprised. Almost every apartment in my area is expensive. It costs over one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story before. My friends did not know about it either. Maybe it is hard for people to hear. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive, but we have learned to save money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. When you grow up, you smell less. As an adult, you might smoke or you might just be used to things being this way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays in the leather even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, and a store with old books. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you cannot hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, the stores are quiet. It is a nice place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more and more people come to downtown. It is a growing city. One of the biggest companies for online shopping and delivery is here. It is still getting bigger. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. No one asks you for help. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. It is different from the South. In the South, people care about each other. They ask questions. You can keep to yourself in this city and it will not matter. It is a lively place to be. There is music from the man who plays the piano next door and the two singers upstairs. There is always something going on. We have less of an apartment of strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help each other when someone dies. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and I leave food for them. They do the same for me. It is nice to see them and I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but it is my neighbors who make me feel good about my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is very nice. It looks very well taken care of. The houses are all single family homes. The homeowner's association helps keep everything nice. The front yards are all the same. They have small lawns, some small rocks, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. As you drive around the neighborhood, you see new concrete roads. The roads are good. There are no potholes. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories. We don't have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail. There are two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is at the edge of the city. It's a mix of country and suburbs. We have a lot of space. There are many pools that everyone can use. They are well kept and locked. There are paths where you can walk your dog or take a walk. You don't need to go to a park to get exercise. The neighborhood is big, so you can run around it and get exercise. Many people who live here are retired. It's a safe area and people look out for each other. We also have some young and middle-aged people. The city is big in population, but it has a small town feel. We have many things you need, like a mall. It's not very big, but it's enough. I can drive 15 minutes and find many stores. There are high-end stores with organic food and stores with low prices and few employees. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. If we need to go shopping, we can drive to a big store.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. Many people who live here have low incomes. The houses are not expensive. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street. There is some crime in the area. A few people have been hurt in shootings. Our next-door neighbors' son was killed in a shooting last year. We have not been hurt by crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch.\n\nThe town is having problems with a sickness from a drug called fentanyl. Many people have died from it. But there are places to help people with addiction. My son goes to a good school. He has extra help because he needs it. He has friends and teachers who care about him. He loves his school. The school gives free food to all students. No one is treated differently because they do not have enough money.\n\nThe town is improving. They have fixed some roads and parks. But most of the changes are on the west side of town. My neighborhood is not as nice as some other parts of town. We like living here. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth a lot of money, but it is comfortable.\n\nWe have lived here for over 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. I live in a seven-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street is a fun bar that people like to visit on warm summer nights. People wait in line to get in on weekends during June and July.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is nice for the area. The park has concrete around it and wide stairs. During cold winter months, homeless people set up tents. It is warmer for them to be close together.\n\nI like my city's culture. It is not just about old buildings. The people are special. My neighborhood used to be bad because of gang violence. But the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city.\n\nSome people say if you are white, do not walk around at night. I think this is a reminder of the past. I am not white. I think the people like me because I understand their problems. They are kind to me. They help me.\n\nI feel good walking at night. People are nice. A laundromat owner let me charge my phone when I had no place to go. Someone gave me money and told me I am beautiful. The people here are special. I feel alive here.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a peaceful place. The town is near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. I like living here. It is a safe place. I can walk to many places. There is a park not far from my house. My neighborhood is quiet. Houses are not close together. They are old homes that have been updated. Many houses have yards with trampolines and playsets. People take care of their lawns. The grass is cut and the plants are trimmed.\n\nIt is a good place to raise a family. You can see children playing outside. People know each other in this town. They say hello when they see each other. The town has a sheriff's department and a health department. There is a recycling center where people take their trash. We also have baseball and softball fields. You can hear the announcers calling the games. There is a small airport near my house. I can hear the planes taking off and landing.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not perfect, but it is a good place to live. It is safe and peaceful. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is only a few blocks away. I can walk to get ice cream from a local shop. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. Residential areas and businesses are near each other. Some areas are for offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment. There are many new restaurants and stores to eat and shop at. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are also popular. They are in malls and on the streets. People walk to these stores. There are parks near my neighborhood. I see people with their young children in these parks.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of people. One area has a community of LGBTQ+ people, Orthodox Jews, and people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people of different races and backgrounds. They have their own communities in the city. We have Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are a short drive away. But traffic in my city is very bad. It takes a long time to drive a short distance, especially during rush hour. Almost no one walks in my city. We have a lot of traffic and hard-to-find parking spots.\n\nThe city is getting bigger. New apartment buildings are being built. Many people are moving to the city. Some residents do not want more people and traffic. There are many kinds of houses in my city. Not everyone lives in big apartment buildings. We have houses of different sizes and smaller buildings. Some homes are for one family, and others are for two families. My neighborhood is also made up of people of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. My neighborhood is not close like it used to be. I have good memories of playing with my friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses have been split into two. They are still connected. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway to the side. My neighborhood looks like it did a long time ago. People wanted to live in the suburbs then. It seemed like a good life. But now it is not the same. Many people still live here. They still like it. The people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not as nice as they used to be. But there are still cars in the driveways. The kids still play. They think the world is their whole world. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still stands. It makes the young people think about the future. It makes the older people remember the past. There are few churches. They are not very full. The basketball courts are always full. All the houses are different. But they feel the same. There is a big store called \"A\". It is owned by a big Yemeni family. They may be the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people are African American. The streets are wide. The kids usually play football. They stop to let cars pass. Most people have lived here for many years. They can tell stories about when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school. But now it is a pharmacy. Kids do not want to be like Daniel-san anymore. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a lower price. The young people do not like it. They think it is old-fashioned. The older people like it. They think it is a good way to spend the night out. There is one highway that goes through our town. The entrance and exit are in the next town. People wanted to put an entrance and exit in our town. But the older people said no. They said it would make our town less nice. The city agreed with them. They are building a new school. We are choosing a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol for my town.",
            "You might not see it at first. This is a residential area behind a shopping strip. People do not usually live here. At least, not many people want to live here. But if you go behind the old shopping center and walk to the back, you will find a community. There are many apartment buildings here. They are close together like a line of boxes.\n\nThe first group of apartments has bad news. We will not talk about it much. It looks bad, but it is not all bad. The other apartment buildings are nice. Many people live here. Across from these buildings is a college. It is a small group of buildings. Students go there to learn. They are quiet and sleepy in the morning. They drink coffee and go to class.\n\nThe road goes through this area. It meets another road. On one side is a park. Children play here. They run around and play games. On the other side is a place to help people with broken bones. The porch is nice and there is a fan to cool the air.\n\nMany people live in this area. They walk their dogs and go to the park. Some teenagers ride skateboards and talk to their friends. There is a place to buy food, a store for swimming pools, and a place for people to get manicures. You can buy food, fill your pool, and get a manicure all at the same time. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Many teenagers like to eat frozen yogurt and ride their skateboards.\n\nThis is a special place. It is a part of American history. Nothing much changes here. Time goes slowly.",
            "We drove through a big area with many corn fields. \"What is this place?\" she asked. \"This is it,\" I said. She was from a city where a store was just a short walk from her house. She had never seen so much open space before. I told her about where I grew up in rural Ohio. She understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a small road. We passed a big hole in the ground with water in it. My home was just beyond that. My neighborhood has houses made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land. People take care of their land and are very proud of it. In the spring, we plant flowers and trees. The trees change color with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars, like Mercedes. They shine in the sun after a car wash.\n\nMy neighbor was outside. He was a doctor in his younger years. Now he is older and has a lawn mower. He mows his lawn all day and sings while he works. Everyone likes him. He is a kind person with a special story.\n\nWe finally arrived at my home. There are geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. Behind my house, there is a small stream that flows into the hole in the ground. You can hear frogs, water, and animals from the farms nearby. There is a bridge made of wood over the stream. On the other side, there are trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and played with my friends. We had snow in the winter. The trees were bare and looked like skeletons. Sometimes it snowed and our yard looked like a winter wonderland. My sister and I would make snowmen and snow angels. We would fight and use snowballs as our weapons. We built forts and had fun in the snow.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special place. Some say it is \"weird\". This is shown by the town slogan, \"Keep Portland Weird\". It is written on a building that has a pizza joint, a bar, a music place, and a place where people dance. People like this slogan. To some, it means keep the old Portland alive. This is the Portland from the 1990s and early 2000s. It was not as famous and not as expensive. It made new and creative cultures. To others, it means come to Portland, where people like being different.\n\nMany rich people from California have moved to Portland. New houses are being built. But Portland is still weird. Weird means accepting things that others do not accept. But it does not mean Portland does not have new things. We buy things from China like other parts of the country. There are many ways to be weird. But Portland also has normal things. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird means not taking things too seriously.\n\nI live in a neighborhood with colorful houses, gardens, and boxes. Boxes are free things people give away. They can be used boxes or plastic bags. Inside the boxes, you can find nice things, like clothes and books. You can find anything. This is what Portland is all about. Or at least, it is what Portland is all about to me. There are many kinds of weird people in Portland. Some people will never pick up things from a box. They will go to goat yoga or watch the soccer team, the Timbers.\n\nPortland is full of people who love many things. We have people who chase our dreams, or think about chasing our dreams while we drink too much at the bar. Portland has problems. We have a drug problem. It usually comes from mental health problems. The rain and clouds can make people feel sad. We also have a homelessness problem. Many people come here because we have good services. But our services are not enough. People who have homes are sometimes kind, sometimes angry. This is the same in other parts of the country. We are not weird in feeling this way.",
            "There are mountains in the north. They watch the sun every day. They see the sun come up and go down. They are always there. I forget about them sometimes. Work and life take my attention. But they are still there. They are strong and steady. They do not change. When I am very stressed, I think about them. They remind me to take a deep breath and to be strong. I moved here when I started college. The mountains near my school were beautiful. I loved them at first. The school has nice buildings and a pond. But the mountains are special to me. The town is nice too. There are many coffee shops where I studied. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and interesting. There are old buildings and restaurants. It is busy and exciting. But it is not busy for long. I can go back to a quiet part of town. The library is there. It is a place to rest. I like this town because it is different in different parts. It is a nice place to live. I have good memories here. I walked with friends in the park. We went to the movies in a nice theater. But I also have sad memories. We all have sad memories. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I went to the pond at night and wondered about my life. I looked at the animals and thought about my purpose. I walked to the main street and saw the sun. The sun was shining and made the sky beautiful. I looked at the mountains and I felt strong. They reminded me to be strong and to keep going.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will have no trouble finding it. The city has good public transportation. Bensonhurst is a busy neighborhood like the rest of New York City. You will see many Asian stores as you walk. Many Asian people live in Bensonhurst. This is why you will find an Asian store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are popular. People like these stores because food is good, prices are low, and they are easy to use.\n\nNear my home, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This is helpful for buying groceries. Bensonhurst is a mixed area. Many immigrants and their children live here. Some big businesses in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby. The park has many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, a playground for children, and a water fountain for kids to play in during the summer.\n\nThe area has many small homes and co-op buildings. Few big buildings are here. Many people are friendly, but some can be noisy. Cars often play music loudly as they drive by. You may hear a car starting quickly in the morning. At night, be careful. Some people can be mean. You may meet people who want to cause trouble. I was once bullied here. But that was a long time ago. Recently, someone took a package from my home. This is a common problem in Bensonhurst. People do not clean up after their dogs. Every day, you will see dog waste on the street. This is my biggest problem.",
            "I live in a place with few sidewalks. People have to walk on the road because there are no sidewalks. The road can be a little bit bad to drive on because it has holes in some places. There are many telephone and electric wires above the road. They look bad because they get broken in storms and need to be fixed many times.\n\nMy house is at the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work-out hill\" because many runners like to run up the hill. The houses are built high up so people can see the ocean.\n\nThere are many tall trees around my house. People do not like the trees because they block the view of the ocean. But the trees are nice when the sun sets. The water looks nice and the sky turns orange.\n\nIt often rains and storms in our area. Moss grows on everything, including houses, cars and railings. One time I left my car outside for a month and it got covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. The people are mostly older and many are retired. They have dogs instead of children. The dogs are always running around and sometimes they get into people's houses.\n\nWe have many wild rabbits. They dig up gardens and burrow into lawns. My cats like to catch them and there are not many rabbits left in our neighborhood.\n\nWe see many birds, like small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores in my neighborhood. But if you walk down to the waterfront, you can find some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not very big, but it is fun to throw rocks into the water.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street between two main roads. This means we have some traffic, but it is a quiet neighborhood. People do not move in and out often. I know most of my neighbors. They work in their yards and do other daily things. In the winter, we sled down a small hill. We live at the corner of the street. We see all the people who come and go. We take note of strangers' cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. We are at home a lot. We go outside and play, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck. It smells good. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. It is a wooded area, so we have trees and shade. We rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. We do not have much winter. It feels like a long fall. My garage is at the back of the house. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel close to my neighbors. On holidays, it is quiet. We have visitors on Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. I like living here. If the street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the middle of a dry and sandy area. This area is very different from many other places. When you look around, you see mostly brown and dirt. It is not very green like some other places. Sometimes I see a small green area, like a lawn. But this is very expensive to take care of. When I first moved here, there were many houses far apart. Now there are more houses, and it looks like a small city.\n\nPeople in my neighborhood are generally friendly. But, like any place, it has good and bad parts. Many old people live in my neighborhood, and it is a nice place. There are some stores, but not many. Most of the stores are part of big chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. My city is not very developed, and there are many open spaces. This is why many people work in construction. I work in construction, too. I install drywall and T-bars for a living.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the animals. People come to our area to see the beauty of the desert. The desert has a special climate and geography that supports many different kinds of wildlife. People who live here should learn about the animals that live here so we can live together safely. My family loves animals, and we have learned a lot about them. We even try to catch them when we can. If you come to visit, there are some things to see. Victorville is a good place for families to learn about the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair, which is a fun event. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, like rocks, old bones, and Native American artifacts.",
            "My neighborhood is the college campus where I live. I live in a dormitory with many people from different countries and ages. My neighborhood also includes the campus area around my dorm. I like my neighborhood. It has many things like homes, people, stores, and a park.\n\nLet's talk about the homes in my neighborhood. There are three kinds of homes. Some are apartments, some are houses, and some are dorm rooms. Apartments have 2-4 people in each room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Some buildings are 2 floors high. So, about 20 people live in each building. Some houses are for rent. They have 2-4 bedrooms. Only a few people live in these houses. Most students live in dorm rooms. Two people share a room, sometimes.\n\nMy college is proud of its diversity. People from many countries and ages live in my neighborhood. Some staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms and older students live in apartments. Let's talk about the stores and park. My school is a closed neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food, clothes, and things we need. We can buy anything we need in our neighborhood. The park is a fun place for everyone. It is clean and safe because all neighbors take care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I am happy to share what I know about it. When I first came here, I was sad. I missed my friends and family from Riverdale. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to Stockbridge. Our new neighborhood was better. It had good housing and a good high school. I made new friends and enemies in school. I did not get to know my neighbors very well, but I liked Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind people. I remember their wedding. My family and I attended. We had a good time. I even caught a white strap that Mrs. Glen took off her leg. I did not catch the flowers, though. I like to visit the park and walk in nature. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance with sticks. I have a wooden sword that I like to play with. There is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. We had fun, but we worked hard. I hope I can play again. I have had some happy times in this neighborhood. I think there is more to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. It is very convenient for me. Many apartment buildings are in my area. Some are old, but they have been renovated inside. There are also some restaurants and bars. They are fun to go to and not very expensive. One bar changed its name recently. It is a bit more expensive, but the service and drinks are good.\n\nMost people in my area are students or have low incomes. They live in apartments because they are not very expensive. There is an elementary school near my home. Many children live in the area. My neighbors are not very friendly. They smoke a lot. I do not want to know them.\n\nMy apartment building is old, but it has a lot of trees around it. Some trees were cut down, but there are still many trees. The street behind my building has another set of apartments. The street next to mine is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on that street to hide the bad buildings. Much crime happens on that street. But crime happens in other places too.\n\nI like where I live. I can afford it. There are many good things near my home. The college is close, and I can easily ride a bus to go shopping or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a circle street. They look like individual houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone is friends with each other. We stand at the end of our driveways sometimes and talk while our children play outside. It is nice to be in a place without many cars and computers. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies with white clouds. But we also have problems. This season, we have had tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the tornado sirens. We went to our shelter. I was in my bathtub with my small dog and a few things. My big dog stayed in the living room. It was quiet outside except for the sound of hail on the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road was hot. We had a big change in temperature. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow happened. I took pictures with my camera. My friends were impressed. The neighborhood stayed quiet for a little while. Then people came home from wherever they were.\n\nWe have a good community. We are close to the city of Charlotte. Every morning, we hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.\n\nWe have duplex homes on our street. Each one looks the same from the outside. But the inside is different. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I see deer and hear a bullfrog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live. We have a pond that is not for swimming. I like it here, 40 minutes from the city.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood one year before I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I made two friends who lived near me. One lives two houses down, and the other lives on my street. They do not live there anymore, but I still have happy memories. The people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. It has two-story houses and a park. I like this about my neighborhood.\n\nEvery weekend, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in my neighborhood. They leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and they have never been stolen from my porch.\n\nThe park is near my house. I have happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. But I also got hurt playing football. The good memories are more important. When I go to the park now, I spend time with my little cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and sad at the same time.\n\nMy neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short distance. Many people use apps to get food delivered. There are also fast food shops and pizza places. The stores near my house have everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. There are even stores that sell Indian food. I like my neighborhood.\n\nWhen I read about problems with neighbors on social media, I feel happy to have the friends and neighborhood I have.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is not a big town, but it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the welcome sign says. The town is mostly farmland with many peach trees and cattle. The houses are far apart and two stories high. They have metal or gray roofs to keep out the hot sun. Most houses are not near the road. They are far back so people can use the front land for animals and crops.\n\nIn the main part of town, there is one traffic light. This is where you will find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food. One is Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant. Another is Fiesta Mexican Restaurant. The third is Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it is closed now.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like to buy Cherry Coca-Cola there. There is one grocery store called IGA. It is not very big, so people often go to a bigger store in another town. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They deliver the furniture you buy. Next to the store is a place to take care of your pet called Clark's Cuts and Kennels.\n\nThe doctor and the vet are in separate buildings outside the main part of town. They are small, but they can help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. We are making a new park with a playground and other fun things. But right now, there is not much to do in our town. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or many restaurants. But it is a nice town. You can easily miss it if you are driving by!",
            "I first heard about my town on a podcast. It was about people who were missing. I was surprised. Almost every apartment in my area is expensive. It costs over one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story before. My friends did not know about it either. Maybe it is hard for people to hear. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive, but we have learned to save money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. When you grow up, you smell less. As an adult, you might smoke or you might just be used to things being this way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays in the leather even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, and a store with old books. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you cannot hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, the stores are quiet. It is a nice place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more and more people come to downtown. It is a growing city. One of the biggest companies for online shopping and delivery is here. It is still getting bigger. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. No one asks you for help. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. It is different from the South. In the South, people care about each other. They ask questions. You can keep to yourself in this city and it will not matter. It is a lively place to be. There is music from the man who plays the piano next door and the two singers upstairs. There is always something going on. We have less of an apartment of strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help each other when someone dies. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and I leave food for them. They do the same for me. It is nice to see them and I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but it is my neighbors who make me feel good about my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is very nice. It looks very well taken care of. The houses are all single family homes. The homeowner's association helps keep everything nice. The front yards are all the same. They have small lawns, some small rocks, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. As you drive around the neighborhood, you see new concrete roads. The roads are good. There are no potholes. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories. We don't have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail. There are two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is at the edge of the city. It's a mix of country and suburbs. We have a lot of space. There are many pools that everyone can use. They are well kept and locked. There are paths where you can walk your dog or take a walk. You don't need to go to a park to get exercise. The neighborhood is big, so you can run around it and get exercise. Many people who live here are retired. It's a safe area and people look out for each other. We also have some young and middle-aged people. The city is big in population, but it has a small town feel. We have many things you need, like a mall. It's not very big, but it's enough. I can drive 15 minutes and find many stores. There are high-end stores with organic food and stores with low prices and few employees. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. If we need to go shopping, we can drive to a big store.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. Many people who live here have low incomes. The houses are not expensive. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street. There is some crime in the area. A few people have been hurt in shootings. Our next-door neighbors' son was killed in a shooting last year. We have not been hurt by crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch.\n\nThe town is having problems with a sickness from a drug called fentanyl. Many people have died from it. But there are places to help people with addiction. My son goes to a good school. He has extra help because he needs it. He has friends and teachers who care about him. He loves his school. The school gives free food to all students. No one is treated differently because they do not have enough money.\n\nThe town is improving. They have fixed some roads and parks. But most of the changes are on the west side of town. My neighborhood is not as nice as some other parts of town. We like living here. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth a lot of money, but it is comfortable.\n\nWe have lived here for over 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. I live in a seven-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street is a fun bar that people like to visit on warm summer nights. People wait in line to get in on weekends during June and July.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is nice for the area. The park has concrete around it and wide stairs. During cold winter months, homeless people set up tents. It is warmer for them to be close together.\n\nI like my city's culture. It is not just about old buildings. The people are special. My neighborhood used to be bad because of gang violence. But the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city.\n\nSome people say if you are white, do not walk around at night. I think this is a reminder of the past. I am not white. I think the people like me because I understand their problems. They are kind to me. They help me.\n\nI feel good walking at night. People are nice. A laundromat owner let me charge my phone when I had no place to go. Someone gave me money and told me I am beautiful. The people here are special. I feel alive here.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a peaceful place. The town is near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. I like living here. It is a safe place. I can walk to many places. There is a park not far from my house. My neighborhood is quiet. Houses are not close together. They are old homes that have been updated. Many houses have yards with trampolines and playsets. People take care of their lawns. The grass is cut and the plants are trimmed.\n\nIt is a good place to raise a family. You can see children playing outside. People know each other in this town. They say hello when they see each other. The town has a sheriff's department and a health department. There is a recycling center where people take their trash. We also have baseball and softball fields. You can hear the announcers calling the games. There is a small airport near my house. I can hear the planes taking off and landing.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not perfect, but it is a good place to live. It is safe and peaceful. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is only a few blocks away. I can walk to get ice cream from a local shop. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience.

            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "I live in a big city. My neighborhood is very different. Residential areas and businesses are near each other. Some areas are for offices, stores, restaurants, and entertainment. There are many new restaurants and stores to eat and shop at. Some stores are big and well-known, but small stores are also popular. They are in malls and on the streets. People walk to these stores. There are parks near my neighborhood. I see people with their young children in these parks.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of people. One area has a community of LGBTQ+ people, Orthodox Jews, and people from the former Soviet Union. Outside my neighborhood, there are many more people of different races and backgrounds. They have their own communities in the city. We have Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia, which are a short drive away. But traffic in my city is very bad. It takes a long time to drive a short distance, especially during rush hour. Almost no one walks in my city. We have a lot of traffic and hard-to-find parking spots.\n\nThe city is getting bigger. New apartment buildings are being built. Many people are moving to the city. Some residents do not want more people and traffic. There are many kinds of houses in my city. Not everyone lives in big apartment buildings. We have houses of different sizes and smaller buildings. Some homes are for one family, and others are for two families. My neighborhood is also made up of people of different ages. I do not know most of my neighbors. My neighborhood is not close like it used to be. I have good memories of playing with my friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some houses have been split into two. They are still connected. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway to the side. My neighborhood looks like it did a long time ago. People wanted to live in the suburbs then. It seemed like a good life. But now it is not the same. Many people still live here. They still like it. The people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not as nice as they used to be. But there are still cars in the driveways. The kids still play. They think the world is their whole world. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still stands. It makes the young people think about the future. It makes the older people remember the past. There are few churches. They are not very full. The basketball courts are always full. All the houses are different. But they feel the same. There is a big store called \"A\". It is owned by a big Yemeni family. They may be the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people are African American. The streets are wide. The kids usually play football. They stop to let cars pass. Most people have lived here for many years. They can tell stories about when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school. But now it is a pharmacy. Kids do not want to be like Daniel-san anymore. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a lower price. The young people do not like it. They think it is old-fashioned. The older people like it. They think it is a good way to spend the night out. There is one highway that goes through our town. The entrance and exit are in the next town. People wanted to put an entrance and exit in our town. But the older people said no. They said it would make our town less nice. The city agreed with them. They are building a new school. We are choosing a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good symbol for my town.",
            "You might not see it at first. This is a residential area behind a shopping strip. People do not usually live here. At least, not many people want to live here. But if you go behind the old shopping center and walk to the back, you will find a community. There are many apartment buildings here. They are close together like a line of boxes.\n\nThe first group of apartments has bad news. We will not talk about it much. It looks bad, but it is not all bad. The other apartment buildings are nice. Many people live here. Across from these buildings is a college. It is a small group of buildings. Students go there to learn. They are quiet and sleepy in the morning. They drink coffee and go to class.\n\nThe road goes through this area. It meets another road. On one side is a park. Children play here. They run around and play games. On the other side is a place to help people with broken bones. The porch is nice and there is a fan to cool the air.\n\nMany people live in this area. They walk their dogs and go to the park. Some teenagers ride skateboards and talk to their friends. There is a place to buy food, a store for swimming pools, and a place for people to get manicures. You can buy food, fill your pool, and get a manicure all at the same time. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Many teenagers like to eat frozen yogurt and ride their skateboards.\n\nThis is a special place. It is a part of American history. Nothing much changes here. Time goes slowly.",
            "We drove through a big area with many corn fields. \"What is this place?\" she asked. \"This is it,\" I said. She was from a city where a store was just a short walk from her house. She had never seen so much open space before. I told her about where I grew up in rural Ohio. She understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a small road. We passed a big hole in the ground with water in it. My home was just beyond that. My neighborhood has houses made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land. People take care of their land and are very proud of it. In the spring, we plant flowers and trees. The trees change color with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars, like Mercedes. They shine in the sun after a car wash.\n\nMy neighbor was outside. He was a doctor in his younger years. Now he is older and has a lawn mower. He mows his lawn all day and sings while he works. Everyone likes him. He is a kind person with a special story.\n\nWe finally arrived at my home. There are geese in the yard. Our dog chases them. Behind my house, there is a small stream that flows into the hole in the ground. You can hear frogs, water, and animals from the farms nearby. There is a bridge made of wood over the stream. On the other side, there are trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and played with my friends. We had snow in the winter. The trees were bare and looked like skeletons. Sometimes it snowed and our yard looked like a winter wonderland. My sister and I would make snowmen and snow angels. We would fight and use snowballs as our weapons. We built forts and had fun in the snow.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special place. Some say it is \"weird\". This is shown by the town slogan, \"Keep Portland Weird\". It is written on a building that has a pizza joint, a bar, a music place, and a place where people dance. People like this slogan. To some, it means keep the old Portland alive. This is the Portland from the 1990s and early 2000s. It was not as famous and not as expensive. It made new and creative cultures. To others, it means come to Portland, where people like being different.\n\nMany rich people from California have moved to Portland. New houses are being built. But Portland is still weird. Weird means accepting things that others do not accept. But it does not mean Portland does not have new things. We buy things from China like other parts of the country. There are many ways to be weird. But Portland also has normal things. We have yoga, hipsters, and business people. Maybe being weird means not taking things too seriously.\n\nI live in a neighborhood with colorful houses, gardens, and boxes. Boxes are free things people give away. They can be used boxes or plastic bags. Inside the boxes, you can find nice things, like clothes and books. You can find anything. This is what Portland is all about. Or at least, it is what Portland is all about to me. There are many kinds of weird people in Portland. Some people will never pick up things from a box. They will go to goat yoga or watch the soccer team, the Timbers.\n\nPortland is full of people who love many things. We have people who chase our dreams, or think about chasing our dreams while we drink too much at the bar. Portland has problems. We have a drug problem. It usually comes from mental health problems. The rain and clouds can make people feel sad. We also have a homelessness problem. Many people come here because we have good services. But our services are not enough. People who have homes are sometimes kind, sometimes angry. This is the same in other parts of the country. We are not weird in feeling this way.",
            "There are mountains in the north. They watch the sun every day. They see the sun come up and go down. They are always there. I forget about them sometimes. Work and life take my attention. But they are still there. They are strong and steady. They do not change. When I am very stressed, I think about them. They remind me to take a deep breath and to be strong. I moved here when I started college. The mountains near my school were beautiful. I loved them at first. The school has nice buildings and a pond. But the mountains are special to me. The town is nice too. There are many coffee shops where I studied. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and interesting. There are old buildings and restaurants. It is busy and exciting. But it is not busy for long. I can go back to a quiet part of town. The library is there. It is a place to rest. I like this town because it is different in different parts. It is a nice place to live. I have good memories here. I walked with friends in the park. We went to the movies in a nice theater. But I also have sad memories. We all have sad memories. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I went to the pond at night and wondered about my life. I looked at the animals and thought about my purpose. I walked to the main street and saw the sun. The sun was shining and made the sky beautiful. I looked at the mountains and I felt strong. They reminded me to be strong and to keep going.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you will have no trouble finding it. The city has good public transportation. Bensonhurst is a busy neighborhood like the rest of New York City. You will see many Asian stores as you walk. Many Asian people live in Bensonhurst. This is why you will find an Asian store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are popular. People like these stores because food is good, prices are low, and they are easy to use.\n\nNear my home, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This is helpful for buying groceries. Bensonhurst is a mixed area. Many immigrants and their children live here. Some big businesses in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby. The park has many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, a playground for children, and a water fountain for kids to play in during the summer.\n\nThe area has many small homes and co-op buildings. Few big buildings are here. Many people are friendly, but some can be noisy. Cars often play music loudly as they drive by. You may hear a car starting quickly in the morning. At night, be careful. Some people can be mean. You may meet people who want to cause trouble. I was once bullied here. But that was a long time ago. Recently, someone took a package from my home. This is a common problem in Bensonhurst. People do not clean up after their dogs. Every day, you will see dog waste on the street. This is my biggest problem.",
            "I live in a place with few sidewalks. People have to walk on the road because there are no sidewalks. The road can be a little bit bad to drive on because it has holes in some places. There are many telephone and electric wires above the road. They look bad because they get broken in storms and need to be fixed many times.\n\nMy house is at the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work-out hill\" because many runners like to run up the hill. The houses are built high up so people can see the ocean.\n\nThere are many tall trees around my house. People do not like the trees because they block the view of the ocean. But the trees are nice when the sun sets. The water looks nice and the sky turns orange.\n\nIt often rains and storms in our area. Moss grows on everything, including houses, cars and railings. One time I left my car outside for a month and it got covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. The people are mostly older and many are retired. They have dogs instead of children. The dogs are always running around and sometimes they get into people's houses.\n\nWe have many wild rabbits. They dig up gardens and burrow into lawns. My cats like to catch them and there are not many rabbits left in our neighborhood.\n\nWe see many birds, like small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores in my neighborhood. But if you walk down to the waterfront, you can find some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The beach is not very big, but it is fun to throw rocks into the water.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street between two main roads. This means we have some traffic, but it is a quiet neighborhood. People do not move in and out often. I know most of my neighbors. They work in their yards and do other daily things. In the winter, we sled down a small hill. We live at the corner of the street. We see all the people who come and go. We take note of strangers' cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. We are at home a lot. We go outside and play, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck. It smells good. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from March to October. It is a wooded area, so we have trees and shade. We rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. We do not have much winter. It feels like a long fall. My garage is at the back of the house. I like to work on my truck in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel close to my neighbors. On holidays, it is quiet. We have visitors on Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. I like living here. If the street were not a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the middle of a dry and sandy area. This area is very different from many other places. When you look around, you see mostly brown and dirt. It is not very green like some other places. Sometimes I see a small green area, like a lawn. But this is very expensive to take care of. When I first moved here, there were many houses far apart. Now there are more houses, and it looks like a small city.\n\nPeople in my neighborhood are generally friendly. But, like any place, it has good and bad parts. Many old people live in my neighborhood, and it is a nice place. There are some stores, but not many. Most of the stores are part of big chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. My city is not very developed, and there are many open spaces. This is why many people work in construction. I work in construction, too. I install drywall and T-bars for a living.\n\nI like my neighborhood because of the animals. People come to our area to see the beauty of the desert. The desert has a special climate and geography that supports many different kinds of wildlife. People who live here should learn about the animals that live here so we can live together safely. My family loves animals, and we have learned a lot about them. We even try to catch them when we can. If you come to visit, there are some things to see. Victorville is a good place for families to learn about the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair, which is a fun event. You can also visit Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and learn winter sports. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, like rocks, old bones, and Native American artifacts.",
            "My neighborhood is the college campus where I live. I live in a dormitory with many people from different countries and ages. My neighborhood also includes the campus area around my dorm. I like my neighborhood. It has many things like homes, people, stores, and a park.\n\nLet's talk about the homes in my neighborhood. There are three kinds of homes. Some are apartments, some are houses, and some are dorm rooms. Apartments have 2-4 people in each room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Some buildings are 2 floors high. So, about 20 people live in each building. Some houses are for rent. They have 2-4 bedrooms. Only a few people live in these houses. Most students live in dorm rooms. Two people share a room, sometimes.\n\nMy college is proud of its diversity. People from many countries and ages live in my neighborhood. Some staff members live in houses. New students live in dorms and older students live in apartments. Let's talk about the stores and park. My school is a closed neighborhood. It has many stores and one park. The stores have food, clothes, and things we need. We can buy anything we need in our neighborhood. The park is a fun place for everyone. It is clean and safe because all neighbors take care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for 10 years. I am happy to share what I know about it. When I first came here, I was sad. I missed my friends and family from Riverdale. My mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to Stockbridge. Our new neighborhood was better. It had good housing and a good high school. I made new friends and enemies in school. I did not get to know my neighbors very well, but I liked Mr. Glen and his children. They are kind people. I remember their wedding. My family and I attended. We had a good time. I even caught a white strap that Mrs. Glen took off her leg. I did not catch the flowers, though. I like to visit the park and walk in nature. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance with sticks. I have a wooden sword that I like to play with. There is a basketball and tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. We had fun, but we worked hard. I hope I can play again. I have had some happy times in this neighborhood. I think there is more to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. It is very convenient for me. Many apartment buildings are in my area. Some are old, but they have been renovated inside. There are also some restaurants and bars. They are fun to go to and not very expensive. One bar changed its name recently. It is a bit more expensive, but the service and drinks are good.\n\nMost people in my area are students or have low incomes. They live in apartments because they are not very expensive. There is an elementary school near my home. Many children live in the area. My neighbors are not very friendly. They smoke a lot. I do not want to know them.\n\nMy apartment building is old, but it has a lot of trees around it. Some trees were cut down, but there are still many trees. The street behind my building has another set of apartments. The street next to mine is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on that street to hide the bad buildings. Much crime happens on that street. But crime happens in other places too.\n\nI like where I live. I can afford it. There are many good things near my home. The college is close, and I can easily ride a bus to go shopping or downtown.",
            "My neighborhood has duplex homes on a circle street. They look like individual houses. Each one is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone is friends with each other. We stand at the end of our driveways sometimes and talk while our children play outside. It is nice to be in a place without many cars and computers. It is like going back in time.\n\nWe are surrounded by fields, trees, and blue skies with white clouds. But we also have problems. This season, we have had tornado warnings. Last night, we heard the tornado sirens. We went to our shelter. I was in my bathtub with my small dog and a few things. My big dog stayed in the living room. It was quiet outside except for the sound of hail on the ground.\n\nAfter the storm, the road was hot. We had a big change in temperature. The hail melted on the hot pavement. The sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow happened. I took pictures with my camera. My friends were impressed. The neighborhood stayed quiet for a little while. Then people came home from wherever they were.\n\nWe have a good community. We are close to the city of Charlotte. Every morning, we hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.\n\nWe have duplex homes on our street. Each one looks the same from the outside. But the inside is different. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I see deer and hear a bullfrog singing in the morning. It is a great place to live. We have a pond that is not for swimming. I like it here, 40 minutes from the city.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood one year before I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I made two friends who lived near me. One lives two houses down, and the other lives on my street. They do not live there anymore, but I still have happy memories. The people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American neighborhoods. It has two-story houses and a park. I like this about my neighborhood.\n\nEvery weekend, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in my neighborhood. They leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many packages online and they have never been stolen from my porch.\n\nThe park is near my house. I have happy memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. But I also got hurt playing football. The good memories are more important. When I go to the park now, I spend time with my little cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and sad at the same time.\n\nMy neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short distance. Many people use apps to get food delivered. There are also fast food shops and pizza places. The stores near my house have everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a grocery store. There are even stores that sell Indian food. I like my neighborhood.\n\nWhen I read about problems with neighbors on social media, I feel happy to have the friends and neighborhood I have.",
            "I live in a small town in South Carolina. It is not a big town, but it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the welcome sign says. The town is mostly farmland with many peach trees and cattle. The houses are far apart and two stories high. They have metal or gray roofs to keep out the hot sun. Most houses are not near the road. They are far back so people can use the front land for animals and crops.\n\nIn the main part of town, there is one traffic light. This is where you will find the town's stores. There are three places to get fast food. One is Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant. Another is Fiesta Mexican Restaurant. The third is Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it is closed now.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People like to buy Cherry Coca-Cola there. There is one grocery store called IGA. It is not very big, so people often go to a bigger store in another town. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They deliver the furniture you buy. Next to the store is a place to take care of your pet called Clark's Cuts and Kennels.\n\nThe doctor and the vet are in separate buildings outside the main part of town. They are small, but they can help the people of Johnston. There is one school called Johnston Elementary School. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. We are making a new park with a playground and other fun things. But right now, there is not much to do in our town. We do not have a movie theater, bowling alley, or many restaurants. But it is a nice town. You can easily miss it if you are driving by!",
            "I first heard about my town on a podcast. It was about people who were missing. I was surprised. Almost every apartment in my area is expensive. It costs over one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story before. My friends did not know about it either. Maybe it is hard for people to hear. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive, but we have learned to save money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. When you grow up, you smell less. As an adult, you might smoke or you might just be used to things being this way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on a piano is strong. It stays in the leather even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start on one side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, and a store with old books. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you cannot hear it in the thrift stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, the stores are quiet. It is a nice place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more and more people come to downtown. It is a growing city. One of the biggest companies for online shopping and delivery is here. It is still getting bigger. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. No one asks you for help. You can be alone and people will leave you alone. It is different from the South. In the South, people care about each other. They ask questions. You can keep to yourself in this city and it will not matter. It is a lively place to be. There is music from the man who plays the piano next door and the two singers upstairs. There is always something going on. We have less of an apartment of strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and help each other when someone dies. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and I leave food for them. They do the same for me. It is nice to see them and I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but it is my neighbors who make me feel good about my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is very nice. It looks very well taken care of. The houses are all single family homes. The homeowner's association helps keep everything nice. The front yards are all the same. They have small lawns, some small rocks, and short driveways. Some houses have two cars. As you drive around the neighborhood, you see new concrete roads. The roads are good. There are no potholes. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories. We don't have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many boxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get your mail. There are two big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is at the edge of the city. It's a mix of country and suburbs. We have a lot of space. There are many pools that everyone can use. They are well kept and locked. There are paths where you can walk your dog or take a walk. You don't need to go to a park to get exercise. The neighborhood is big, so you can run around it and get exercise. Many people who live here are retired. It's a safe area and people look out for each other. We also have some young and middle-aged people. The city is big in population, but it has a small town feel. We have many things you need, like a mall. It's not very big, but it's enough. I can drive 15 minutes and find many stores. There are high-end stores with organic food and stores with low prices and few employees. My neighborhood is safe, clean, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and walking paths. If we need to go shopping, we can drive to a big store.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. Many people who live here have low incomes. The houses are not expensive. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street. There is some crime in the area. A few people have been hurt in shootings. Our next-door neighbors' son was killed in a shooting last year. We have not been hurt by crime. Sometimes we lose small things from our porch.\n\nThe town is having problems with a sickness from a drug called fentanyl. Many people have died from it. But there are places to help people with addiction. My son goes to a good school. He has extra help because he needs it. He has friends and teachers who care about him. He loves his school. The school gives free food to all students. No one is treated differently because they do not have enough money.\n\nThe town is improving. They have fixed some roads and parks. But most of the changes are on the west side of town. My neighborhood is not as nice as some other parts of town. We like living here. People are friendly, the schools are good, and there are many stores to buy things. Our home is not worth a lot of money, but it is comfortable.\n\nWe have lived here for over 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. I live in a seven-story apartment building near an old theater. Across the street is a fun bar that people like to visit on warm summer nights. People wait in line to get in on weekends during June and July.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is nice for the area. The park has concrete around it and wide stairs. During cold winter months, homeless people set up tents. It is warmer for them to be close together.\n\nI like my city's culture. It is not just about old buildings. The people are special. My neighborhood used to be bad because of gang violence. But the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city.\n\nSome people say if you are white, do not walk around at night. I think this is a reminder of the past. I am not white. I think the people like me because I understand their problems. They are kind to me. They help me.\n\nI feel good walking at night. People are nice. A laundromat owner let me charge my phone when I had no place to go. Someone gave me money and told me I am beautiful. The people here are special. I feel alive here.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a peaceful place. The town is near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. I like living here. It is a safe place. I can walk to many places. There is a park not far from my house. My neighborhood is quiet. Houses are not close together. They are old homes that have been updated. Many houses have yards with trampolines and playsets. People take care of their lawns. The grass is cut and the plants are trimmed.\n\nIt is a good place to raise a family. You can see children playing outside. People know each other in this town. They say hello when they see each other. The town has a sheriff's department and a health department. There is a recycling center where people take their trash. We also have baseball and softball fields. You can hear the announcers calling the games. There is a small airport near my house. I can hear the planes taking off and landing.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not perfect, but it is a good place to live. It is safe and peaceful. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is only a few blocks away. I can walk to get ice cream from a local shop. It is a great place to live."
