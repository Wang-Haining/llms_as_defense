            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Many people like the Asian stores because they are good, cheap, and convenient. I live nearby. There are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This makes it easy to buy food.\n\nBensonhurt is not just Asian people. It is a mix of people from many countries. Immigrants and their children live here. Most of the big businesses are owned by Asians. There is also a park nearby. It has many things for people to do. There are basketball courts, a big field, handball courts, and a playground for children. In the summer, children can play with water.\n\nThe buildings in Bensonhurt are not very tall. Most people live in small houses or apartments. The people here are nice, but it can be noisy. You will hear cars with loud music and people driving fast. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurt is usually safe, but some people can be mean. I was once hurt here, but it was a long time ago. Recently, some people stole packages from houses. People also do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the ground every morning. Keep your shoes clean when you walk around.",
            "I live in a place where there are few sidewalks. A big hill is near my house. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many people like to run up it. The road I live on is not good for driving. There are many holes in it. Everyone walks on the road because there are no sidewalks. The telephone and electric wires around our block are old and broken. It rains a lot where I live. The wind and rain break the wires and cause problems. We have to repair them often.\n\nThere are many big trees in my area. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to look at the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset when the water is lit from below and the sky is orange. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on many things: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car alone for a month, and when I got back, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near my house. But most people in my area are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs like to run in people's yards or down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nWe also have rabbits in our area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see many birds: small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles fly by. The neighborhood crows chase them away. We do not have stores nearby, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The bay is not very wide, but you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a typical neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. The town is between two state highways. We have some traffic on our street, but it is mostly quiet. Few people move in and out of the neighborhood, so I know most of the people who live here. They like to take care of their lawns and do other daily tasks. In the winter, we sled down a hill on the side street. Our house is at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going. We pay attention to any strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and play. We are home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us: my wife and two daughters (eleven and fourteen years old). So, everyone is used to us coming and going. We go outside and play, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck and it smells nice. We can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. We have many trees, so it is shady. We have to rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. It is a sign that fall has arrived. We do not have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. I like to work in my garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. It is quiet on holidays. Thanksgiving and other holidays have extra cars because people visit from out of town. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the high desert. It is a very dry place with much dirt. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like to see brown everywhere. When I first moved here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now, there are many more houses. My neighborhood is becoming more like a city. But this is true of many places.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are friendly. However, like many cities, it has good and bad parts. I live near many older people. They are kind. In my neighborhood, there are many stores with chains, such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want organic food, you must go to a different place. \n\nThe main jobs in my city are in construction. This is because my city is still growing and there is much space to build. I am worried about this. I do not want my city to change too much. I came from a big city and do not want to go back.\n\nMy job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bar. What I like about my home is the animals. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has many plants and animals that need protecting. It is good to learn about these animals so we can live together safely. My family and I like the animals. My three children like to catch lizards and bugs.\n\nWe have some fun things to do in my city. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. You can see the snow-covered mountains and take lessons to learn how to ski. If you like history and nature, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many things to show you about the desert and the people who live here.",
            "I live in a special kind of neighborhood. It is not like other neighborhoods. I live on a college campus. My dormitory is my community. I also consider the campus around me my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses where I live. First, there are apartments. Each apartment has four rooms. Twenty people live in each building. Second, there are houses that people rent. These houses have two or four bedrooms. Not many people live in these houses. Finally, there are rooms in the dormitory where two people live. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nPeople from many countries and ages live in my neighborhood. The school is proud of its diversity. Most of the staff live in the houses. New students live in the dormitory. Older students live in the apartments.\n\nLet's talk about the stores. My school is a closed community. It has many stores. There are places to buy food, clothes and other things. All the things people need are in the neighborhood.\n\nThere is a park in my neighborhood. It is a good place for people to play. The park is clean and safe. All the people in my neighborhood help keep it that way.",
            "I live in my neighborhood for 10 years. I was sad when I first moved here. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and friends. But my mom and dad said this was a better place for us. We have a good house and a good school. It was not a bad neighborhood.\n\nOver time, I got used to it. I made some new friends. I also made some enemies in school. I did not know my neighbors very well. But Mr. Glen and his family were nice. They lived next to us. I also knew Dennis a little bit.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I danced with his daughter, Marsharii. I hope she is doing well. My mom and dad and my sister also went to the wedding. We all had a good time.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. But I have a GPS now. I can explore it more. I like to play video games with my friends Kason and Curtis. We have fun together. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm.\n\nI like to practice my balance with sticks. I also like to play with my bokken wooden sword. There are a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. They made us practice hard. But we had fun.\n\nI have had some good times in this neighborhood. I have a lot of memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. This is good for me. I like it. There are many apartment buildings in my neighborhood. Some restaurants and bars are also near me. These places are fun to visit and not very expensive. One of the bars was recently renamed. It costs more money to go there, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people in my neighborhood are nice. They are either college students or they do not have a lot of money. The apartments are not very expensive. There is a school near me for young children. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My landlord put a machine in their apartment to make the air smell good. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It feels insulting. The buildings around me are old and may need repair. A little ways down the street are new apartments. I do not like them. They are not well built, but the rent is high. I think this is unfair. They are close to the college, so the landlords can charge a lot of money. There is a cheap restaurant near me that serves food on paper plates. Most of the food is heated in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is a bad place to work. The city gave some money to fix the road near my apartment. Now the sidewalk is big and nice, and there are many trees and grass. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. Some of these trees were cut down, but there are many still left. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street. The street behind me is 43rd street. This street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they may be hiding the condition of the buildings. Many crimes have happened at an apartment complex on this street. But I do not blame them. There are also apartments across from me with problems. But I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many useful things near me. I like being close to the university and the two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses on a special street. The houses are close to each other and look like small towns. They have yellow paint and white porches. Almost everyone knows each other. We often stand at the end of our driveways and talk to each other. Our children play together outside. It is a nice change from the busy world. It feels like the past. We live near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and fluffy. But sometimes we have problems with big storms. This season, we had many warnings for tornadoes. One night, we even heard sirens. We went to a safe place in our house. My little dog was with me. My big dog stayed outside and barked. The storm brought big hail. After the storm, the road was hot and wet. We went from hot to cool in a short time. The hail melted on the hot road. As the sun came out, it started to rain. We saw a beautiful rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. We stayed inside for a little while. Then, people started coming home. Life went back to normal. We cooked dinner and talked outside. I like this neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a small apartment with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. But each apartment is different inside. Some are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond, but it is not for swimming. I have seen deer and birds. In the morning, I hear a big frog singing. It is a nice place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to a boy who lives two houses down from me and another boy who lives on my street. They are not there anymore, but the memories are still with me. Many of the people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. The neighborhood has many two-story houses. When the weather is warm, I hear kids playing outside every weekend. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I never have problems with my neighbors. If I need help, they will help me. I have ordered packages online many times and never lost one. I trust my neighbors. There is a park just a minute from my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the other boys in the neighborhood. I also have a bad memory there - I got hit in the nose playing football. But the good memories are more than the bad. Now, I go to the park to play with my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time because it reminds me of my neighborhood.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food near my house. In a short walk, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Most people order food online now. There are many fast food places near my house. There are also many stores near my house. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. There is even an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I read about problems with neighbors on social media, I am happy to have good neighbors like mine.",
            "My town is a small place in South Carolina. It is like other towns in the area. But it is important for farmers. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town says on its sign. Many farms have peach trees or cattle. Houses are far apart. They are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles to keep out the sun. Most houses are not near the road. They are set back so people can use the land for animals and crops. In the main part of town, there is a traffic light. This is where people can buy food. There are three places to get fast food. They are Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. A pizza place used to be there, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town, but people usually go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food. Many people like to go to Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in town for a long time and has people who will deliver your furniture. Next to the furniture store is a place to groom pets. They can take care of your pet while you are away. There is a doctor and a veterinarian in town, but they are not very big. There is a small school called Johnston Elementary. Students go to school there until they are in fifth grade. Then they go to school in another town. There are no parks in town, but they are building a small park. It will be 2.5 acres and people can go there to have fun. There are not many things to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice town.",
            "I heard a story about my place on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. My apartment costs more than a thousand dollars a month. I had not heard this story before. Neither had my friends. Perhaps it is the struggle. Some of my friends are sad every night. Life is expensive. But we know how to save money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. We like the smell of old magazines. It stays on old furniture even after we clean it. There are three second-hand stores near my home. I can walk there. I can visit two stores that help people, a place to borrow books, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are busy. Cars and people move every morning. But the stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Many people visit every year. The city is growing. A big company is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy. People do not ask for help. I can be alone and quiet. People do not bother me. It is not like the South. People care about each other in the South. Here, people do not ask about each other's lives. I can be myself. The city is lively. I hear music next door and people singing upstairs. We are not just strangers. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. We help each other when we need it. I am lucky to live here. I like my neighbors. They are kind to me. I clean after myself. They do the same. We share food and mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern building. But my neighbors make me feel at home.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is part of a community with a homeowner's association. This means everything looks the same. The houses are well-maintained and single-family homes. They have small yards with grass, some pebbles, and short driveways. Some houses are one-story, but some are two-story. \n\nThe streets are always in good shape. You will not see potholes or broken roads. We have many families living here, but everyone takes care of their homes. You will not see individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get to your mailbox. There are also big lockers for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. We have a lot of land, which is good for many things. There are community pools that everyone can use. They are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking trails where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can run around the neighborhood to get exercise.\n\nMost people who live here are old, but we also have some middle-aged and young people. It is a safe area, and people take care of each other. We have a small city nearby. It is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need, like a shopping mall. It is not very big, but it has everything we need. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to the mall. There are many stores to choose from. We have good food stores and cheap stores. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and trails. It is easy to get to the city and all its stores.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city but not in it. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. Many people in this area have low incomes. They rent or own homes here. The houses are not expensive. The neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates are higher here than in other parts of the town. There have been some violent crimes near my home. For example, there were shootings and one person died. But we have not been hurt. Sometimes things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. I am lucky my family has not been hurt by crime.\n\nThe town I live in has a big problem. Many people here have died from taking too much of a strong drug called fentanyl. There are places in town to help people with addiction. They have centers to help people get better and teach others how to help too. We have a lot of good things in our town. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and workers are kind. My son has special needs, but he is happy and safe at school. The school has a group that helps parents and makes events to get families involved. They give free food to all students. No one goes hungry because they cannot pay. The town council is working to make our town look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But they have mainly done this in the center of town and on the other side where there are stores. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have everything we need. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is located on a hill. Many famous buildings are here. I live in a 7-story building near a historic theater. A short walk away is a small bar where people like to go in the summer. It is very popular. Some people wait in line to get in. Near my house is a big park. It is nice for people who live in the city. The park is fenced in and has many stairs. In the winter, some people who do not have a home sleep here. They set up tents and stay together for safety and warmth. This is better than sleeping alone.\n\nI like my city. It is not just the old buildings that are special. The people are also special. This neighborhood was once very bad. There were many gangs and violence. But the people here work hard to keep it safe. They take care of their city. They remember the past, but they are not afraid. They want people to know they are kind and caring.\n\nSome people say it is not safe to walk around at night. But I think this is not true. The people here are friendly. They are kind to me. They help me when I need it. I feel safe walking around at night. I like it here. No matter where I go, this will always be my home. The people here are like a family to me. They make me feel welcome and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a country place. People live in houses on the land. They have big yards. Most houses are old. Some are new. They are not the same. They are different. Many houses have basements. You can see them from the street. They have old aluminum siding. The houses are different colors. Some people have animals. They have yards with swings and playsets. The town is like America. People work to make money. They have families. On the street, you see children playing. You see people walking dogs and riding bikes. People know their neighbors. They are friendly. They say hello. The lawns are nice. The grass is cut. The flowers are trimmed. It is a quiet and safe place. People want to live here. It is near the police station and the hospital. People can recycle here. There is a park where children play sports. There are baseball and softball fields. You can also hear airplanes flying in and out of the small airport. You can walk to get ice cream or go to the store. My children can ride their bikes to the park. It is a nice place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood is interesting. It has single family houses. But some homes are divided into two parts, while still connected. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the side. It is like the other houses. They look like they are from a long time ago. Back then, living in the suburbs was a popular choice for Americans. But now it is not as popular. My neighborhood still looks nice. It reminds people that the idea of a perfect life is still possible. The people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not well taken care of. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside as if nothing is wrong. The public school has been there for almost 90 years. It still looks strong. The churches are few and are not used much. But the basketball courts are still popular. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called \"A\" Supermarket. It is owned by a family from Yemen. They are probably the only family from Yemen in the neighborhood. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Children play football until cars come by. Most people have lived here for a long time. They know everyone. There was a karate school, but it closed when kids stopped wanting to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Most people do not like it because it does not have new movies. But older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is a highway that goes through our town, but it only goes through the town next to us. Some people wanted to make an exit in our town, but others did not. They thought it would ruin the town.

My home is in a small group of houses. They are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a lot of land, over half an acre. Everyone takes care of their yard. In the spring, people plant flowers. The trees change with the seasons. The driveways have big, luxury cars. They shine in the sun after they are washed. My neighbor was mowing his lawn. He was singing a happy song. My friend and I laughed. He is a kind person with an interesting past. He used to be a doctor. He is older now and a little slower. He still mows his lawn every day.\n\nAs we kept driving, we reached my house. There were many geese in the yard. Our dog was chasing them. Behind the house, there was a small stream. The sound of the stream and the frogs was loud. Sometimes we could hear cows from the farms nearby. Across a small bridge made of wood, there was a quiet place. There were many trees, herbs, and wildflowers. That was where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and chased animals. I had friends in the neighborhood. In the winter, the town could be very cold. But it was also very beautiful. The trees were empty and the flowers were gone. Sometimes it snowed and a winter wonderland appeared. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot when we were kids. But in the winter, we just played and had fun.",
            "Portland, Oregon is an interesting city. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This means that people in Portland like to do things their own way. They like to be different. Some people remember the city as it was in the 1990s and early 2000s. It was less well-known and less expensive. The city had many creative and unique cultures.\n\nToday, many people from California are moving to Portland. They are building new homes and businesses. But Portland is still weird. Weird means accepting of things that are not normal. People in Portland do not always judge others for being different. They have yoga and hipsters and business people like other cities. But in Portland, they just do not take things as seriously.\n\nMy neighborhood is colorful. There are beautiful homes, gardens with flowers and herbs, and free boxes on the sidewalk in the summer. Free boxes are boxes with things that people are giving away. They can have clothes, books, or anything else. Walking through my neighborhood is fun. You might find something interesting.\n\nPortland is full of people who love many things. Some people go to goat yoga. Others like to watch the city's soccer team. Portland has a drug problem. It is caused by mental health issues. The rain and cloudy weather may also be a problem. The city also has a homelessness problem. Many people come to Portland because it has good social services. But the services are not enough.\n\nPeople in Portland are not strange about this problem. They are confused. They do not know what to do. Some people care about the homeless, but others do not. This is like other cities in the United States.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They watch the sun every day. The sun rises and sets in front of them. The mountains do not change. They are steady and strong. They do not care about our problems. But when we are sad or stressed, they call to us. We look at them and feel better. They give us strength to keep going.\n\nI first saw the mountains when I was in college. They are near the university. The campus is nice, but the mountains are special. There are many beautiful things on campus, like buildings and ponds and trees. But the mountains are the most beautiful. The rest of the town is nice too. There are many coffee shops where I studied for long time. You can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and interesting. The buildings are old and colorful.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. It is busy and fun in the downtown area. But you can also be quiet and peaceful in the small town. The library is a quiet place. You can go there to think and relax. This town has a special feeling. It invites you to explore it. I made many happy memories in this town. I walked with my friends through the park at night. We went to the movie theater and watched a movie. But I also made sad memories. We all make memories, both good and bad. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I have cried there many times.\n\nI walked near the pond and the park and the houses. I saw the sun shining on the palm trees. The sky was beautiful. I looked up and saw the mountains. They were strong and steady. They reminded me to be strong too. They told me to keep going.",
            "Bensonhurt is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. If you visit, you will not have trouble finding it. The public transportation is good. Many people use it. Bensonhurt is a busy place. You will still feel like you are in New York City. When you walk around, you will see many Asian stores. Many people from Asia live here. Over the past twenty years, the number of Asian people in Bensonhurt has increased. As a result, you will see one Asian store every few blocks. Many people like the Asian stores because they are good, cheap, and convenient. I live nearby. There are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This makes it easy to buy food.\n\nBensonhurt is not just Asian people. It is a mix of people from many countries. Immigrants and their children live here. Most of the big businesses are owned by Asians. There is also a park nearby. It has many things for people to do. There are basketball courts, a big field, handball courts, and a playground for children. In the summer, children can play with water.\n\nThe buildings in Bensonhurt are not very tall. Most people live in small houses or apartments. The people here are nice, but it can be noisy. You will hear cars with loud music and people driving fast. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurt is usually safe, but some people can be mean. I was once hurt here, but it was a long time ago. Recently, some people stole packages from houses. People also do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the ground every morning. Keep your shoes clean when you walk around.",
            "I live in a place where there are few sidewalks. A big hill is near my house. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many people like to run up it. The road I live on is not good for driving. There are many holes in it. Everyone walks on the road because there are no sidewalks. The telephone and electric wires around our block are old and broken. It rains a lot where I live. The wind and rain break the wires and cause problems. We have to repair them often.\n\nThere are many big trees in my area. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to look at the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset when the water is lit from below and the sky is orange. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on many things: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car alone for a month, and when I got back, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near my house. But most people in my area are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs like to run in people's yards or down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nWe also have rabbits in our area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see many birds: small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles fly by. The neighborhood crows chase them away. We do not have stores nearby, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The bay is not very wide, but you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a typical neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. The town is between two state highways. We have some traffic on our street, but it is mostly quiet. Few people move in and out of the neighborhood, so I know most of the people who live here. They like to take care of their lawns and do other daily tasks. In the winter, we sled down a hill on the side street. Our house is at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going. We pay attention to any strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and play. We are home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us: my wife and two daughters (eleven and fourteen years old). So, everyone is used to us coming and going. We go outside and play, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck and it smells nice. We can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. We have many trees, so it is shady. We have to rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. It is a sign that fall has arrived. We do not have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. I like to work in my garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. It is quiet on holidays. Thanksgiving and other holidays have extra cars because people visit from out of town. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the high desert. It is a very dry place with much dirt. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like to see brown everywhere. When I first moved here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now, there are many more houses. My neighborhood is becoming more like a city. But this is true of many places.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are friendly. However, like many cities, it has good and bad parts. I live near many older people. They are kind. In my neighborhood, there are many stores with chains, such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want organic food, you must go to a different place. \n\nThe main jobs in my city are in construction. This is because my city is still growing and there is much space to build. I am worried about this. I do not want my city to change too much. I came from a big city and do not want to go back.\n\nMy job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bar. What I like about my home is the animals. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has many plants and animals that need protecting. It is good to learn about these animals so we can live together safely. My family and I like the animals. My three children like to catch lizards and bugs.\n\nWe have some fun things to do in my city. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. You can see the snow-covered mountains and take lessons to learn how to ski. If you like history and nature, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many things to show you about the desert and the people who live here.",
            "I live in a special kind of neighborhood. It is not like other neighborhoods. I live on a college campus. My dormitory is my community. I also consider the campus around me my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses where I live. First, there are apartments. Each apartment has four rooms. Twenty people live in each building. Second, there are houses that people rent. These houses have two or four bedrooms. Not many people live in these houses. Finally, there are rooms in the dormitory where two people live. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nPeople from many countries and ages live in my neighborhood. The school is proud of its diversity. Most of the staff live in the houses. New students live in the dormitory. Older students live in the apartments.\n\nLet's talk about the stores. My school is a closed community. It has many stores. There are places to buy food, clothes and other things. All the things people need are in the neighborhood.\n\nThere is a park in my neighborhood. It is a good place for people to play. The park is clean and safe. All the people in my neighborhood help keep it that way.",
            "I live in my neighborhood for 10 years. I was sad when I first moved here. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and friends. But my mom and dad said this was a better place for us. We have a good house and a good school. It was not a bad neighborhood.\n\nOver time, I got used to it. I made some new friends. I also made some enemies in school. I did not know my neighbors very well. But Mr. Glen and his family were nice. They lived next to us. I also knew Dennis a little bit.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I danced with his daughter, Marsharii. I hope she is doing well. My mom and dad and my sister also went to the wedding. We all had a good time.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. But I have a GPS now. I can explore it more. I like to play video games with my friends Kason and Curtis. We have fun together. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm.\n\nI like to practice my balance with sticks. I also like to play with my bokken wooden sword. There are a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. They made us practice hard. But we had fun.\n\nI have had some good times in this neighborhood. I have a lot of memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. This is good for me. I like it. There are many apartment buildings in my neighborhood. Some restaurants and bars are also near me. These places are fun to visit and not very expensive. One of the bars was recently renamed. It costs more money to go there, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people in my neighborhood are nice. They are either college students or they do not have a lot of money. The apartments are not very expensive. There is a school near me for young children. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My landlord put a machine in their apartment to make the air smell good. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It feels insulting. The buildings around me are old and may need repair. A little ways down the street are new apartments. I do not like them. They are not well built, but the rent is high. I think this is unfair. They are close to the college, so the landlords can charge a lot of money. There is a cheap restaurant near me that serves food on paper plates. Most of the food is heated in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is a bad place to work. The city gave some money to fix the road near my apartment. Now the sidewalk is big and nice, and there are many trees and grass. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. Some of these trees were cut down, but there are many still left. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street. The street behind me is 43rd street. This street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they may be hiding the condition of the buildings. Many crimes have happened at an apartment complex on this street. But I do not blame them. There are also apartments across from me with problems. But I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many useful things near me. I like being close to the university and the two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses on a special street. The houses are close to each other and look like small towns. They have yellow paint and white porches. Almost everyone knows each other. We often stand at the end of our driveways and talk to each other. Our children play together outside. It is a nice change from the busy world. It feels like the past. We live near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and fluffy. But sometimes we have problems with big storms. This season, we had many warnings for tornadoes. One night, we even heard sirens. We went to a safe place in our house. My little dog was with me. My big dog stayed outside and barked. The storm brought big hail. After the storm, the road was hot and wet. We went from hot to cool in a short time. The hail melted on the hot road. As the sun came out, it started to rain. We saw a beautiful rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. We stayed inside for a little while. Then, people started coming home. Life went back to normal. We cooked dinner and talked outside. I like this neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a small apartment with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. But each apartment is different inside. Some are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond, but it is not for swimming. I have seen deer and birds. In the morning, I hear a big frog singing. It is a nice place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to a boy who lives two houses down from me and another boy who lives on my street. They are not there anymore, but the memories are still with me. Many of the people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. The neighborhood has many two-story houses. When the weather is warm, I hear kids playing outside every weekend. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I never have problems with my neighbors. If I need help, they will help me. I have ordered packages online many times and never lost one. I trust my neighbors. There is a park just a minute from my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the other boys in the neighborhood. I also have a bad memory there - I got hit in the nose playing football. But the good memories are more than the bad. Now, I go to the park to play with my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time because it reminds me of my neighborhood.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food near my house. In a short walk, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Most people order food online now. There are many fast food places near my house. There are also many stores near my house. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. There is even an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I read about problems with neighbors on social media, I am happy to have good neighbors like mine.",
            "My town is a small place in South Carolina. It is like other towns in the area. But it is important for farmers. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town says on its sign. Many farms have peach trees or cattle. Houses are far apart. They are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles to keep out the sun. Most houses are not near the road. They are set back so people can use the land for animals and crops. In the main part of town, there is a traffic light. This is where people can buy food. There are three places to get fast food. They are Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. A pizza place used to be there, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town, but people usually go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food. Many people like to go to Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in town for a long time and has people who will deliver your furniture. Next to the furniture store is a place to groom pets. They can take care of your pet while you are away. There is a doctor and a veterinarian in town, but they are not very big. There is a small school called Johnston Elementary. Students go to school there until they are in fifth grade. Then they go to school in another town. There are no parks in town, but they are building a small park. It will be 2.5 acres and people can go there to have fun. There are not many things to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice town.",
            "I heard a story about my place on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. My apartment costs more than a thousand dollars a month. I had not heard this story before. Neither had my friends. Perhaps it is the struggle. Some of my friends are sad every night. Life is expensive. But we know how to save money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. We like the smell of old magazines. It stays on old furniture even after we clean it. There are three second-hand stores near my home. I can walk there. I can visit two stores that help people, a place to borrow books, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are busy. Cars and people move every morning. But the stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Many people visit every year. The city is growing. A big company is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy. People do not ask for help. I can be alone and quiet. People do not bother me. It is not like the South. People care about each other in the South. Here, people do not ask about each other's lives. I can be myself. The city is lively. I hear music next door and people singing upstairs. We are not just strangers. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. We help each other when we need it. I am lucky to live here. I like my neighbors. They are kind to me. I clean after myself. They do the same. We share food and mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern building. But my neighbors make me feel at home.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is part of a community with a homeowner's association. This means everything looks the same. The houses are well-maintained and single-family homes. They have small yards with grass, some pebbles, and short driveways. Some houses are one-story, but some are two-story. \n\nThe streets are always in good shape. You will not see potholes or broken roads. We have many families living here, but everyone takes care of their homes. You will not see individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get to your mailbox. There are also big lockers for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. We have a lot of land, which is good for many things. There are community pools that everyone can use. They are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking trails where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can run around the neighborhood to get exercise.\n\nMost people who live here are old, but we also have some middle-aged and young people. It is a safe area, and people take care of each other. We have a small city nearby. It is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need, like a shopping mall. It is not very big, but it has everything we need. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to the mall. There are many stores to choose from. We have good food stores and cheap stores. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and trails. It is easy to get to the city and all its stores.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city but not in it. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. Many people in this area have low incomes. They rent or own homes here. The houses are not expensive. The neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates are higher here than in other parts of the town. There have been some violent crimes near my home. For example, there were shootings and one person died. But we have not been hurt. Sometimes things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. I am lucky my family has not been hurt by crime.\n\nThe town I live in has a big problem. Many people here have died from taking too much of a strong drug called fentanyl. There are places in town to help people with addiction. They have centers to help people get better and teach others how to help too. We have a lot of good things in our town. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and workers are kind. My son has special needs, but he is happy and safe at school. The school has a group that helps parents and makes events to get families involved. They give free food to all students. No one goes hungry because they cannot pay. The town council is working to make our town look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But they have mainly done this in the center of town and on the other side where there are stores. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have everything we need. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is located on a hill. Many famous buildings are here. I live in a 7-story building near a historic theater. A short walk away is a small bar where people like to go in the summer. It is very popular. Some people wait in line to get in. Near my house is a big park. It is nice for people who live in the city. The park is fenced in and has many stairs. In the winter, some people who do not have a home sleep here. They set up tents and stay together for safety and warmth. This is better than sleeping alone.\n\nI like my city. It is not just the old buildings that are special. The people are also special. This neighborhood was once very bad. There were many gangs and violence. But the people here work hard to keep it safe. They take care of their city. They remember the past, but they are not afraid. They want people to know they are kind and caring.\n\nSome people say it is not safe to walk around at night. But I think this is not true. The people here are friendly. They are kind to me. They help me when I need it. I feel safe walking around at night. I like it here. No matter where I go, this will always be my home. The people here are like a family to me. They make me feel welcome and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a country place. People live in houses on the land. They have big yards. Most houses are old. Some are new. They are not the same. They are different. Many houses have basements. You can see them from the street. They have old aluminum siding. The houses are different colors. Some people have animals. They have yards with swings and playsets. The town is like America. People work to make money. They have families. On the street, you see children playing. You see people walking dogs and riding bikes. People know their neighbors. They are friendly. They say hello. The lawns are nice. The grass is cut. The flowers are trimmed. It is a quiet and safe place. People want to live here. It is near the police station and the hospital. People can recycle here. There is a park where children play sports. There are baseball and softball fields. You can also hear airplanes flying in and out of the small airport. You can walk to get ice cream or go to the store. My children can ride their bikes to the park. It is a nice place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood is interesting. It has single family houses. But some homes are divided into two parts, while still connected. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the side. It is like the other houses. They look like they are from a long time ago. Back then, living in the suburbs was a popular choice for Americans. But now it is not as popular. My neighborhood still looks nice. It reminds people that the idea of a perfect life is still possible. The people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not well taken care of. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside as if nothing is wrong. The public school has been there for almost 90 years. It still looks strong. The churches are few and are not used much. But the basketball courts are still popular. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called \"A\" Supermarket. It is owned by a family from Yemen. They are probably the only family from Yemen in the neighborhood. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Children play football until cars come by. Most people have lived here for a long time. They know everyone. There was a karate school, but it closed when kids stopped wanting to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Most people do not like it because it does not have new movies. But older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is a highway that goes through our town, but it only goes through the town next to us. Some people wanted to make an exit in our town, but others did not. They thought it would ruin the town. Now we are building a new school. We need to choose a symbol for our town. I think a robot with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good choice.",

But if you go behind the old, abandoned store and walk back behind the hotels, you will find a busy community. There are many apartment buildings here. They are next to each other like a series of small boxes.\n\nSome of these buildings have problems. We will not talk about those. But the other buildings are very different. They are near a small college. The college has a quiet campus where students go to learn. They often go there early in the morning with coffee in their hands.\n\nThe college is near a road.

Old people walk their dogs on a path in the park. They see the young people on skateboards and the girls talking by the swings. There is a store near the park where you can buy cheap food. There is also a store where you can buy things for your pool. You can even get a manicure and eat while you are there. There is a store with frozen yogurt too. The young people like to buy yogurt and eat it while they are on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a special place. It is a part of American life. It is a place where people live and do things. It is a place that does not change much.",
            "We drove past many corn fields. They went on forever. My friend was surprised by the empty space. She lived in a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home. She had never seen so much open space before. I told her what it was like growing up in a small town in Ohio. After that, she understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a two-lane road. There was a big hole in the ground filled with water. Just past it was where I live. My home is in a small group of houses. They are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a lot of land, over half an acre. Everyone takes care of their yard. In the spring, people plant flowers. The trees change with the seasons. The driveways have big, luxury cars. They shine in the sun after they are washed. My neighbor was mowing his lawn. He was singing a happy song. My friend and I laughed. He is a kind person with an interesting past. He used to be a doctor. He is older now and a little slower. He still mows his lawn every day.\n\nAs we kept driving, we reached my house. There were many geese in the yard. Our dog was chasing them. Behind the house, there was a small stream. The sound of the stream and the frogs was loud. Sometimes we could hear cows from the farms nearby. Across a small bridge made of wood, there was a quiet place. There were many trees, herbs, and wildflowers. That was where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and chased animals. I had friends in the neighborhood. In the winter, the town could be very cold. But it was also very beautiful. The trees were empty and the flowers were gone. Sometimes it snowed and a winter wonderland appeared. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot when we were kids. But in the winter, we just played and had fun.",
            "Portland, Oregon is an interesting city. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This means that people in Portland like to do things their own way. They like to be different. Some people remember the city as it was in the 1990s and early 2000s. It was less well-known and less expensive. The city had many creative and unique cultures.\n\nToday, many people from California are moving to Portland. They are building new homes and businesses. But Portland is still weird. Weird means accepting of things that are not normal. People in Portland do not always judge others for being different. They have yoga and hipsters and business people like other cities. But in Portland, they just do not take things as seriously.\n\nMy neighborhood is colorful. There are beautiful homes, gardens with flowers and herbs, and free boxes on the sidewalk in the summer. Free boxes are boxes with things that people are giving away. They can have clothes, books, or anything else. Walking through my neighborhood is fun. You might find something interesting.\n\nPortland is full of people who love many things. Some people go to goat yoga. Others like to watch the city's soccer team. Portland has a drug problem. It is caused by mental health issues. The rain and cloudy weather may also be a problem. The city also has a homelessness problem. Many people come to Portland because it has good social services. But the services are not enough.\n\nPeople in Portland are not strange about this problem. They are confused. They do not know what to do. Some people care about the homeless, but others do not. This is like other cities in the United States.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They watch the sun every day. The sun rises and sets in front of them. The mountains do not change. They are steady and strong. They do not care about our problems. But when we are sad or stressed, they call to us. We look at them and feel better. They give us strength to keep going.\n\nI first saw the mountains when I was in college. They are near the university. The campus is nice, but the mountains are special. There are many beautiful things on campus, like buildings and ponds and trees. But the mountains are the most beautiful. The rest of the town is nice too. There are many coffee shops where I studied for long time. You can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and interesting. The buildings are old and colorful.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. It is busy and fun in the downtown area. But you can also be quiet and peaceful in the small town. The library is a quiet place. You can go there to think and relax. This town has a special feeling. It invites you to explore it. I made many happy memories in this town. I walked with my friends through the park at night. We went to the movie theater and watched a movie. But I also made sad memories. We all make memories, both good and bad. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I have cried there many times.\n\nI walked near the pond and the park and the houses. I saw the sun shining on the palm trees. The sky was beautiful. I looked up and saw the mountains. They were strong and steady. They reminded me to be strong too. They told me to keep going.",
            "Bensonhurt is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. If you visit, you will not have trouble finding it. The public transportation is good. Many people use it. Bensonhurt is a busy place. You will still feel like you are in New York City. When you walk around, you will see many Asian stores. Many people from Asia live here. Over the past twenty years, the number of Asian people in Bensonhurt has increased. As a result, you will see one Asian store every few blocks. Many people like the Asian stores because they are good, cheap, and convenient. I live nearby. There are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This makes it easy to buy food.\n\nBensonhurt is not just Asian people. It is a mix of people from many countries. Immigrants and their children live here. Most of the big businesses are owned by Asians. There is also a park nearby. It has many things for people to do. There are basketball courts, a big field, handball courts, and a playground for children. In the summer, children can play with water.\n\nThe buildings in Bensonhurt are not very tall. Most people live in small houses or apartments. The people here are nice, but it can be noisy. You will hear cars with loud music and people driving fast. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurt is usually safe, but some people can be mean. I was once hurt here, but it was a long time ago. Recently, some people stole packages from houses. People also do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the ground every morning. Keep your shoes clean when you walk around.",
            "I live in a place where there are few sidewalks. A big hill is near my house. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many people like to run up it. The road I live on is not good for driving. There are many holes in it. Everyone walks on the road because there are no sidewalks. The telephone and electric wires around our block are old and broken. It rains a lot where I live. The wind and rain break the wires and cause problems. We have to repair them often.\n\nThere are many big trees in my area. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to look at the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset when the water is lit from below and the sky is orange. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on many things: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car alone for a month, and when I got back, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near my house. But most people in my area are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs like to run in people's yards or down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nWe also have rabbits in our area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see many birds: small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles fly by. The neighborhood crows chase them away. We do not have stores nearby, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The bay is not very wide, but you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a typical neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. The town is between two state highways. We have some traffic on our street, but it is mostly quiet. Few people move in and out of the neighborhood, so I know most of the people who live here. They like to take care of their lawns and do other daily tasks. In the winter, we sled down a hill on the side street. Our house is at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going. We pay attention to any strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and play. We are home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us: my wife and two daughters (eleven and fourteen years old). So, everyone is used to us coming and going. We go outside and play, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck and it smells nice. We can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. We have many trees, so it is shady. We have to rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. It is a sign that fall has arrived. We do not have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. I like to work in my garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. It is quiet on holidays. Thanksgiving and other holidays have extra cars because people visit from out of town. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the high desert. It is a very dry place with much dirt. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like to see brown everywhere. When I first moved here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now, there are many more houses. My neighborhood is becoming more like a city. But this is true of many places.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are friendly. However, like many cities, it has good and bad parts. I live near many older people. They are kind. In my neighborhood, there are many stores with chains, such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want organic food, you must go to a different place. \n\nThe main jobs in my city are in construction. This is because my city is still growing and there is much space to build. I am worried about this. I do not want my city to change too much. I came from a big city and do not want to go back.\n\nMy job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bar. What I like about my home is the animals. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has many plants and animals that need protecting. It is good to learn about these animals so we can live together safely. My family and I like the animals. My three children like to catch lizards and bugs.\n\nWe have some fun things to do in my city. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. You can see the snow-covered mountains and take lessons to learn how to ski. If you like history and nature, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many things to show you about the desert and the people who live here.",
            "I live in a special kind of neighborhood. It is not like other neighborhoods. I live on a college campus. My dormitory is my community. I also consider the campus around me my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses where I live. First, there are apartments. Each apartment has four rooms. Twenty people live in each building. Second, there are houses that people rent. These houses have two or four bedrooms. Not many people live in these houses. Finally, there are rooms in the dormitory where two people live. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nPeople from many countries and ages live in my neighborhood. The school is proud of its diversity. Most of the staff live in the houses. New students live in the dormitory. Older students live in the apartments.\n\nLet's talk about the stores. My school is a closed community. It has many stores. There are places to buy food, clothes and other things. All the things people need are in the neighborhood.\n\nThere is a park in my neighborhood. It is a good place for people to play. The park is clean and safe. All the people in my neighborhood help keep it that way.",
            "I live in my neighborhood for 10 years. I was sad when I first moved here. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and friends. But my mom and dad said this was a better place for us. We have a good house and a good school. It was not a bad neighborhood.\n\nOver time, I got used to it. I made some new friends. I also made some enemies in school. I did not know my neighbors very well. But Mr. Glen and his family were nice. They lived next to us. I also knew Dennis a little bit.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I danced with his daughter, Marsharii. I hope she is doing well. My mom and dad and my sister also went to the wedding. We all had a good time.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. But I have a GPS now. I can explore it more. I like to play video games with my friends Kason and Curtis. We have fun together. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm.\n\nI like to practice my balance with sticks. I also like to play with my bokken wooden sword. There are a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. They made us practice hard. But we had fun.\n\nI have had some good times in this neighborhood. I have a lot of memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. This is good for me. I like it. There are many apartment buildings in my neighborhood. Some restaurants and bars are also near me. These places are fun to visit and not very expensive. One of the bars was recently renamed. It costs more money to go there, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people in my neighborhood are nice. They are either college students or they do not have a lot of money. The apartments are not very expensive. There is a school near me for young children. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My landlord put a machine in their apartment to make the air smell good. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It feels insulting. The buildings around me are old and may need repair. A little ways down the street are new apartments. I do not like them. They are not well built, but the rent is high. I think this is unfair. They are close to the college, so the landlords can charge a lot of money. There is a cheap restaurant near me that serves food on paper plates. Most of the food is heated in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is a bad place to work. The city gave some money to fix the road near my apartment. Now the sidewalk is big and nice, and there are many trees and grass. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. Some of these trees were cut down, but there are many still left. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street. The street behind me is 43rd street. This street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they may be hiding the condition of the buildings. Many crimes have happened at an apartment complex on this street. But I do not blame them. There are also apartments across from me with problems. But I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many useful things near me. I like being close to the university and the two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses on a special street. The houses are close to each other and look like small towns. They have yellow paint and white porches. Almost everyone knows each other. We often stand at the end of our driveways and talk to each other. Our children play together outside. It is a nice change from the busy world. It feels like the past. We live near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and fluffy. But sometimes we have problems with big storms. This season, we had many warnings for tornadoes. One night, we even heard sirens. We went to a safe place in our house. My little dog was with me. My big dog stayed outside and barked. The storm brought big hail. After the storm, the road was hot and wet. We went from hot to cool in a short time. The hail melted on the hot road. As the sun came out, it started to rain. We saw a beautiful rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. We stayed inside for a little while. Then, people started coming home. Life went back to normal. We cooked dinner and talked outside. I like this neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a small apartment with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. But each apartment is different inside. Some are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond, but it is not for swimming. I have seen deer and birds. In the morning, I hear a big frog singing. It is a nice place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to a boy who lives two houses down from me and another boy who lives on my street. They are not there anymore, but the memories are still with me. Many of the people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. The neighborhood has many two-story houses. When the weather is warm, I hear kids playing outside every weekend. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I never have problems with my neighbors. If I need help, they will help me. I have ordered packages online many times and never lost one. I trust my neighbors. There is a park just a minute from my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the other boys in the neighborhood. I also have a bad memory there - I got hit in the nose playing football. But the good memories are more than the bad. Now, I go to the park to play with my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time because it reminds me of my neighborhood.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food near my house. In a short walk, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Most people order food online now. There are many fast food places near my house. There are also many stores near my house. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. There is even an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I read about problems with neighbors on social media, I am happy to have good neighbors like mine.",
            "My town is a small place in South Carolina. It is like other towns in the area. But it is important for farmers. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town says on its sign. Many farms have peach trees or cattle. Houses are far apart. They are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles to keep out the sun. Most houses are not near the road. They are set back so people can use the land for animals and crops. In the main part of town, there is a traffic light. This is where people can buy food. There are three places to get fast food. They are Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. A pizza place used to be there, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town, but people usually go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food. Many people like to go to Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in town for a long time and has people who will deliver your furniture. Next to the furniture store is a place to groom pets. They can take care of your pet while you are away. There is a doctor and a veterinarian in town, but they are not very big. There is a small school called Johnston Elementary. Students go to school there until they are in fifth grade. Then they go to school in another town. There are no parks in town, but they are building a small park. It will be 2.5 acres and people can go there to have fun. There are not many things to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice town.",
            "I heard a story about my place on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. My apartment costs more than a thousand dollars a month. I had not heard this story before. Neither had my friends. Perhaps it is the struggle. Some of my friends are sad every night. Life is expensive. But we know how to save money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. We like the smell of old magazines. It stays on old furniture even after we clean it. There are three second-hand stores near my home. I can walk there. I can visit two stores that help people, a place to borrow books, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are busy. Cars and people move every morning. But the stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Many people visit every year. The city is growing. A big company is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy. People do not ask for help. I can be alone and quiet. People do not bother me. It is not like the South. People care about each other in the South. Here, people do not ask about each other's lives. I can be myself. The city is lively. I hear music next door and people singing upstairs. We are not just strangers. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. We help each other when we need it. I am lucky to live here. I like my neighbors. They are kind to me. I clean after myself. They do the same. We share food and mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern building. But my neighbors make me feel at home.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is part of a community with a homeowner's association. This means everything looks the same. The houses are well-maintained and single-family homes. They have small yards with grass, some pebbles, and short driveways. Some houses are one-story, but some are two-story. \n\nThe streets are always in good shape. You will not see potholes or broken roads. We have many families living here, but everyone takes care of their homes. You will not see individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get to your mailbox. There are also big lockers for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. We have a lot of land, which is good for many things. There are community pools that everyone can use. They are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking trails where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can run around the neighborhood to get exercise.\n\nMost people who live here are old, but we also have some middle-aged and young people. It is a safe area, and people take care of each other. We have a small city nearby. It is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need, like a shopping mall. It is not very big, but it has everything we need. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to the mall. There are many stores to choose from. We have good food stores and cheap stores. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and trails. It is easy to get to the city and all its stores.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city but not in it. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. Many people in this area have low incomes. They rent or own homes here. The houses are not expensive. The neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates are higher here than in other parts of the town. There have been some violent crimes near my home. For example, there were shootings and one person died. But we have not been hurt. Sometimes things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. I am lucky my family has not been hurt by crime.\n\nThe town I live in has a big problem. Many people here have died from taking too much of a strong drug called fentanyl. There are places in town to help people with addiction. They have centers to help people get better and teach others how to help too. We have a lot of good things in our town. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and workers are kind. My son has special needs, but he is happy and safe at school. The school has a group that helps parents and makes events to get families involved. They give free food to all students. No one goes hungry because they cannot pay. The town council is working to make our town look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But they have mainly done this in the center of town and on the other side where there are stores. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have everything we need. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is located on a hill. Many famous buildings are here. I live in a 7-story building near a historic theater. A short walk away is a small bar where people like to go in the summer. It is very popular. Some people wait in line to get in. Near my house is a big park. It is nice for people who live in the city. The park is fenced in and has many stairs. In the winter, some people who do not have a home sleep here. They set up tents and stay together for safety and warmth. This is better than sleeping alone.\n\nI like my city. It is not just the old buildings that are special. The people are also special. This neighborhood was once very bad. There were many gangs and violence. But the people here work hard to keep it safe. They take care of their city. They remember the past, but they are not afraid. They want people to know they are kind and caring.\n\nSome people say it is not safe to walk around at night. But I think this is not true. The people here are friendly. They are kind to me. They help me when I need it. I feel safe walking around at night. I like it here. No matter where I go, this will always be my home. The people here are like a family to me. They make me feel welcome and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a country place. People live in houses on the land. They have big yards. Most houses are old. Some are new. They are not the same. They are different. Many houses have basements. You can see them from the street. They have old aluminum siding. The houses are different colors. Some people have animals. They have yards with swings and playsets. The town is like America. People work to make money. They have families. On the street, you see children playing. You see people walking dogs and riding bikes. People know their neighbors. They are friendly. They say hello. The lawns are nice. The grass is cut. The flowers are trimmed. It is a quiet and safe place. People want to live here. It is near the police station and the hospital. People can recycle here. There is a park where children play sports. There are baseball and softball fields. You can also hear airplanes flying in and out of the small airport. You can walk to get ice cream or go to the store. My children can ride their bikes to the park. It is a nice place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My home is in a big city. The city is very different from one place to another. One place can be a home for people, and the next place can be a store or a restaurant. There are many stores and restaurants. Some stores are big and famous. Others are small and new. Some people like to visit these stores. Some stores are in big buildings called malls. Others are on the street. The streets are not always quiet. They are near homes where people live.\n\nThere are also parks in the city. People like to visit these parks with their children. My city is home to many different kinds of people. In one place, there are many people from the LGBTQ+ community. There are also many Jewish people. And there are people from the Soviet Union.

These are just a few of the many communities.\n\nBut the city is very big. It takes a long time to get from one place to another. People do not like to walk. The city has very bad traffic. It is hard to find a place to park. The city is building more and more homes. Some people like this. Others do not. They do not want more people in the city. They do not want more cars on the road.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes in the city. Some people live in big buildings. Others live in small houses. Some houses are for one family. Others are for two families. This is true in my neighborhood. There are many different kinds of homes. There are people of all ages in my neighborhood. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not very close. But when I was a child, I played with my neighbors. We had fun together.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family homes. But some have been divided into two, connected to each other. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway to the left. It looks like a home from a long time ago. This was the American dream. But now things are different. The dream is not as strong as it was. My neighborhood still looks nice. But the people are not as happy. The yards are not as clean. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside. The public school is old. It has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks good. It makes the children think about their future. It makes the older people remember the past. There are a few churches, but they are not very full. The basketball courts are always busy. All the houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a family from Yemen. They are the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people are African American. The streets are wide and the children play football. They stop playing to let the cars pass. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for a long time. They know each other's families. There used to be a karate school. But it closed when people stopped watching karate movies. Now it is a pharmacy. People think medicine can solve any problem. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a low price. The children do not like it. But the older people do. They think it is a good way to have fun. There is a highway that goes through our town. But it does not come into our town. We tried to get an entrance, but the older people did not want it. They said it would ruin our town. The town is building a new school. We are choosing a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good choice.",
            "You might not see it at first glance. This area is behind a shopping strip. It does not look like a place where people live. But if you go behind the old, empty store called Whole Foods, you can find a community. You have to walk behind the hotels that are empty most of the time.\n\nThese hotels are only used sometimes. They are for family reunions in the summer. There are many apartment buildings in this community. They are next to each other. They look like they were built to be together.\n\nThe first apartments you see have had bad things happen there. We will not talk about them too much. Appearances can be deceiving. But the other buildings are a different story. Almost nobody in this area knows about them.\n\nAcross from these buildings is a college. It is a small part of a bigger college. Students go there. They drink coffee and wake up early in the morning. The gates of the college open slowly to let them in. The students go to class. People driving by get angry because the students are holding up traffic.\n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park on one side and a place where people go to get better after they break a bone. The people who run this place have nice chairs outside. They have a fan that moves the air around. Children play in the park. They spin around and fall down in the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road.\n\nOld people walk their dogs. They look at the teenagers on skateboards and the girls talking about boys and YouTube. There is a place to eat sushi nearby. It is cheap, but it is not busy. There is also a store to buy things for the pool. You can get a haircut and food at the same time. There is a place to buy frozen yogurt too. Teenagers eat frozen yogurt and do tricks on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a part of America. It is a small piece of history in a quiet part of the south. Nothing much changes here. Even time seems to stand still.",
            "She looked out at the corn fields. \"Where are we?\" she asked. I said, \"This is it!\" I knew she would be surprised to see so much open space. She was from a town where the grocery store was close to her house. She had never seen so much open land before. I told her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio. She finally understood where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a two-lane road. We passed a quarry with water. Then we came to a small development where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard, and everyone takes care of them. In the spring, the yards have many flowers and trees. The driveways have nice cars like Mercedes-Benz. They shine in the sunlight after a car wash.\n\nI went to my house, a grey stucco house. My Korean neighbor was outside. He was happy to see me. He was always mowing his lawn and singing. People in the neighborhood liked him. He was a nice person with a special history. He was a doctor a long time ago. He is older now and not as funny. He uses a John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nMy house is near a stream. There are many geese and a Terrier. The stream goes into the quarry. You can hear the bullfrogs, the stream, and the cows from the nearby farms. Across the stream is a special place. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I played there a lot as a child. I built forts and chased animals. I had friends to play with. The winters were very cold, but they were beautiful. The trees were bare, and it snowed sometimes. We made snowmen and snow angels. My sister and I played together, even though we fought sometimes. We built forts to keep our snowballs safe. We played pretend in our own little world.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special place. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This means that people in Portland are not afraid to be different. They like things that are not normal. Portland was once a small, cheap city with its own unique culture. But now, many people from California are moving here, and the city is becoming more expensive. Still, Portland is weird in a good way. It means we accept things that others do not. We have all the modern things people want. We buy many things from China. But we also have a lot of things that are not modern. We have people who practice yoga, and people who like hipsters. We even have businesspeople. Maybe being weird just means we do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, the houses are colorful. The streets are lined with gardens full of flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In the summer, people put boxes on the street with things they no longer want. These boxes are called \"free boxes.\" They can have anything in them. Sometimes they have clothes and books. But they can have anything. Walking through my neighborhood is like a treasure hunt. You never know what you might find.\n\nPortland has many different kinds of people. Some people would never pick clothes out of a box on the street. They might go to yoga with goats or watch the city soccer team play. Portland is full of people who love many things. We are also full of people who want to achieve their dreams. But some people have mental health problems that make them turn to drugs. The rain and gray skies in Portland do not help. We also have a problem with homelessness. Many people come to Portland because we have good social services. But we do not have enough services to help everyone. The people who live here are not sure what to do about it. We are not weird when it comes to this problem.",
            "The mountains are always there. They stand in the north, watching the sun rise and set every day. I often forget they are there, but they do not change. They stand strong and still, no matter what happens in my life. When I am stressed and worried, the mountains call to me. When I look at them, I feel a little better. They give me strength to go on. \n\nI first saw the mountains when I started college. They are near the university where I study. The college has many beautiful buildings and a nice pond. But the mountains are special to me. They have a special place in my heart.\n\nThe rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafes where I study and drink coffee. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is an old part of town with old buildings. It is a fun place to be. But then I can walk to the library and be in a quiet place.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. One is busy and exciting. The other is quiet and peaceful. This makes the town interesting. I have many happy memories of my time here. I walk with my friends in the park or go to a movie in the college theater. But I also have sad memories. I have cried by the pond in the middle of the night when I was feeling unhappy.\n\nI like to walk by the pond and look at the turtles and ducks. They live their lives and do their jobs. This makes me think about my own life and what I want to do. I wonder if I have a purpose. I walk to the main street and look at the mountains. They are always there. They are strong and still. They make me feel strong and able to go on.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a hard time finding it. The neighborhood is easy to reach by public transportation. It is one of the most popular ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a busy area with many Asian stores. This is because many Asian people have moved to the area in the last twenty years. You will see an Asian store on almost every block as you walk. These stores often sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, the prices are low, and they are convenient. There are several Asian stores near where I live. In fact, I can walk to four stores in just a few minutes. This makes it easy to buy groceries. Bensonhurst is not all Asian people. It is a diverse area with people from different countries and their families. Many big stores in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby with a basketball court, a field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, a playground for kids, and a water fountain for kids to play in during the summer. The park is also a place where people from different backgrounds can play together. In Bensonhurst, you will not see many big buildings for companies. Most buildings are apartments for people who own them together, or houses. Many people live in two-family houses. The people in this area are generally nice, but they can be loud. Every day, you will hear loud music from cars driving by or people speeding. If you visit at night, be careful. While Bensonhurst is safe, you might meet people who want to cause trouble. I have had some problems with people in the past, but it was a long time ago. There is also a problem with people stealing packages. This is a common problem in many areas. Another problem is that people do not follow the rules about cleaning up after their dogs. Every morning, you will see dog waste on the sidewalk as you walk to the train or the store. My biggest complaint is the dog waste on the sidewalks everywhere I go. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I do not live on a street with many sidewalks. My house is at the top of the biggest hill in my neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many people like to run up it. There is no sidewalk on my street. So, everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good condition. In some places, it is pitted. This can be a problem for drivers. The telephone and electric wires around the block look old. They are often damaged in storms. We get many storms and rainfalls in my area. This causes branches to fall on the power lines. The repairs make the lines look old and broken.\n\nThere are many tall trees here. But people do not like them. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are high up on the hill. They have big windows on the top floor to see the ocean.\n\nThe view is beautiful at sunset. The water in the bay looks nice. The sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy. This makes the sunlight weak. Most days are overcast and damp.\n\nMoss grows on everything here, including roofs, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month. It got moss and looked funny. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school nearby. Most people are older and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs run around the neighborhood. They like to jump into yards or run in the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might get in. I once found a dog in my house. I had to chase it out.\n\nRabbits are common in my neighborhood. They are big and like to dig up plants and burrow into yards. My cats like to chase them. They have made most of the rabbits leave.\n\nWe have many birds here, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even through the mist.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My home is in a quiet neighborhood. It's a street between two big roads, so we see some cars all the time. But it's not too busy. Many people in the neighborhood are friendly. They take care of their yards. In the winter, we like to sled down a hill near our house. Our home is at the corner of the street, so we see everyone who comes and goes. When we see a strange car, we take notice.\n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and play. We like to go outside and play, even when it's raining. We have a big deck where we grill food. It smells good when we cook outside. We hear lawn mowers a lot from March to October. Our neighborhood was once a forest, so there are many trees and shade. We have to clean up leaves in the fall. It's a lot of work, but the smell of burning leaves is nice.\n\nWe don't have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of the house. We don't use the front door much. I like to work in the garage on my truck. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet. But sometimes we see many cars because family members visit from other places. I like living here. If the street weren't a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "My home is in the middle of the desert. It is a dry and brown place. People who live here are used to seeing so much dirt. If you don't live here, you might not understand this. When I lived here in the nineteen nineties, there were not many houses. Now there are more. The area is changing like many places. People here are usually friendly. But, like in any city, there are good and bad things. I live near old people who are kind. My neighborhood is nice.\n\nThere are not many stores in my area. Most are big chains. You can buy food at places like Food for Less or Smart. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Most people in my city work in construction. This is because the city is growing and there is still much empty space. I work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like my job.\n\nI like my home because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is a hard place for animals to live. We need to learn about the animals that live here so we can coexist peacefully. My family and I like the animals. My children are excited to see lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them.\n\nIf you visit my area, there are some things to see. Victorville is good for families who want to experience the desert. You can go to the San Bernardino County Fair. It is a fun event. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the mountains and ski. If you want to learn about the desert's history and culture, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has interesting objects and stories about the area.",
            "I am different from other people who live in a neighborhood. I do not live in a house with a family. Instead, I live in a college. My neighborhood is the people and the buildings on my college campus. My dorm is my home. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood.\n\nMy neighborhood has many buildings. Some are big and have many rooms. These are called apartments. Many students live in these buildings. Each building has about 20 people. Some buildings are small and have only a few rooms. These are not very common.\n\nThere are also houses that students can rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. But not many students live in these houses.\n\nMost students live in dorm rooms. These rooms are shared with one other person. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from many cultures and countries live here. The people who run the college, like professors and staff, live in the houses. Students live in the apartments and dorm rooms. We all come together to make a community.\n\nMy neighborhood has many stores. We have places to eat, buy food, and buy school clothes. We have everything we need right here.\n\nOur campus has a park. It is a safe and clean place for everyone to go. We take care of it together.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. I moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was sad at first because I missed my old home and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a new place with good housing and a good high school. \n\nIt took some time, but I got used to the new neighborhood. I made some new friends and some new enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are nice people and I consider them like family. I remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun and I was happy to be there. I caught a white strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but I did not catch the flowers.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I use a GPS to help me find my way. I like to explore and have fun with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games and enjoy life together. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I like to bring sticks and practice my balance, and I like to bring my wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. My dad taught me and my friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a lot of fun, but we were also very tired. The neighborhood has many good memories for me. I am glad I lived here and I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I like my neighborhood. It is near the college I attend. This is good for me because I can walk to class. The neighborhood has many apartment buildings. Some of these buildings are old, but they have been fixed up. There are a few restaurants and bars in the area. These places are fun to visit and not too expensive.\n\nOne of the bars recently changed its name. It is more expensive than the others. But the service and drinks are not bad. Most people in the neighborhood are nice. They are students or they have low incomes because the apartments are not very expensive.\n\nThere are many children in the area because there is a school nearby. I do not know my neighbors. But I do not want to know them. They smoke a lot of marijuana, and my landlord put a machine to freshen the air in front of their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny.\n\nThe buildings around me look old, but they have new things inside. Some people live in new buildings down the street. But I do not like them. I think they are poorly built, and the rent is too high. They are near the college, so the owners can charge a lot of money.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates, and most of the food is cooked in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard that it is a bad place to work.\n\nThe city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now the sidewalk is big and there is grass on the sides of the road. This makes the area look nicer. But my apartment building is covered in trees. Some of the trees were cut down, and there are stumps left. There are many more trees near my home than on the other street.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. But 43rd Street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look bad. There are many trees on this street, but they hide the way the buildings look. There is a lot of crime on this street. But I think my area is okay. I can afford it, and there are many useful things near my home. I like that the college is close, and there are two bus stops so I can go to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses on a circle street. The houses look like separate homes, but they are part of a larger building. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of our driveways some evenings and talk while the children play outside. It is a good feeling in this world with many machines and computers. It is like being in the past. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But we have a problem. There are storms with strong winds called tornadoes. This season, we have had warnings. Last night, we heard the sirens and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of big ice pieces falling from the sky. After the storm, the street was hot and the ice melted. It was very hot outside, but then it started to rain. I saw a beautiful color in the sky, like a big rainbow. I quickly took a picture with my camera. Then, people slowly came home from where they were. It was quiet again, and then it was like normal. Parents and children were outside, and dinner was cooking. I like my neighborhood. I recently moved from one state to another. I love the way people talk in this new place. I live in a two-bedroom apartment, like most of my neighbors. But some apartments are small. It doesn't make sense to me. I like to walk in the big field behind my home and go to the pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a good place to live, not too far from the city. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to enter eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to a boy who lives next door and another boy on my street. Neither of them lives there now, but I still think about the good times we had. Most of the people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. It has two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside when it is warm. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. People are friendly and do not bother you unless you need help. I have ordered packages online many times and never had them stolen. I trust my neighbors. A park is close to my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt there playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now, I go to the park to visit my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and reminds me of my childhood. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There are also fast food places and pizza shops. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. Some stores are different, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I see stories on social media and the news about people having problems with their neighbors, and I am grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns in the area. But it has a big job in the agriculture business. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town is proud of this title and has a sign that says so.\n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. There are many peach trees and cattle. Most of the houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer. Or they have gray shingles. The houses are far away from the road. They are near fields where people grow food for animals.\n\nIn the middle of the town, there is one traffic light. This is where the only stores are. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. But people often go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things and is busy all day.\n\nThere is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. The owner is kind and well-known in the community. She has been in business for a long time and delivers furniture to people's homes. Next to the furniture store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of dogs and other animals. There is a doctor's office and a vet's office in the town. They are small, but good at their jobs. There is an elementary school in the town. But when kids get a little older, they go to school in another town.\n\nThere is no park in the town, but they are building a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. The town is small, so there is not much to do. There is no movie theater, no bowling alley, and no place to walk your dog. But it is a nice town. You can drive through it quickly and not notice it's there.",
            "The first time I heard about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who went missing. It surprised me. Almost every apartment in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's because of the hard times. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. It is expensive, but we have learned to be careful with money. You start to like the smell of old toys from flea markets and old clothes that are not used. You smell less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just get used to things being like this. But flea markets always exist. The smell of adulthood is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in the leather even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three thrift stores near my home that I can walk to. If I start on one side, I can visit two stores that sell used things for charity, a library, a store that sells rare books, and a store that sells strange things. Downtown is crowded, with many cars and people. But it is quiet in the thrift stores. You cannot hear the noise of cars and people from inside. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more people and cars come to this area. It is a growing city, they say. It is home to a big company that sells things online and delivers them. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals, and nobody asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It is different from the South, where people care about each other. You do not ask questions about each other's lives here. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will be busy like the sea. It is a lively place to be. There is always something happening, like music from the pianist next door or singing from the people upstairs. We have less of an apartment with strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other when we need it, celebrate birthdays, and mourn when someone dies. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring mail to my neighbors, and they bring it to me. It is nice to see them, and I think they like my presence as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but it is my neighbors who make me feel like I did not completely ruin my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is very neat and clean. A homeowner's group helps keep everything looking good. You see many single-family homes with well-maintained lawns. Each lawn has small trees, grass, and pebbles. Every house has a two-car garage. The streets are in good condition. They are paved and smooth. You will not see any holes in the road. Most houses have one floor, but some have two. There are no mailboxes in front of each house. There is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. People use a key to get their mail. There are two large boxes for packages. We have a lot of space because our neighborhood is on the edge of the nearby city. It is like a mix of country and suburban areas. We have many things here. There are community swimming pools and walking paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can get exercise by walking around the neighborhood. Many people in our community are retired. It is a safe area. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young professionals living here. The city is big in population but feels small. It has many things you need. We have one big shopping center. It is not very big, but it has what you need. It takes 15 minutes to drive to any important place. After that, you can find many stores. Some stores sell healthy food, and others sell things at low prices. In general, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things here, like pools and walking paths. We can easily drive to any big store we want.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town near a big city. It is a town with a lower income area. My neighborhood is on the east side. The houses here are not expensive. Many people live here who have low incomes. However, the neighborhood is not ugly or unpleasant. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nThere is a little more crime here than in other areas of the town. There have been some violent crimes, like shootings and one murder. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting. But my family has not been hurt by crime. We have lost some things if we left them outside.\n\nThe town has a problem with the \"opioid epidemic.\" Many people have died from overdoses. But there are places to help people with addiction. We have programs to stop people from dying from overdoses.\n\nMy town has good and bad things. The elementary school is good. The teachers and staff are helpful. My son likes going to school. They have programs to make sure kids do not get bullied. All kids get free food at school. No one is treated unfairly because they do not have money.\n\nThe town's leaders have made the town look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But most of these changes happened in the center of town and where people shop. My neighborhood does not get as much attention. This is a problem for us.\n\nI like living in this town. People are kind. The schools are good. There are stores to buy what we need. Our house is not worth much money, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for a long time. I do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting place. It is built on a hill. The buildings in my neighborhood are old and important. I live in a big apartment building with seven stories. It is across the street from an old theater. A short walk away is a fun bar that is popular on warm nights. People of different kinds come to this bar. Many people want to go in, especially in June and July on weekends. A little further away is a big park. The park is good for the area. Around the park, there are steps and concrete walls. In cold weather, some people sleep in tents on the sidewalk and steps. They make their tents in a row. They do this to stay warm. It doesn't snow much here, but it rains a lot. The rain makes it hard to stay warm. They stay in the city because it is warmer and near a place where they can take a shower.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not just the old buildings that I like. What I like is the people. My neighborhood used to be a bad place with a lot of violence. People still talk about this. They talk about when the police and the DEA came to clean up the streets. The people remember. They still work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their town. They tell people not to walk around at night if they are white. I think this is not true. I think it is because of old ways of thinking. Maybe I am accepted here because I am not white. Or maybe the people here see that I understand their problems. I know that racism and unfair ideas are still a problem. This is true even in a place that is supposed to be welcoming to everyone. I like my neighborhood. I like the people. I feel alive when I am walking around at night. People are kind to me. They help me when I need it. This is a place where people are real.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in a rural area. You can see farms and small cities. There is no big store like Walmart or Target. You must drive to find what you need. But my home is in a beautiful place. I live near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you can find a place to swim.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some are old and some are new. Most houses have a basement. You can see the basement from the road. Many houses have old aluminum siding. The houses are all different colors. Most houses have yards. Some yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The houses look like they belong in America. People work hard to make a living. They raise families or have raised families. You can see kids playing outside. You can see people walking dogs, riding bikes, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who lives here and who does not. You can see people grilling outside and wave. You can see people walking their dogs and smile. The lawns are well taken care of. People do not leave leaves on the ground. The grass is short and neat. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nThis neighborhood is not very pretty, but it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful. It is safe. There are important places near our neighborhood. The police station and jail are nearby. The health department is close. We have a place where people take things they do not need to the garbage. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the people keeping score. You can hear the planes flying in and out of our small airport. You can walk to get ice cream. You can walk to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is a good place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My home is in a big city. The city is very different from one place to another. One place can be a home for people, and the next place can be a store or a restaurant. There are many stores and restaurants. Some stores are big and famous. Others are small and new. Some people like to visit these stores. Some stores are in big buildings called malls. Others are on the street. The streets are not always quiet. They are near homes where people live.\n\nThere are also parks in the city. People like to visit these parks with their children. My city is home to many different kinds of people. In one place, there are many people from the LGBTQ+ community. There are also many Jewish people. And there are people from the Soviet Union. The city is very big. There are many different communities in the city. Some of these communities are near my home. There are Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These are just a few of the many communities.\n\nBut the city is very big. It takes a long time to get from one place to another. People do not like to walk. The city has very bad traffic. It is hard to find a place to park. The city is building more and more homes. Some people like this. Others do not. They do not want more people in the city. They do not want more cars on the road.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes in the city. Some people live in big buildings. Others live in small houses. Some houses are for one family. Others are for two families. This is true in my neighborhood. There are many different kinds of homes. There are people of all ages in my neighborhood. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not very close. But when I was a child, I played with my neighbors. We had fun together.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family homes. But some have been divided into two, connected to each other. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway to the left. It looks like a home from a long time ago. This was the American dream. But now things are different. The dream is not as strong as it was. My neighborhood still looks nice. But the people are not as happy. The yards are not as clean. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside. The public school is old. It has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks good. It makes the children think about their future. It makes the older people remember the past. There are a few churches, but they are not very full. The basketball courts are always busy. All the houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a family from Yemen. They are the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people are African American. The streets are wide and the children play football. They stop playing to let the cars pass. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for a long time. They know each other's families. There used to be a karate school. But it closed when people stopped watching karate movies. Now it is a pharmacy. People think medicine can solve any problem. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a low price. The children do not like it. But the older people do. They think it is a good way to have fun. There is a highway that goes through our town. But it does not come into our town. We tried to get an entrance, but the older people did not want it. They said it would ruin our town. The town is building a new school. We are choosing a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good choice.",
            "You might not see it at first glance. This area is behind a shopping strip. It does not look like a place where people live. But if you go behind the old, empty store called Whole Foods, you can find a community. You have to walk behind the hotels that are empty most of the time.\n\nThese hotels are only used sometimes. They are for family reunions in the summer. There are many apartment buildings in this community. They are next to each other. They look like they were built to be together.\n\nThe first apartments you see have had bad things happen there. We will not talk about them too much. Appearances can be deceiving. But the other buildings are a different story. Almost nobody in this area knows about them.\n\nAcross from these buildings is a college. It is a small part of a bigger college. Students go there. They drink coffee and wake up early in the morning. The gates of the college open slowly to let them in. The students go to class. People driving by get angry because the students are holding up traffic.\n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park on one side and a place where people go to get better after they break a bone. The people who run this place have nice chairs outside. They have a fan that moves the air around. Children play in the park. They spin around and fall down in the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road.\n\nOld people walk their dogs. They look at the teenagers on skateboards and the girls talking about boys and YouTube. There is a place to eat sushi nearby. It is cheap, but it is not busy. There is also a store to buy things for the pool. You can get a haircut and food at the same time. There is a place to buy frozen yogurt too. Teenagers eat frozen yogurt and do tricks on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a part of America. It is a small piece of history in a quiet part of the south. Nothing much changes here. Even time seems to stand still.",
            "She looked out at the corn fields. \"Where are we?\" she asked. I said, \"This is it!\" I knew she would be surprised to see so much open space. She was from a town where the grocery store was close to her house. She had never seen so much open land before. I told her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio. She finally understood where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a two-lane road. We passed a quarry with water. Then we came to a small development where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard, and everyone takes care of them. In the spring, the yards have many flowers and trees. The driveways have nice cars like Mercedes-Benz. They shine in the sunlight after a car wash.\n\nI went to my house, a grey stucco house. My Korean neighbor was outside. He was happy to see me. He was always mowing his lawn and singing. People in the neighborhood liked him. He was a nice person with a special history. He was a doctor a long time ago. He is older now and not as funny. He uses a John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nMy house is near a stream. There are many geese and a Terrier. The stream goes into the quarry. You can hear the bullfrogs, the stream, and the cows from the nearby farms. Across the stream is a special place. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I played there a lot as a child. I built forts and chased animals. I had friends to play with. The winters were very cold, but they were beautiful. The trees were bare, and it snowed sometimes. We made snowmen and snow angels. My sister and I played together, even though we fought sometimes. We built forts to keep our snowballs safe. We played pretend in our own little world.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special place. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This means that people in Portland are not afraid to be different. They like things that are not normal. Portland was once a small, cheap city with its own unique culture. But now, many people from California are moving here, and the city is becoming more expensive. Still, Portland is weird in a good way. It means we accept things that others do not. We have all the modern things people want. We buy many things from China. But we also have a lot of things that are not modern. We have people who practice yoga, and people who like hipsters. We even have businesspeople. Maybe being weird just means we do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, the houses are colorful. The streets are lined with gardens full of flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In the summer, people put boxes on the street with things they no longer want. These boxes are called \"free boxes.\" They can have anything in them. Sometimes they have clothes and books. But they can have anything. Walking through my neighborhood is like a treasure hunt. You never know what you might find.\n\nPortland has many different kinds of people. Some people would never pick clothes out of a box on the street. They might go to yoga with goats or watch the city soccer team play. Portland is full of people who love many things. We are also full of people who want to achieve their dreams. But some people have mental health problems that make them turn to drugs. The rain and gray skies in Portland do not help. We also have a problem with homelessness. Many people come to Portland because we have good social services. But we do not have enough services to help everyone. The people who live here are not sure what to do about it. We are not weird when it comes to this problem.",
            "The mountains are always there. They stand in the north, watching the sun rise and set every day. I often forget they are there, but they do not change. They stand strong and still, no matter what happens in my life. When I am stressed and worried, the mountains call to me. When I look at them, I feel a little better. They give me strength to go on. \n\nI first saw the mountains when I started college. They are near the university where I study. The college has many beautiful buildings and a nice pond. But the mountains are special to me. They have a special place in my heart.\n\nThe rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafes where I study and drink coffee. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is an old part of town with old buildings. It is a fun place to be. But then I can walk to the library and be in a quiet place.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. One is busy and exciting. The other is quiet and peaceful. This makes the town interesting. I have many happy memories of my time here. I walk with my friends in the park or go to a movie in the college theater. But I also have sad memories. I have cried by the pond in the middle of the night when I was feeling unhappy.\n\nI like to walk by the pond and look at the turtles and ducks. They live their lives and do their jobs. This makes me think about my own life and what I want to do. I wonder if I have a purpose. I walk to the main street and look at the mountains. They are always there. They are strong and still. They make me feel strong and able to go on.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a hard time finding it. The neighborhood is easy to reach by public transportation. It is one of the most popular ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a busy area with many Asian stores. This is because many Asian people have moved to the area in the last twenty years. You will see an Asian store on almost every block as you walk. These stores often sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, the prices are low, and they are convenient. There are several Asian stores near where I live. In fact, I can walk to four stores in just a few minutes. This makes it easy to buy groceries. Bensonhurst is not all Asian people. It is a diverse area with people from different countries and their families. Many big stores in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby with a basketball court, a field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, a playground for kids, and a water fountain for kids to play in during the summer. The park is also a place where people from different backgrounds can play together. In Bensonhurst, you will not see many big buildings for companies. Most buildings are apartments for people who own them together, or houses. Many people live in two-family houses. The people in this area are generally nice, but they can be loud. Every day, you will hear loud music from cars driving by or people speeding. If you visit at night, be careful. While Bensonhurst is safe, you might meet people who want to cause trouble. I have had some problems with people in the past, but it was a long time ago. There is also a problem with people stealing packages. This is a common problem in many areas. Another problem is that people do not follow the rules about cleaning up after their dogs. Every morning, you will see dog waste on the sidewalk as you walk to the train or the store. My biggest complaint is the dog waste on the sidewalks everywhere I go. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I do not live on a street with many sidewalks. My house is at the top of the biggest hill in my neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many people like to run up it. There is no sidewalk on my street. So, everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good condition. In some places, it is pitted. This can be a problem for drivers. The telephone and electric wires around the block look old. They are often damaged in storms. We get many storms and rainfalls in my area. This causes branches to fall on the power lines. The repairs make the lines look old and broken.\n\nThere are many tall trees here. But people do not like them. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are high up on the hill. They have big windows on the top floor to see the ocean.\n\nThe view is beautiful at sunset. The water in the bay looks nice. The sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy. This makes the sunlight weak. Most days are overcast and damp.\n\nMoss grows on everything here, including roofs, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month. It got moss and looked funny. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school nearby. Most people are older and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs run around the neighborhood. They like to jump into yards or run in the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might get in. I once found a dog in my house. I had to chase it out.\n\nRabbits are common in my neighborhood. They are big and like to dig up plants and burrow into yards. My cats like to chase them. They have made most of the rabbits leave.\n\nWe have many birds here, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even through the mist.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My home is in a quiet neighborhood. It's a street between two big roads, so we see some cars all the time. But it's not too busy. Many people in the neighborhood are friendly. They take care of their yards. In the winter, we like to sled down a hill near our house. Our home is at the corner of the street, so we see everyone who comes and goes. When we see a strange car, we take notice.\n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and play. We like to go outside and play, even when it's raining. We have a big deck where we grill food. It smells good when we cook outside. We hear lawn mowers a lot from March to October. Our neighborhood was once a forest, so there are many trees and shade. We have to clean up leaves in the fall. It's a lot of work, but the smell of burning leaves is nice.\n\nWe don't have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of the house. We don't use the front door much. I like to work in the garage on my truck. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet. But sometimes we see many cars because family members visit from other places. I like living here. If the street weren't a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "My home is in the middle of the desert. It is a dry and brown place. People who live here are used to seeing so much dirt. If you don't live here, you might not understand this. When I lived here in the nineteen nineties, there were not many houses. Now there are more. The area is changing like many places. People here are usually friendly. But, like in any city, there are good and bad things. I live near old people who are kind. My neighborhood is nice.\n\nThere are not many stores in my area. Most are big chains. You can buy food at places like Food for Less or Smart. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Most people in my city work in construction. This is because the city is growing and there is still much empty space. I work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like my job.\n\nI like my home because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is a hard place for animals to live. We need to learn about the animals that live here so we can coexist peacefully. My family and I like the animals. My children are excited to see lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them.\n\nIf you visit my area, there are some things to see. Victorville is good for families who want to experience the desert. You can go to the San Bernardino County Fair. It is a fun event. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the mountains and ski. If you want to learn about the desert's history and culture, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has interesting objects and stories about the area.",
            "I am different from other people who live in a neighborhood. I do not live in a house with a family. Instead, I live in a college. My neighborhood is the people and the buildings on my college campus. My dorm is my home. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood.\n\nMy neighborhood has many buildings. Some are big and have many rooms. These are called apartments. Many students live in these buildings. Each building has about 20 people. Some buildings are small and have only a few rooms. These are not very common.\n\nThere are also houses that students can rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. But not many students live in these houses.\n\nMost students live in dorm rooms. These rooms are shared with one other person. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from many cultures and countries live here. The people who run the college, like professors and staff, live in the houses. Students live in the apartments and dorm rooms. We all come together to make a community.\n\nMy neighborhood has many stores. We have places to eat, buy food, and buy school clothes. We have everything we need right here.\n\nOur campus has a park. It is a safe and clean place for everyone to go. We take care of it together.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. I moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was sad at first because I missed my old home and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a new place with good housing and a good high school. \n\nIt took some time, but I got used to the new neighborhood. I made some new friends and some new enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are nice people and I consider them like family. I remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun and I was happy to be there. I caught a white strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but I did not catch the flowers.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I use a GPS to help me find my way. I like to explore and have fun with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games and enjoy life together. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I like to bring sticks and practice my balance, and I like to bring my wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. My dad taught me and my friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a lot of fun, but we were also very tired. The neighborhood has many good memories for me. I am glad I lived here and I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I like my neighborhood. It is near the college I attend. This is good for me because I can walk to class. The neighborhood has many apartment buildings. Some of these buildings are old, but they have been fixed up. There are a few restaurants and bars in the area. These places are fun to visit and not too expensive.\n\nOne of the bars recently changed its name. It is more expensive than the others. But the service and drinks are not bad. Most people in the neighborhood are nice. They are students or they have low incomes because the apartments are not very expensive.\n\nThere are many children in the area because there is a school nearby. I do not know my neighbors. But I do not want to know them. They smoke a lot of marijuana, and my landlord put a machine to freshen the air in front of their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny.\n\nThe buildings around me look old, but they have new things inside. Some people live in new buildings down the street. But I do not like them. I think they are poorly built, and the rent is too high. They are near the college, so the owners can charge a lot of money.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates, and most of the food is cooked in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard that it is a bad place to work.\n\nThe city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now the sidewalk is big and there is grass on the sides of the road. This makes the area look nicer. But my apartment building is covered in trees. Some of the trees were cut down, and there are stumps left. There are many more trees near my home than on the other street.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. But 43rd Street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look bad. There are many trees on this street, but they hide the way the buildings look. There is a lot of crime on this street. But I think my area is okay. I can afford it, and there are many useful things near my home. I like that the college is close, and there are two bus stops so I can go to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses on a circle street. The houses look like separate homes, but they are part of a larger building. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of our driveways some evenings and talk while the children play outside. It is a good feeling in this world with many machines and computers. It is like being in the past. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But we have a problem. There are storms with strong winds called tornadoes. This season, we have had warnings. Last night, we heard the sirens and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of big ice pieces falling from the sky. After the storm, the street was hot and the ice melted. It was very hot outside, but then it started to rain. I saw a beautiful color in the sky, like a big rainbow. I quickly took a picture with my camera. Then, people slowly came home from where they were. It was quiet again, and then it was like normal. Parents and children were outside, and dinner was cooking. I like my neighborhood. I recently moved from one state to another. I love the way people talk in this new place. I live in a two-bedroom apartment, like most of my neighbors. But some apartments are small. It doesn't make sense to me. I like to walk in the big field behind my home and go to the pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a good place to live, not too far from the city. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to enter eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to a boy who lives next door and another boy on my street. Neither of them lives there now, but I still think about the good times we had. Most of the people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. It has two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside when it is warm. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. People are friendly and do not bother you unless you need help. I have ordered packages online many times and never had them stolen. I trust my neighbors. A park is close to my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt there playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now, I go to the park to visit my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and reminds me of my childhood. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There are also fast food places and pizza shops. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. Some stores are different, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I see stories on social media and the news about people having problems with their neighbors, and I am grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns in the area. But it has a big job in the agriculture business. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town is proud of this title and has a sign that says so.\n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. There are many peach trees and cattle. Most of the houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer. Or they have gray shingles. The houses are far away from the road. They are near fields where people grow food for animals.\n\nIn the middle of the town, there is one traffic light. This is where the only stores are. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. But people often go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things and is busy all day.\n\nThere is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. The owner is kind and well-known in the community. She has been in business for a long time and delivers furniture to people's homes. Next to the furniture store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of dogs and other animals. There is a doctor's office and a vet's office in the town. They are small, but good at their jobs. There is an elementary school in the town. But when kids get a little older, they go to school in another town.\n\nThere is no park in the town, but they are building a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. The town is small, so there is not much to do. There is no movie theater, no bowling alley, and no place to walk your dog. But it is a nice town. You can drive through it quickly and not notice it's there.",
            "The first time I heard about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who went missing. It surprised me. Almost every apartment in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's because of the hard times. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. It is expensive, but we have learned to be careful with money. You start to like the smell of old toys from flea markets and old clothes that are not used. You smell less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just get used to things being like this. But flea markets always exist. The smell of adulthood is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in the leather even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three thrift stores near my home that I can walk to. If I start on one side, I can visit two stores that sell used things for charity, a library, a store that sells rare books, and a store that sells strange things. Downtown is crowded, with many cars and people. But it is quiet in the thrift stores. You cannot hear the noise of cars and people from inside. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more people and cars come to this area. It is a growing city, they say. It is home to a big company that sells things online and delivers them. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals, and nobody asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It is different from the South, where people care about each other. You do not ask questions about each other's lives here. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will be busy like the sea. It is a lively place to be. There is always something happening, like music from the pianist next door or singing from the people upstairs. We have less of an apartment with strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other when we need it, celebrate birthdays, and mourn when someone dies. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring mail to my neighbors, and they bring it to me. It is nice to see them, and I think they like my presence as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but it is my neighbors who make me feel like I did not completely ruin my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is very neat and clean. A homeowner's group helps keep everything looking good. You see many single-family homes with well-maintained lawns. Each lawn has small trees, grass, and pebbles. Every house has a two-car garage. The streets are in good condition. They are paved and smooth. You will not see any holes in the road. Most houses have one floor, but some have two. There are no mailboxes in front of each house. There is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. People use a key to get their mail. There are two large boxes for packages. We have a lot of space because our neighborhood is on the edge of the nearby city. It is like a mix of country and suburban areas. We have many things here. There are community swimming pools and walking paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can get exercise by walking around the neighborhood. Many people in our community are retired. It is a safe area. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young professionals living here. The city is big in population but feels small. It has many things you need. We have one big shopping center. It is not very big, but it has what you need. It takes 15 minutes to drive to any important place. After that, you can find many stores. Some stores sell healthy food, and others sell things at low prices. In general, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things here, like pools and walking paths. We can easily drive to any big store we want.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town near a big city. It is a town with a lower income area. My neighborhood is on the east side. The houses here are not expensive. Many people live here who have low incomes. However, the neighborhood is not ugly or unpleasant. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nThere is a little more crime here than in other areas of the town. There have been some violent crimes, like shootings and one murder. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting. But my family has not been hurt by crime. We have lost some things if we left them outside.\n\nThe town has a problem with the \"opioid epidemic.\" Many people have died from overdoses. But there are places to help people with addiction. We have programs to stop people from dying from overdoses.\n\nMy town has good and bad things. The elementary school is good. The teachers and staff are helpful. My son likes going to school. They have programs to make sure kids do not get bullied. All kids get free food at school. No one is treated unfairly because they do not have money.\n\nThe town's leaders have made the town look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But most of these changes happened in the center of town and where people shop. My neighborhood does not get as much attention. This is a problem for us.\n\nI like living in this town. People are kind. The schools are good. There are stores to buy what we need. Our house is not worth much money, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for a long time. I do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting place. It is built on a hill. The buildings in my neighborhood are old and important. I live in a big apartment building with seven stories. It is across the street from an old theater. A short walk away is a fun bar that is popular on warm nights. People of different kinds come to this bar. Many people want to go in, especially in June and July on weekends. A little further away is a big park. The park is good for the area. Around the park, there are steps and concrete walls. In cold weather, some people sleep in tents on the sidewalk and steps. They make their tents in a row. They do this to stay warm. It doesn't snow much here, but it rains a lot. The rain makes it hard to stay warm. They stay in the city because it is warmer and near a place where they can take a shower.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not just the old buildings that I like. What I like is the people. My neighborhood used to be a bad place with a lot of violence. People still talk about this. They talk about when the police and the DEA came to clean up the streets. The people remember. They still work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their town. They tell people not to walk around at night if they are white. I think this is not true. I think it is because of old ways of thinking. Maybe I am accepted here because I am not white. Or maybe the people here see that I understand their problems. I know that racism and unfair ideas are still a problem. This is true even in a place that is supposed to be welcoming to everyone. I like my neighborhood. I like the people. I feel alive when I am walking around at night. People are kind to me. They help me when I need it. This is a place where people are real.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in a rural area. You can see farms and small cities. There is no big store like Walmart or Target. You must drive to find what you need. But my home is in a beautiful place. I live near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you can find a place to swim.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some are old and some are new. Most houses have a basement. You can see the basement from the road. Many houses have old aluminum siding. The houses are all different colors. Most houses have yards. Some yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The houses look like they belong in America. People work hard to make a living. They raise families or have raised families. You can see kids playing outside. You can see people walking dogs, riding bikes, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who lives here and who does not. You can see people grilling outside and wave. You can see people walking their dogs and smile. The lawns are well taken care of. People do not leave leaves on the ground. The grass is short and neat. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nThis neighborhood is not very pretty, but it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful. It is safe. There are important places near our neighborhood. The police station and jail are nearby. The health department is close. We have a place where people take things they do not need to the garbage. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the people keeping score. You can hear the planes flying in and out of our small airport. You can walk to get ice cream. You can walk to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is a good place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My home is in a big city. The city is very different from one place to another. One place can be a home for people, and the next place can be a store or a restaurant. There are many stores and restaurants. Some stores are big and famous. Others are small and new. Some people like to visit these stores. Some stores are in big buildings called malls. Others are on the street. The streets are not always quiet. They are near homes where people live.\n\nThere are also parks in the city. People like to visit these parks with their children. My city is home to many different kinds of people. In one place, there are many people from the LGBTQ+ community. There are also many Jewish people. And there are people from the Soviet Union. The city is very big. There are many different communities in the city. Some of these communities are near my home. There are Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These are just a few of the many communities.\n\nBut the city is very big. It takes a long time to get from one place to another. People do not like to walk. The city has very bad traffic. It is hard to find a place to park. The city is building more and more homes. Some people like this. Others do not. They do not want more people in the city. They do not want more cars on the road.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes in the city. Some people live in big buildings. Others live in small houses. Some houses are for one family. Others are for two families. This is true in my neighborhood. There are many different kinds of homes. There are people of all ages in my neighborhood. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not very close. But when I was a child, I played with my neighbors. We had fun together.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family homes. But some have been divided into two, connected to each other. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway to the left. It looks like a home from a long time ago. This was the American dream. But now things are different. The dream is not as strong as it was. My neighborhood still looks nice. But the people are not as happy. The yards are not as clean. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside. The public school is old. It has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks good. It makes the children think about their future. It makes the older people remember the past. There are a few churches, but they are not very full. The basketball courts are always busy. All the houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a family from Yemen. They are the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people are African American. The streets are wide and the children play football. They stop playing to let the cars pass. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for a long time. They know each other's families. There used to be a karate school.

The children do not like it. But the older people do. They think it is a good way to have fun. There is a highway that goes through our town. But it does not come into our town.

            "You might not see it at first glance. This area is behind a shopping strip. It does not look like a place where people live. But if you go behind the old, empty store called Whole Foods, you can find a community. You have to walk behind the hotels that are empty most of the time.\n\nThese hotels are only used sometimes. They are for family reunions in the summer. There are many apartment buildings in this community. They are next to each other. They look like they were built to be together.\n\nThe first apartments you see have had bad things happen there. We will not talk about them too much. Appearances can be deceiving. But the other buildings are a different story. Almost nobody in this area knows about them.\n\nAcross from these buildings is a college. It is a small part of a bigger college. Students go there. They drink coffee and wake up early in the morning. The gates of the college open slowly to let them in. The students go to class. People driving by get angry because the students are holding up traffic.\n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park on one side and a place where people go to get better after they break a bone. The people who run this place have nice chairs outside. They have a fan that moves the air around. Children play in the park. They spin around and fall down in the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road.\n\nOld people walk their dogs. They look at the teenagers on skateboards and the girls talking about boys and YouTube. There is a place to eat sushi nearby. It is cheap, but it is not busy. There is also a store to buy things for the pool. You can get a haircut and food at the same time. There is a place to buy frozen yogurt too. Teenagers eat frozen yogurt and do tricks on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a part of America. It is a small piece of history in a quiet part of the south. Nothing much changes here. Even time seems to stand still.",

She was from a town where the grocery store was close to her house. She had never seen so much open land before. I told her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio. She finally understood where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a two-lane road. We passed a quarry with water. Then we came to a small development where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard, and everyone takes care of them. In the spring, the yards have many flowers and trees. The driveways have nice cars like Mercedes-Benz.

People in the neighborhood liked him. He was a nice person with a special history. He was a doctor a long time ago. He is older now and not as funny. He uses a John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nMy house is near a stream. There are many geese and a Terrier. The stream goes into the quarry. You can hear the bullfrogs, the stream, and the cows from the nearby farms. Across the stream is a special place. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I played there a lot as a child. I built forts and chased animals. I had friends to play with. The winters were very cold, but they were beautiful. The trees were bare, and it snowed sometimes. We made snowmen and snow angels.

            "Portland, Oregon is a special place. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This means that people in Portland are not afraid to be different. They like things that are not normal. Portland was once a small, cheap city with its own unique culture. But now, many people from California are moving here, and the city is becoming more expensive. Still, Portland is weird in a good way. It means we accept things that others do not. We have all the modern things people want. We buy many things from China. But we also have a lot of things that are not modern. We have people who practice yoga, and people who like hipsters. We even have businesspeople. Maybe being weird just means we do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, the houses are colorful. The streets are lined with gardens full of flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In the summer, people put boxes on the street with things they no longer want. These boxes are called \"free boxes.\" They can have anything in them. Sometimes they have clothes and books. But they can have anything. Walking through my neighborhood is like a treasure hunt. You never know what you might find.\n\nPortland has many different kinds of people. Some people would never pick clothes out of a box on the street. They might go to yoga with goats or watch the city soccer team play. Portland is full of people who love many things. We are also full of people who want to achieve their dreams. But some people have mental health problems that make them turn to drugs. The rain and gray skies in Portland do not help. We also have a problem with homelessness. Many people come to Portland because we have good social services. But we do not have enough services to help everyone. The people who live here are not sure what to do about it. We are not weird when it comes to this problem.",
            "The mountains are always there. They stand in the north, watching the sun rise and set every day. I often forget they are there, but they do not change. They stand strong and still, no matter what happens in my life. When I am stressed and worried, the mountains call to me. When I look at them, I feel a little better. They give me strength to go on. \n\nI first saw the mountains when I started college. They are near the university where I study. The college has many beautiful buildings and a nice pond. But the mountains are special to me. They have a special place in my heart.\n\nThe rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafes where I study and drink coffee. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is an old part of town with old buildings. It is a fun place to be. But then I can walk to the library and be in a quiet place.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. One is busy and exciting. The other is quiet and peaceful. This makes the town interesting. I have many happy memories of my time here. I walk with my friends in the park or go to a movie in the college theater. But I also have sad memories. I have cried by the pond in the middle of the night when I was feeling unhappy.\n\nI like to walk by the pond and look at the turtles and ducks. They live their lives and do their jobs. This makes me think about my own life and what I want to do. I wonder if I have a purpose. I walk to the main street and look at the mountains. They are always there. They are strong and still.

            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a hard time finding it. The neighborhood is easy to reach by public transportation. It is one of the most popular ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a busy area with many Asian stores. This is because many Asian people have moved to the area in the last twenty years. You will see an Asian store on almost every block as you walk. These stores often sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, the prices are low, and they are convenient. There are several Asian stores near where I live. In fact, I can walk to four stores in just a few minutes. This makes it easy to buy groceries. Bensonhurst is not all Asian people. It is a diverse area with people from different countries and their families. Many big stores in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby with a basketball court, a field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, a playground for kids, and a water fountain for kids to play in during the summer. The park is also a place where people from different backgrounds can play together. In Bensonhurst, you will not see many big buildings for companies. Most buildings are apartments for people who own them together, or houses. Many people live in two-family houses. The people in this area are generally nice, but they can be loud. Every day, you will hear loud music from cars driving by or people speeding. If you visit at night, be careful. While Bensonhurst is safe, you might meet people who want to cause trouble. I have had some problems with people in the past, but it was a long time ago. There is also a problem with people stealing packages. This is a common problem in many areas. Another problem is that people do not follow the rules about cleaning up after their dogs. Every morning, you will see dog waste on the sidewalk as you walk to the train or the store. My biggest complaint is the dog waste on the sidewalks everywhere I go. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I do not live on a street with many sidewalks. My house is at the top of the biggest hill in my neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many people like to run up it. There is no sidewalk on my street. So, everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good condition. In some places, it is pitted. This can be a problem for drivers. The telephone and electric wires around the block look old. They are often damaged in storms. We get many storms and rainfalls in my area. This causes branches to fall on the power lines. The repairs make the lines look old and broken.\n\nThere are many tall trees here. But people do not like them. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are high up on the hill. They have big windows on the top floor to see the ocean.\n\nThe view is beautiful at sunset. The water in the bay looks nice. The sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy. This makes the sunlight weak. Most days are overcast and damp.\n\nMoss grows on everything here, including roofs, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month. It got moss and looked funny. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school nearby. Most people are older and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs run around the neighborhood. They like to jump into yards or run in the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might get in. I once found a dog in my house. I had to chase it out.\n\nRabbits are common in my neighborhood. They are big and like to dig up plants and burrow into yards. My cats like to chase them. They have made most of the rabbits leave.\n\nWe have many birds here, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even through the mist.",

Our home is at the corner of the street, so we see everyone who comes and goes. When we see a strange car, we take notice.\n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and play. We like to go outside and play, even when it's raining. We have a big deck where we grill food. It smells good when we cook outside. We hear lawn mowers a lot from March to October. Our neighborhood was once a forest, so there are many trees and shade. We have to clean up leaves in the fall. It's a lot of work, but the smell of burning leaves is nice.\n\nWe don't have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of the house. We don't use the front door much. I like to work in the garage on my truck. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet. But sometimes we see many cars because family members visit from other places. I like living here. If the street weren't a main road, it would be perfect.",

When I lived here in the nineteen nineties, there were not many houses. Now there are more. The area is changing like many places. People here are usually friendly. But, like in any city, there are good and bad things. I live near old people who are kind. My neighborhood is nice.\n\nThere are not many stores in my area. Most are big chains. You can buy food at places like Food for Less or Smart. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Most people in my city work in construction. This is because the city is growing and there is still much empty space. I work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like my job.\n\nI like my home because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is a hard place for animals to live. We need to learn about the animals that live here so we can coexist peacefully. My family and I like the animals. My children are excited to see lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them.\n\nIf you visit my area, there are some things to see. Victorville is good for families who want to experience the desert. You can go to the San Bernardino County Fair. It is a fun event. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the mountains and ski. If you want to learn about the desert's history and culture, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has interesting objects and stories about the area.",

My neighborhood is the people and the buildings on my college campus. My dorm is my home. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood.\n\nMy neighborhood has many buildings. Some are big and have many rooms. These are called apartments. Many students live in these buildings. Each building has about 20 people. Some buildings are small and have only a few rooms. These are not very common.\n\nThere are also houses that students can rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. But not many students live in these houses.\n\nMost students live in dorm rooms. These rooms are shared with one other person. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from many cultures and countries live here.

It is a safe and clean place for everyone to go. We take care of it together.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. I moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was sad at first because I missed my old home and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a new place with good housing and a good high school. \n\nIt took some time, but I got used to the new neighborhood. I made some new friends and some new enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are nice people and I consider them like family. I remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun and I was happy to be there. I caught a white strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but I did not catch the flowers.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I use a GPS to help me find my way. I like to explore and have fun with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games and enjoy life together. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I like to bring sticks and practice my balance, and I like to bring my wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. My dad taught me and my friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a lot of fun, but we were also very tired. The neighborhood has many good memories for me. I am glad I lived here and I am excited to see what the future holds.",

These places are fun to visit and not too expensive.\n\nOne of the bars recently changed its name. It is more expensive than the others. But the service and drinks are not bad. Most people in the neighborhood are nice. They are students or they have low incomes because the apartments are not very expensive.\n\nThere are many children in the area because there is a school nearby. I do not know my neighbors. But I do not want to know them. They smoke a lot of marijuana, and my landlord put a machine to freshen the air in front of their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny.\n\nThe buildings around me look old, but they have new things inside. Some people live in new buildings down the street. But I do not like them. I think they are poorly built, and the rent is too high. They are near the college, so the owners can charge a lot of money.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates, and most of the food is cooked in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard that it is a bad place to work.\n\nThe city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now the sidewalk is big and there is grass on the sides of the road. This makes the area look nicer. But my apartment building is covered in trees. Some of the trees were cut down, and there are stumps left. There are many more trees near my home than on the other street.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. But 43rd Street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look bad. There are many trees on this street, but they hide the way the buildings look. There is a lot of crime on this street. But I think my area is okay. I can afford it, and there are many useful things near my home. I like that the college is close, and there are two bus stops so I can go to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses on a circle street. The houses look like separate homes, but they are part of a larger building. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of our driveways some evenings and talk while the children play outside. It is a good feeling in this world with many machines and computers. It is like being in the past. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But we have a problem. There are storms with strong winds called tornadoes. This season, we have had warnings. Last night, we heard the sirens and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of big ice pieces falling from the sky. After the storm, the street was hot and the ice melted. It was very hot outside, but then it started to rain. I saw a beautiful color in the sky, like a big rainbow. I quickly took a picture with my camera. Then, people slowly came home from where they were. It was quiet again, and then it was like normal. Parents and children were outside, and dinner was cooking. I like my neighborhood. I recently moved from one state to another. I love the way people talk in this new place. I live in a two-bedroom apartment, like most of my neighbors. But some apartments are small. It doesn't make sense to me. I like to walk in the big field behind my home and go to the pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a good place to live, not too far from the city. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to enter eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to a boy who lives next door and another boy on my street. Neither of them lives there now, but I still think about the good times we had. Most of the people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. It has two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside when it is warm. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. People are friendly and do not bother you unless you need help. I have ordered packages online many times and never had them stolen. I trust my neighbors. A park is close to my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt there playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now, I go to the park to visit my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and reminds me of my childhood. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There are also fast food places and pizza shops. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. Some stores are different, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I see stories on social media and the news about people having problems with their neighbors, and I am grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns in the area. But it has a big job in the agriculture business. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town is proud of this title and has a sign that says so.\n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. There are many peach trees and cattle. Most of the houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer. Or they have gray shingles. The houses are far away from the road. They are near fields where people grow food for animals.\n\nIn the middle of the town, there is one traffic light. This is where the only stores are. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. But people often go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things and is busy all day.\n\nThere is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. The owner is kind and well-known in the community. She has been in business for a long time and delivers furniture to people's homes. Next to the furniture store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of dogs and other animals. There is a doctor's office and a vet's office in the town. They are small, but good at their jobs. There is an elementary school in the town. But when kids get a little older, they go to school in another town.\n\nThere is no park in the town, but they are building a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. The town is small, so there is not much to do. There is no movie theater, no bowling alley, and no place to walk your dog. But it is a nice town. You can drive through it quickly and not notice it's there.",
            "The first time I heard about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who went missing. It surprised me. Almost every apartment in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's because of the hard times. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. It is expensive, but we have learned to be careful with money. You start to like the smell of old toys from flea markets and old clothes that are not used. You smell less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just get used to things being like this. But flea markets always exist. The smell of adulthood is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in the leather even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three thrift stores near my home that I can walk to. If I start on one side, I can visit two stores that sell used things for charity, a library, a store that sells rare books, and a store that sells strange things. Downtown is crowded, with many cars and people. But it is quiet in the thrift stores. You cannot hear the noise of cars and people from inside. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more people and cars come to this area. It is a growing city, they say. It is home to a big company that sells things online and delivers them. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals, and nobody asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It is different from the South, where people care about each other. You do not ask questions about each other's lives here. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will be busy like the sea. It is a lively place to be. There is always something happening, like music from the pianist next door or singing from the people upstairs. We have less of an apartment with strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other when we need it, celebrate birthdays, and mourn when someone dies. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring mail to my neighbors, and they bring it to me. It is nice to see them, and I think they like my presence as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but it is my neighbors who make me feel like I did not completely ruin my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is very neat and clean. A homeowner's group helps keep everything looking good. You see many single-family homes with well-maintained lawns. Each lawn has small trees, grass, and pebbles. Every house has a two-car garage. The streets are in good condition. They are paved and smooth. You will not see any holes in the road. Most houses have one floor, but some have two. There are no mailboxes in front of each house. There is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. People use a key to get their mail. There are two large boxes for packages. We have a lot of space because our neighborhood is on the edge of the nearby city. It is like a mix of country and suburban areas. We have many things here. There are community swimming pools and walking paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can get exercise by walking around the neighborhood. Many people in our community are retired. It is a safe area. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young professionals living here. The city is big in population but feels small. It has many things you need. We have one big shopping center. It is not very big, but it has what you need. It takes 15 minutes to drive to any important place. After that, you can find many stores. Some stores sell healthy food, and others sell things at low prices. In general, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things here, like pools and walking paths. We can easily drive to any big store we want.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town near a big city. It is a town with a lower income area. My neighborhood is on the east side. The houses here are not expensive. Many people live here who have low incomes. However, the neighborhood is not ugly or unpleasant. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nThere is a little more crime here than in other areas of the town. There have been some violent crimes, like shootings and one murder. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting. But my family has not been hurt by crime. We have lost some things if we left them outside.\n\nThe town has a problem with the \"opioid epidemic.\" Many people have died from overdoses. But there are places to help people with addiction. We have programs to stop people from dying from overdoses.\n\nMy town has good and bad things. The elementary school is good. The teachers and staff are helpful. My son likes going to school. They have programs to make sure kids do not get bullied. All kids get free food at school. No one is treated unfairly because they do not have money.\n\nThe town's leaders have made the town look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But most of these changes happened in the center of town and where people shop. My neighborhood does not get as much attention. This is a problem for us.\n\nI like living in this town. People are kind. The schools are good. There are stores to buy what we need. Our house is not worth much money, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for a long time. I do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting place. It is built on a hill. The buildings in my neighborhood are old and important. I live in a big apartment building with seven stories. It is across the street from an old theater. A short walk away is a fun bar that is popular on warm nights. People of different kinds come to this bar. Many people want to go in, especially in June and July on weekends. A little further away is a big park. The park is good for the area. Around the park, there are steps and concrete walls. In cold weather, some people sleep in tents on the sidewalk and steps. They make their tents in a row. They do this to stay warm. It doesn't snow much here, but it rains a lot. The rain makes it hard to stay warm. They stay in the city because it is warmer and near a place where they can take a shower.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not just the old buildings that I like. What I like is the people. My neighborhood used to be a bad place with a lot of violence. People still talk about this. They talk about when the police and the DEA came to clean up the streets. The people remember. They still work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their town. They tell people not to walk around at night if they are white. I think this is not true. I think it is because of old ways of thinking. Maybe I am accepted here because I am not white. Or maybe the people here see that I understand their problems. I know that racism and unfair ideas are still a problem. This is true even in a place that is supposed to be welcoming to everyone. I like my neighborhood. I like the people. I feel alive when I am walking around at night. People are kind to me. They help me when I need it. This is a place where people are real.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in a rural area. You can see farms and small cities. There is no big store like Walmart or Target. You must drive to find what you need. But my home is in a beautiful place. I live near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you can find a place to swim.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some are old and some are new. Most houses have a basement. You can see the basement from the road. Many houses have old aluminum siding. The houses are all different colors. Most houses have yards. Some yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The houses look like they belong in America. People work hard to make a living. They raise families or have raised families. You can see kids playing outside. You can see people walking dogs, riding bikes, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who lives here and who does not. You can see people grilling outside and wave. You can see people walking their dogs and smile. The lawns are well taken care of. People do not leave leaves on the ground. The grass is short and neat. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nThis neighborhood is not very pretty, but it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful. It is safe. There are important places near our neighborhood. The police station and jail are nearby. The health department is close. We have a place where people take things they do not need to the garbage. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the people keeping score. You can hear the planes flying in and out of our small airport. You can walk to get ice cream. You can walk to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is a good place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

The city's unofficial message is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some people think this means keeping the city how it was in the 1990s and early 2000s. That was a time when Portland was not well-known and less expensive. Many creative and unique groups lived there. To others, \"Keep Portland Weird\" means come to the city and be accepted as different.

            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, is a good place to visit. Getting there is easy. You can use public transportation. Many people use public transportation in New York City. Bensonhurst is a city neighborhood. You will feel like you are in New York City. You will see many Asian stores. Many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst in the last twenty years. You will see an Asian store almost every block. They sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and it is convenient. I live near here. Four Asian supermarkets are near me. You can walk to them in two minutes. This makes it easy to buy food. Bensonhurst is not only Asian people. It is diverse. Many people are immigrants and their families. Many businesses are owned by Asian people. There is a new park near here. It has basketball courts, a soccer field, handball courts, swings, and a water fountain. The park is safe and people of all kinds play there. There are no big company buildings here. Most people live in two-family houses. The people are nice, but some can be loud. You may hear music from cars and people driving fast. If you visit at night, be careful. This neighborhood is safe, but some people can be mean. I was hurt here many years ago. Recently, some people stole packages from homes. People do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the street every day. My biggest problem is dog waste on the sidewalk. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",

We have no sidewalks on my street, so people walk on the road. The road has some holes, and it can be hard to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around my block look old and broken. It rains and storms often here, so branches and other things hit the wires and cause problems. We need to repair them often. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. But people dislike the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high on the hill with big windows to see the water. It's beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange. But the sky is often cloudy and damp. Moss grows on things like roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month, and when I came back, it was covered with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. We don't have many children in my neighborhood. There is a school nearby, but most people are older and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. It's common to see them in yards or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, dogs might get in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. We also have rabbits. They dig up plants and burrow into yards. My cats like to hunt them. We have many birds: small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by until the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. We have some rocks by the water where you can throw things.

So, we see everyone who comes and goes. We notice strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen years old.\n\nWe go outside a lot, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck. It's nice to smell the barbecue. Every day, we hear lawn mowers from March to October. Our neighborhood was once a forest, so there are many trees and shade. In the fall, we rake and burn leaves. I like the smell of burning leaves, which means fall has arrived.\n\nWe don't have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house. We use the front door only when someone visits. I like to work in the garage and feel connected to the neighborhood when the garage doors are open. During holidays, it's quiet. But on Thanksgiving and other holidays, we see more cars because families visit from out of town.\n\nOverall, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of a desert. It is very dry and brown. You see dirt everywhere. If you have not lived here, you may not understand how it feels to see no green for a long time. When I first moved here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. The area looks more like a town every day. But it is not the only place that is changing. Many places are like this.\n\nMost people are friendly here. But like in any town, there are good and bad things. I live near older people. They are nice. The stores here are chain stores like Food for Less and Smart. If you want to buy something special, you have to go somewhere else. There are no stores like Whole Foods here. The main jobs in my town are in construction. Many people work here because the town is still growing and there is much open space to build. I am a drywall and T-bar installer. I like my job.\n\nI like my home because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is hard to live in, but it is home to many animals. Humans must learn about these animals to live here safely. My family and I like the animals. We have three children and they like catching lizards and bugs. We go outside and try to catch them.\n\nWe have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. You can have fun and learn something new. There is an annual event called the San Bernardino County Fair. You should visit during the fair. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see the snow and go skiing. If you are interested in the history of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see.",
            "My neighborhood is a special place. I live in a college campus. My community is the people who live in my dorm. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood. But, it's not like other neighborhoods.\n\nMy neighborhood has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's talk about the houses first. There are three kinds of houses here. First, there are apartments. They have 2-4 people in each room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building has 2 floors and 20 people.\n\nThen, there are houses that people can rent. These houses are usually 2-4 bedrooms. But there are not many of them because they are not very useful. Finally, there are dorm rooms. These rooms have 2 people sharing a room. They are the most common kind of housing here.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from all cultures and ages live here. The professional staff live in the houses, and the new students live in dorms. The older students live in apartments.\n\nLet's talk about the stores and parks. My school has many stores. They have food, clothes, and other things. We can buy what we need here. We also have one park. It's a place for everyone to play. The park is clean and safe because everyone in my neighborhood looks after it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. At first, I was unhappy. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was sad because I missed my old home and my friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. They moved us to a new home in a better neighborhood. The new neighborhood had a good school and safe streets.\n\nOver time, I made new friends and enemies in school. I did not know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family. They are nice people who I like. They are like a second family to me. I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun.\n\nI was happy to see Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, remove her bandage and throw it. I caught the bandage, but not the flowers. We danced and had a good time. I enjoyed myself with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters. I have not seen her since.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I have a GPS now. I can explore more easily. I have walked around with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful.\n\nI like to practice my balance with sticks I buy from the store. I also bring my wooden sword and have fun. There are basketball and tennis courts in the neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and a man named Mr. Graves. We worked hard, but we had fun.\n\nI have many happy memories in this neighborhood. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "My house is near a college where I study. I like living there. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants and bars. I like going to these places because they are not too expensive. One bar changed its name and is now more expensive, but it's still okay. The people in my neighborhood are nice. They are mostly college students or people with low incomes because the apartments are not very expensive. There are many children near my house. There is a school for them within walking distance. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The manager of my building put a machine that makes the air smell good near their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It's like they are being scolded.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but the inside might be new. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I don't like them. They are cheaply made and the rent is high. I think this is unfair. The people who live in these apartments are rich because they are near the college. The city gives them money to make the area look nice. The road near my house was fixed last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk and grass on the sides of the road. But my apartment building has many trees. Some of them were cut down, so there are stumps left. There are more trees near my house than on the street behind me. Behind my building, there are trees and another apartment complex.\n\nI live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It's not as nice. The sidewalk is bad and falling apart. The buildings look old and tired. There are many trees on this street to hide how bad the buildings look. There have been problems with crime in my area, mostly in one apartment complex. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and it's close to the university. There is a store and a downtown area near my house that I can get to easily by bus.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses on a circular street. The houses are close together. They look like separate houses, but they are really connected. They are painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. We stand on the end of the street some evenings and talk while the children play with toys, draw with chalk or fly kites. This is nice in a world with many machines and computers. It is like going back in time. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But this season, we have had warning signs for tornadoes. For the first time, we heard real tornado sirens last night. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my small dog and a few pillows. My big dog was in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of big hail on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steaming. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in a short time. The hail melted on the road. The sun came out, and it started to rain. I saw a double rainbow in the sky. I quickly took pictures with my camera. The streets were quiet for a while. Then people came home from wherever they were. It was business as usual - moms and children outside while dinner cooked. I like my neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people speak here. I have a two-bedroom and two-bathroom apartment. But all the houses look the same on the outside. The apartments are not the same on the inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond that is not for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning, I hear a big frog singing. It is a nice place to live near the city of Charlotte. Every morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey in a farm near here that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I got close to a friend who lives two houses away and another guy on my street. They no longer live here, but I still remember them. Most people who lived here when I moved in are still living here. My neighborhood is like many American suburbs. It has two-story houses. Every weekend, I hear kids playing outside when it's warm. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had problems with my neighbors. You can be alone unless you need help. I have ordered packages online and never had one stolen. I trust my neighbors. A park is near my house. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends there. I had a bad memory there when I got hit in the nose playing football. But I have many good memories. Now, I visit the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger and like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me feel nostalgic. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. In a short distance, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. People often use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. There are many fast food places, and you can find them in most neighborhoods. There are also many pizza places. We have many stores with everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store called Jewel-Osco. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I feel lucky because some people on social media and the news have bad experiences with their neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns in the state. But Johnston is special because it is known as the Peach Capital of the World. This is why you will see a big sign welcoming visitors.\n\nThe town is mostly farmland. You will see many peach trees and cows. The houses are far apart. Most are two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles. The houses are not near the road. Instead, they are in the fields.\n\nIn the center of the town, there is a single traffic light. This is where you can find a few stores. There is a Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong. There is also a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. There is a small burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. But most people go to a bigger store in another town to buy their food. The most popular store in Johnston is Dollar General. It sells many things and is always busy.\n\nThere is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They have been in business for a long time and deliver their furniture. Next to the furniture store, there is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of pets and sell things to make them look nice.\n\nThere are two small medical offices in the town. One is for doctors and the other is for animals. There is a small school in the town called Johnston Elementary School. But when children get older, they go to school in another town.\n\nThere is no park in the town, but they are making a new park. It will be 2.5 acres big and people can use it to have fun. But there is not much to do in Johnston. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys or playgrounds. It is a small town, but it is nice.",
            "I first heard my place's story on a podcast about people who went missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it is because of the struggle. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive, but we have learned to save money. You get used to the smell of old toys and old clothes. You smell less as an adult. Some people smoke, and some people get used to things.\n\nThere are three thrift stores I can walk to. If I start on one side, I can visit two charity stores, a library, a used bookstore, and a shop with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every day, but you cannot hear it in the thrift stores. It is quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more and more people and cars come. It is a growing city. One of the biggest online companies is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People do not ask you many questions. You can be alone and quiet, and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where people are more friendly. Here, people do not ask you many questions. You can keep to yourself. The city is lively. The pianist next door and the singers upstairs play music. We have a community. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals together. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and share food with them. They do the same for me. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company.\n\nI live in a big, modern building, but my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a common type of neighborhood. It is called a suburb. Many homes here look the same. They are well taken care of because of a group called the homeowner's association. The homes have small lawns, some pebbles, and short driveways. Some trees are present. Everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are new and in good condition. There are no big holes on the road. The houses are usually one story, but some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there is a large box at the end of the street. People use a key to get to their mailbox. There are also big boxes for packages. The homeowner's association is responsible for this.\n\nMy house is on the edge of a bigger city. This makes our neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban areas. We have a lot of space. There are community pools that everyone can use. They are well taken care of and locked. There are also walking paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You do not need to go to a park to exercise. Our neighborhood is big enough to walk around and get some exercise. Most of the people who live here are old. Our area is safe, and people look out for each other. Some younger people and middle-aged people also live here.\n\nThe city is big, but it feels small. We have many things that people need. For example, we have one big store called a mall. It is not very big, but it has what we need. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to get to important places. When I get there, I can find many stores. We have stores that sell good food and stores that sell things cheap. All in all, my neighborhood is safe and good. We have nice things like pools and paths to walk on. We are not very close to stores, but we can drive to get to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. The town is close to a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not the most wealthy area. The houses are not very expensive. Many people rent or own these houses. They are mostly low-income families. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello to me when I walk outside.\n\nThere is some crime in our area. It is a little higher than in other parts of the town. There have been some shootings and a few murders in the last 10 years. But nothing has happened to my family. We have lost a few things from our porch, but that is all.\n\nThe town has a big problem. Many people have died from opioid overdoses. This is a big problem all over the United States. We have help for people with addiction. There are centers to help them get better. The townspeople are trying to stop this problem.\n\nOur town has some good things too. My son's school is great. The teachers and staff are excellent. They take care of my son and make sure he is safe. He has a disability, but he does not get bullied. Everyone is very friendly. The school gives food to all students so they do not go hungry. No one has to pay for school things like lunch or supplies.\n\nThe town leaders are making our town look better. They are fixing roads and parks. But most of the work is done in the center of the town and the west side. The east side, where I live, is not as nice. People are unhappy about this.\n\nI like living in this town. My neighbors are nice, the school is great, and we have many stores to buy things. Our house is not very expensive, but it is okay. We have lived here for 16 years and we do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. People go there. I live in a tall building. It has seven floors. Across the street is an old theater. A few blocks away is a small bar. People go there on warm summer nights. They like to play games and have fun. \n\nNearby is a big park. It is a good place to walk and play. The park is surrounded by strong walls. During the cold winter months, homeless people live there. They set up tents in a row. They are warm because they are close together. They can walk to a place where they can wash their bodies.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not the beautiful buildings or the old streets that I like. It is the people. People used to live in my neighborhood in a bad way. There was much violence. The government and police came to stop the violence. People remember this. They tell their children and grandchildren about it.\n\nEven though my neighborhood is not perfect, people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city and their block. They want to make it a good place to live. Some people think it is not safe at night. They say white people should not walk there at night. I think this is a reminder of a bad time. I think it is because people do not understand each other. But I feel safe on my street. People are kind to me. They give me help when I need it. One day, a person gave me money when I was cold and alone. They said I was beautiful and valuable. I like my neighborhood because of the people. It is home for me. I feel happy when I walk on the streets at night. People are friendly and kind. They make me feel welcome.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is far from big cities. We do not have big shopping centers like Wal-mart or Target. There is an Applebee's restaurant, but we have to drive to get there. Our town is near two big lakes. Lake Michigan is one and Lake Charlevoix is the other. Everywhere you look, you can see a place to swim. My home is in a neighborhood with many houses. They are not the same, but they are old and nice. Some are being fixed up. Many houses have basements. You can see the basements from the street. The houses are different colors. Most of them have yards. You can see kids playing on trampolines and swings. Some people grow food in their yards. The houses look like they belong in the middle of America. People work hard to make a living. They often have families or have raised families. You can see kids playing on the streets. People walk dogs and ride bicycles. We know our neighbors. We can tell who belongs here and who does not. We see people grilling outside and say hello. We see people walking their dogs and smile. The lawns are kept nice. People do not leave leaves on the ground. The grass is cut and looks nice. If people have plants, they are cut back. Our neighborhood is not a fancy place, but it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful. It is safe. We have a police station and a jail nearby. The health department is close too. We have a recycling center. People use the services it offers. We have baseball and softball fields. You can hear the people calling the games. Our small airport is nearby. You can hear the planes flying. You can walk to get ice cream from a store near my house. My kids can ride their bicycles to the park, which is a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Sometimes it snows, and the yard becomes a winter wonderland. My sister and I would make snowmen and fight with snowballs. We built forts to store our snowballs. We played in our own little world and didn't worry about anything.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that loves being different. The city's unofficial message is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some people think this means keeping the city how it was in the 1990s and early 2000s. That was a time when Portland was not well-known and less expensive. Many creative and unique groups lived there. To others, \"Keep Portland Weird\" means come to the city and be accepted as different. Even though many people from California have moved here, and many new buildings are being built, Portland is still a strange and accepting place. We are not always accepting, but we accept things that others do not. We have modern things like everyone else, but we do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, you can see many colorful houses and home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In the summer, you can find free boxes on the street. These are boxes with things people are giving away. You can find clothes, books, and even other things. Sometimes you can find something special. That is what Portland is all about to me. But I am just one person, and there are many others like me. Some people I live with would never take things from the street. They go to goat yoga or watch soccer games.\n\nPortland has people who love many things. Some people have big dreams, but they spend too much time at the bar. Portland has problems like many cities. We have a problem with drugs. Many of these problems are about mental health. We have a lot of rain and cloudy skies, which can be hard to deal with. We also have a problem with homelessness. Many people come to Portland for help, but we do not have enough services. The people who have homes do not know what to do about this problem. They feel both sad and angry.",
            "The mountains are always there. They stand in the north, watching the sun rise and set. They do not move or change. They are strong and steady. When I am busy or stressed, they remind me to stop and look at them. They give me strength to keep going. I first saw the mountains when I started college. They were near our campus. The college has many beautiful things, but the mountains are special. I like the buildings, ponds, and trees on campus. But the mountains are the most important.\n\nThe town is also nice. There are many cafes where I studied and had coffee. You can walk or take a bus to the town center. It's old and colorful. The buildings are made of bricks that are fading. It's like a different world. But then you can go back to the quiet town and feel peaceful. This town has two different feelings. You can feel happy and busy in the town center. Or you can feel calm in the quiet town. I like this feeling. It's like the town is inviting me to explore.\n\nI have many happy memories in this town. I walked with friends to the park after studying all night. We sat on the swings and talked. I also went to the movie theater with friends. The college gave us tickets. But the town also has sad memories. We all have sad memories in life. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I sat by the pond when I was feeling lost. I watched the turtles and ducks living their lives. I wondered about my own life and what I wanted to do.\n\nI walked to the main street and saw the sun shining. I looked up and saw the mountains in the distance. They were still there, strong and steady. They reminded me to keep going. They made me feel brave.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, is a good place to visit. Getting there is easy. You can use public transportation. Many people use public transportation in New York City. Bensonhurst is a city neighborhood. You will feel like you are in New York City. You will see many Asian stores. Many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst in the last twenty years. You will see an Asian store almost every block. They sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and it is convenient. I live near here. Four Asian supermarkets are near me. You can walk to them in two minutes. This makes it easy to buy food. Bensonhurst is not only Asian people. It is diverse. Many people are immigrants and their families. Many businesses are owned by Asian people. There is a new park near here. It has basketball courts, a soccer field, handball courts, swings, and a water fountain. The park is safe and people of all kinds play there. There are no big company buildings here. Most people live in two-family houses. The people are nice, but some can be loud. You may hear music from cars and people driving fast. If you visit at night, be careful. This neighborhood is safe, but some people can be mean. I was hurt here many years ago. Recently, some people stole packages from homes. People do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the street every day. My biggest problem is dog waste on the sidewalk. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I live in a place without many sidewalks. My house is located at the top of a steep hill. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many people jog there. We have no sidewalks on my street, so people walk on the road. The road has some holes, and it can be hard to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around my block look old and broken. It rains and storms often here, so branches and other things hit the wires and cause problems. We need to repair them often. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. But people dislike the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high on the hill with big windows to see the water. It's beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange. But the sky is often cloudy and damp. Moss grows on things like roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month, and when I came back, it was covered with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. We don't have many children in my neighborhood. There is a school nearby, but most people are older and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. It's common to see them in yards or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, dogs might get in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. We also have rabbits. They dig up plants and burrow into yards. My cats like to hunt them. We have many birds: small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by until the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. We have some rocks by the water where you can throw things. The bay is not very big, but you can see the other side clearly on most days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. It's near two big roads, so there is some traffic. But overall, it's a quiet neighborhood. Few people move in or out, so we know most of our neighbors. They work in their yards and do daily tasks. In the winter, we sled down a nearby hill.\n\nWe live in a house at the corner of our street. So, we see everyone who comes and goes. We notice strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen years old.\n\nWe go outside a lot, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck. It's nice to smell the barbecue. Every day, we hear lawn mowers from March to October. Our neighborhood was once a forest, so there are many trees and shade. In the fall, we rake and burn leaves. I like the smell of burning leaves, which means fall has arrived.\n\nWe don't have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house. We use the front door only when someone visits. I like to work in the garage and feel connected to the neighborhood when the garage doors are open. During holidays, it's quiet. But on Thanksgiving and other holidays, we see more cars because families visit from out of town.\n\nOverall, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of a desert. It is very dry and brown. You see dirt everywhere. If you have not lived here, you may not understand how it feels to see no green for a long time. When I first moved here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. The area looks more like a town every day. But it is not the only place that is changing. Many places are like this.\n\nMost people are friendly here. But like in any town, there are good and bad things. I live near older people. They are nice. The stores here are chain stores like Food for Less and Smart. If you want to buy something special, you have to go somewhere else. There are no stores like Whole Foods here. The main jobs in my town are in construction. Many people work here because the town is still growing and there is much open space to build. I am a drywall and T-bar installer. I like my job.\n\nI like my home because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is hard to live in, but it is home to many animals. Humans must learn about these animals to live here safely. My family and I like the animals. We have three children and they like catching lizards and bugs. We go outside and try to catch them.\n\nWe have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. You can have fun and learn something new. There is an annual event called the San Bernardino County Fair. You should visit during the fair. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see the snow and go skiing. If you are interested in the history of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see.",
            "My neighborhood is a special place. I live in a college campus. My community is the people who live in my dorm. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood. But, it's not like other neighborhoods.\n\nMy neighborhood has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's talk about the houses first. There are three kinds of houses here. First, there are apartments. They have 2-4 people in each room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building has 2 floors and 20 people.\n\nThen, there are houses that people can rent. These houses are usually 2-4 bedrooms. But there are not many of them because they are not very useful. Finally, there are dorm rooms. These rooms have 2 people sharing a room. They are the most common kind of housing here.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from all cultures and ages live here. The professional staff live in the houses, and the new students live in dorms. The older students live in apartments.\n\nLet's talk about the stores and parks. My school has many stores. They have food, clothes, and other things. We can buy what we need here. We also have one park. It's a place for everyone to play. The park is clean and safe because everyone in my neighborhood looks after it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. At first, I was unhappy. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was sad because I missed my old home and my friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. They moved us to a new home in a better neighborhood. The new neighborhood had a good school and safe streets.\n\nOver time, I made new friends and enemies in school. I did not know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family. They are nice people who I like. They are like a second family to me. I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun.\n\nI was happy to see Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, remove her bandage and throw it. I caught the bandage, but not the flowers. We danced and had a good time. I enjoyed myself with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters. I have not seen her since.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I have a GPS now. I can explore more easily. I have walked around with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful.\n\nI like to practice my balance with sticks I buy from the store. I also bring my wooden sword and have fun. There are basketball and tennis courts in the neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and a man named Mr. Graves. We worked hard, but we had fun.\n\nI have many happy memories in this neighborhood. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "My house is near a college where I study. I like living there. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants and bars. I like going to these places because they are not too expensive. One bar changed its name and is now more expensive, but it's still okay. The people in my neighborhood are nice. They are mostly college students or people with low incomes because the apartments are not very expensive. There are many children near my house. There is a school for them within walking distance. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The manager of my building put a machine that makes the air smell good near their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It's like they are being scolded.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but the inside might be new. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I don't like them. They are cheaply made and the rent is high. I think this is unfair. The people who live in these apartments are rich because they are near the college. The city gives them money to make the area look nice. The road near my house was fixed last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk and grass on the sides of the road. But my apartment building has many trees. Some of them were cut down, so there are stumps left. There are more trees near my house than on the street behind me. Behind my building, there are trees and another apartment complex.\n\nI live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It's not as nice. The sidewalk is bad and falling apart. The buildings look old and tired. There are many trees on this street to hide how bad the buildings look. There have been problems with crime in my area, mostly in one apartment complex. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and it's close to the university. There is a store and a downtown area near my house that I can get to easily by bus.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses on a circular street. The houses are close together. They look like separate houses, but they are really connected. They are painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. We stand on the end of the street some evenings and talk while the children play with toys, draw with chalk or fly kites. This is nice in a world with many machines and computers. It is like going back in time. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But this season, we have had warning signs for tornadoes. For the first time, we heard real tornado sirens last night. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my small dog and a few pillows. My big dog was in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of big hail on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steaming. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in a short time. The hail melted on the road. The sun came out, and it started to rain. I saw a double rainbow in the sky. I quickly took pictures with my camera. The streets were quiet for a while. Then people came home from wherever they were. It was business as usual - moms and children outside while dinner cooked. I like my neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people speak here. I have a two-bedroom and two-bathroom apartment. But all the houses look the same on the outside. The apartments are not the same on the inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond that is not for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning, I hear a big frog singing. It is a nice place to live near the city of Charlotte. Every morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey in a farm near here that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I got close to a friend who lives two houses away and another guy on my street. They no longer live here, but I still remember them. Most people who lived here when I moved in are still living here. My neighborhood is like many American suburbs. It has two-story houses. Every weekend, I hear kids playing outside when it's warm. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had problems with my neighbors. You can be alone unless you need help. I have ordered packages online and never had one stolen. I trust my neighbors. A park is near my house. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends there. I had a bad memory there when I got hit in the nose playing football. But I have many good memories. Now, I visit the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger and like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me feel nostalgic. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. In a short distance, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. People often use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. There are many fast food places, and you can find them in most neighborhoods. There are also many pizza places. We have many stores with everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store called Jewel-Osco. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I feel lucky because some people on social media and the news have bad experiences with their neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns in the state. But Johnston is special because it is known as the Peach Capital of the World. This is why you will see a big sign welcoming visitors.\n\nThe town is mostly farmland. You will see many peach trees and cows. The houses are far apart. Most are two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles. The houses are not near the road. Instead, they are in the fields.\n\nIn the center of the town, there is a single traffic light. This is where you can find a few stores. There is a Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong. There is also a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. There is a small burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. But most people go to a bigger store in another town to buy their food. The most popular store in Johnston is Dollar General. It sells many things and is always busy.\n\nThere is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They have been in business for a long time and deliver their furniture. Next to the furniture store, there is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of pets and sell things to make them look nice.\n\nThere are two small medical offices in the town. One is for doctors and the other is for animals. There is a small school in the town called Johnston Elementary School. But when children get older, they go to school in another town.\n\nThere is no park in the town, but they are making a new park. It will be 2.5 acres big and people can use it to have fun. But there is not much to do in Johnston. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys or playgrounds. It is a small town, but it is nice.",
            "I first heard my place's story on a podcast about people who went missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it is because of the struggle. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive, but we have learned to save money. You get used to the smell of old toys and old clothes. You smell less as an adult. Some people smoke, and some people get used to things.\n\nThere are three thrift stores I can walk to. If I start on one side, I can visit two charity stores, a library, a used bookstore, and a shop with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every day, but you cannot hear it in the thrift stores. It is quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more and more people and cars come. It is a growing city. One of the biggest online companies is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People do not ask you many questions. You can be alone and quiet, and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where people are more friendly. Here, people do not ask you many questions. You can keep to yourself. The city is lively. The pianist next door and the singers upstairs play music. We have a community. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals together. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and share food with them. They do the same for me. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company.\n\nI live in a big, modern building, but my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a common type of neighborhood. It is called a suburb. Many homes here look the same. They are well taken care of because of a group called the homeowner's association. The homes have small lawns, some pebbles, and short driveways. Some trees are present. Everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are new and in good condition. There are no big holes on the road. The houses are usually one story, but some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there is a large box at the end of the street. People use a key to get to their mailbox. There are also big boxes for packages. The homeowner's association is responsible for this.\n\nMy house is on the edge of a bigger city. This makes our neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban areas. We have a lot of space. There are community pools that everyone can use. They are well taken care of and locked. There are also walking paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You do not need to go to a park to exercise. Our neighborhood is big enough to walk around and get some exercise. Most of the people who live here are old. Our area is safe, and people look out for each other. Some younger people and middle-aged people also live here.\n\nThe city is big, but it feels small. We have many things that people need. For example, we have one big store called a mall. It is not very big, but it has what we need. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to get to important places. When I get there, I can find many stores. We have stores that sell good food and stores that sell things cheap. All in all, my neighborhood is safe and good. We have nice things like pools and paths to walk on. We are not very close to stores, but we can drive to get to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. The town is close to a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not the most wealthy area. The houses are not very expensive. Many people rent or own these houses. They are mostly low-income families. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello to me when I walk outside.\n\nThere is some crime in our area. It is a little higher than in other parts of the town. There have been some shootings and a few murders in the last 10 years. But nothing has happened to my family. We have lost a few things from our porch, but that is all.\n\nThe town has a big problem. Many people have died from opioid overdoses. This is a big problem all over the United States. We have help for people with addiction. There are centers to help them get better. The townspeople are trying to stop this problem.\n\nOur town has some good things too. My son's school is great. The teachers and staff are excellent. They take care of my son and make sure he is safe. He has a disability, but he does not get bullied. Everyone is very friendly. The school gives food to all students so they do not go hungry. No one has to pay for school things like lunch or supplies.\n\nThe town leaders are making our town look better. They are fixing roads and parks. But most of the work is done in the center of the town and the west side. The east side, where I live, is not as nice. People are unhappy about this.\n\nI like living in this town. My neighbors are nice, the school is great, and we have many stores to buy things. Our house is not very expensive, but it is okay. We have lived here for 16 years and we do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. People go there. I live in a tall building. It has seven floors. Across the street is an old theater. A few blocks away is a small bar. People go there on warm summer nights. They like to play games and have fun. \n\nNearby is a big park. It is a good place to walk and play. The park is surrounded by strong walls. During the cold winter months, homeless people live there. They set up tents in a row. They are warm because they are close together. They can walk to a place where they can wash their bodies.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not the beautiful buildings or the old streets that I like. It is the people. People used to live in my neighborhood in a bad way. There was much violence. The government and police came to stop the violence. People remember this. They tell their children and grandchildren about it.\n\nEven though my neighborhood is not perfect, people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city and their block. They want to make it a good place to live. Some people think it is not safe at night. They say white people should not walk there at night. I think this is a reminder of a bad time. I think it is because people do not understand each other. But I feel safe on my street. People are kind to me. They give me help when I need it. One day, a person gave me money when I was cold and alone. They said I was beautiful and valuable. I like my neighborhood because of the people. It is home for me. I feel happy when I walk on the streets at night. People are friendly and kind. They make me feel welcome.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is far from big cities. We do not have big shopping centers like Wal-mart or Target. There is an Applebee's restaurant, but we have to drive to get there. Our town is near two big lakes. Lake Michigan is one and Lake Charlevoix is the other. Everywhere you look, you can see a place to swim. My home is in a neighborhood with many houses. They are not the same, but they are old and nice. Some are being fixed up. Many houses have basements. You can see the basements from the street. The houses are different colors. Most of them have yards. You can see kids playing on trampolines and swings. Some people grow food in their yards. The houses look like they belong in the middle of America. People work hard to make a living. They often have families or have raised families. You can see kids playing on the streets. People walk dogs and ride bicycles. We know our neighbors. We can tell who belongs here and who does not. We see people grilling outside and say hello. We see people walking their dogs and smile. The lawns are kept nice. People do not leave leaves on the ground. The grass is cut and looks nice. If people have plants, they are cut back. Our neighborhood is not a fancy place, but it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful. It is safe. We have a police station and a jail nearby. The health department is close too. We have a recycling center. People use the services it offers. We have baseball and softball fields. You can hear the people calling the games. Our small airport is nearby. You can hear the planes flying. You can walk to get ice cream from a store near my house. My kids can ride their bicycles to the park, which is a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk to the back, you will find a community. There are buildings that serve as homes, one next to the other. These buildings are like small houses that are connected together.\n\nSome of these buildings have been in the news for problems. We will not talk about those buildings too much. But the buildings next to those are a different world. Almost no one in the area knows about them.\n\nAcross from these buildings is a small college. It is a quiet place with a few buildings. Students go there to learn. They come and go, drinking coffee and yawning. The gates of the college open slowly to let them in. The people who drive by are a little angry that the students are causing traffic.\n\nThe road splits into another road. There is a park on one side and a place that helps people who broke their bones. The place has nice furniture outside and a big fan that moves the air.\n\nChildren play in the park. They are happy and healthy. There are flowers by the road. Bees fly around them. Old people walk their dogs on a path in the park. They look at the teenagers on skateboards and the girls talking about boys and YouTube.\n\nThere is a place that serves sushi in a shopping area near the park. It is not very busy. There is a store that sells things for pools and a place that does nails. You can buy a pool and get a manicure at the same time. There is a place that sells frozen yogurt. People eat it while they do tricks on their skateboards.\n\nThe area is a part of America. It is a piece of history in a quiet part of the south. Not much changes here, not even time.",
            "We drove past fields of corn that stretched as far as the eye could see. \"Where are we?\" she asked. \"This is it,\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the open space. She was from a town where the grocery store was close to her house. She had never seen so much empty land.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. She finally understood who I was and where I came from. We drove on a two-lane road. We passed a big hole in the ground filled with water. After that, we came to a small area where people live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People like to take care of their yards. In the spring, many flowers grow, and the trees change with the seasons. The driveways have nice cars. They shine in the sunlight after they are washed.\n\nAs we drove, my neighbor was outside. He was friendly. He was mowing his lawn and singing. Everyone likes him. He is a good person with a special past. He used to be a doctor. He is older now and not as quick-witted as he used to be. He likes to ride his lawn mower and listen to its sound.\n\nWe finally came to my house. There are geese in the yard, and our dog chases them. There is a stream in the back. You can hear the water, the frogs, and the cows from the farms. Across a bridge made of wood, there is a special area with trees, herbs, and flowers that grow on their own. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts in the trees and played with my friends. In the winter, the yard is empty and quiet. The trees look like skeletons. Sometimes it snows, and the yard becomes a winter wonderland. My sister and I would make snowmen and fight with snowballs. We built forts to store our snowballs. We played in our own little world and didn't worry about anything.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that loves being different. The city's unofficial message is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some people think this means keeping the city how it was in the 1990s and early 2000s. That was a time when Portland was not well-known and less expensive. Many creative and unique groups lived there. To others, \"Keep Portland Weird\" means come to the city and be accepted as different. Even though many people from California have moved here, and many new buildings are being built, Portland is still a strange and accepting place. We are not always accepting, but we accept things that others do not. We have modern things like everyone else, but we do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, you can see many colorful houses and home gardens with flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In the summer, you can find free boxes on the street. These are boxes with things people are giving away. You can find clothes, books, and even other things. Sometimes you can find something special. That is what Portland is all about to me. But I am just one person, and there are many others like me. Some people I live with would never take things from the street. They go to goat yoga or watch soccer games.\n\nPortland has people who love many things. Some people have big dreams, but they spend too much time at the bar. Portland has problems like many cities. We have a problem with drugs. Many of these problems are about mental health. We have a lot of rain and cloudy skies, which can be hard to deal with. We also have a problem with homelessness. Many people come to Portland for help, but we do not have enough services. The people who have homes do not know what to do about this problem. They feel both sad and angry.",
            "The mountains are always there. They stand in the north, watching the sun rise and set. They do not move or change. They are strong and steady. When I am busy or stressed, they remind me to stop and look at them. They give me strength to keep going. I first saw the mountains when I started college. They were near our campus. The college has many beautiful things, but the mountains are special. I like the buildings, ponds, and trees on campus. But the mountains are the most important.\n\nThe town is also nice. There are many cafes where I studied and had coffee. You can walk or take a bus to the town center. It's old and colorful. The buildings are made of bricks that are fading. It's like a different world. But then you can go back to the quiet town and feel peaceful. This town has two different feelings. You can feel happy and busy in the town center. Or you can feel calm in the quiet town. I like this feeling. It's like the town is inviting me to explore.\n\nI have many happy memories in this town. I walked with friends to the park after studying all night. We sat on the swings and talked. I also went to the movie theater with friends. The college gave us tickets. But the town also has sad memories. We all have sad memories in life. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I sat by the pond when I was feeling lost. I watched the turtles and ducks living their lives. I wondered about my own life and what I wanted to do.\n\nI walked to the main street and saw the sun shining. I looked up and saw the mountains in the distance. They were still there, strong and steady. They reminded me to keep going. They made me feel brave.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, is a good place to visit. Getting there is easy. You can use public transportation. Many people use public transportation in New York City. Bensonhurst is a city neighborhood. You will feel like you are in New York City. You will see many Asian stores. Many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst in the last twenty years. You will see an Asian store almost every block. They sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, prices are low, and it is convenient. I live near here. Four Asian supermarkets are near me. You can walk to them in two minutes. This makes it easy to buy food. Bensonhurst is not only Asian people. It is diverse. Many people are immigrants and their families. Many businesses are owned by Asian people. There is a new park near here. It has basketball courts, a soccer field, handball courts, swings, and a water fountain. The park is safe and people of all kinds play there. There are no big company buildings here. Most people live in two-family houses. The people are nice, but some can be loud. You may hear music from cars and people driving fast. If you visit at night, be careful. This neighborhood is safe, but some people can be mean. I was hurt here many years ago. Recently, some people stole packages from homes. People do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the street every day. My biggest problem is dog waste on the sidewalk. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "I live in a place without many sidewalks. My house is located at the top of a steep hill. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many people jog there. We have no sidewalks on my street, so people walk on the road. The road has some holes, and it can be hard to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires around my block look old and broken. It rains and storms often here, so branches and other things hit the wires and cause problems. We need to repair them often. There are many tall evergreen trees everywhere. But people dislike the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built high on the hill with big windows to see the water. It's beautiful at sunset when the water shines and the sky turns orange. But the sky is often cloudy and damp. Moss grows on things like roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car outside for a month, and when I came back, it was covered with moss. It took me three hours to clean it off. We don't have many children in my neighborhood. There is a school nearby, but most people are older and retired. They have dogs instead of kids. It's common to see them in yards or running down the street. If you leave a door or window open, dogs might get in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. We also have rabbits. They dig up plants and burrow into yards. My cats like to hunt them. We have many birds: small sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by until the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. We have some rocks by the water where you can throw things. The bay is not very big, but you can see the other side clearly on most days.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. It's near two big roads, so there is some traffic. But overall, it's a quiet neighborhood. Few people move in or out, so we know most of our neighbors. They work in their yards and do daily tasks. In the winter, we sled down a nearby hill.\n\nWe live in a house at the corner of our street. So, we see everyone who comes and goes. We notice strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen years old.\n\nWe go outside a lot, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck. It's nice to smell the barbecue. Every day, we hear lawn mowers from March to October. Our neighborhood was once a forest, so there are many trees and shade. In the fall, we rake and burn leaves. I like the smell of burning leaves, which means fall has arrived.\n\nWe don't have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of our house. We use the front door only when someone visits. I like to work in the garage and feel connected to the neighborhood when the garage doors are open. During holidays, it's quiet. But on Thanksgiving and other holidays, we see more cars because families visit from out of town.\n\nOverall, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of a desert. It is very dry and brown. You see dirt everywhere. If you have not lived here, you may not understand how it feels to see no green for a long time. When I first moved here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. The area looks more like a town every day. But it is not the only place that is changing. Many places are like this.\n\nMost people are friendly here. But like in any town, there are good and bad things. I live near older people. They are nice. The stores here are chain stores like Food for Less and Smart. If you want to buy something special, you have to go somewhere else. There are no stores like Whole Foods here. The main jobs in my town are in construction. Many people work here because the town is still growing and there is much open space to build. I am a drywall and T-bar installer. I like my job.\n\nI like my home because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is hard to live in, but it is home to many animals. Humans must learn about these animals to live here safely. My family and I like the animals. We have three children and they like catching lizards and bugs. We go outside and try to catch them.\n\nWe have some attractions here. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. You can have fun and learn something new. There is an annual event called the San Bernardino County Fair. You should visit during the fair. You can also visit nearby Wrightwood to see the snow and go skiing. If you are interested in the history of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see.",
            "My neighborhood is a special place. I live in a college campus. My community is the people who live in my dorm. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood. But, it's not like other neighborhoods.\n\nMy neighborhood has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's talk about the houses first. There are three kinds of houses here. First, there are apartments. They have 2-4 people in each room. There are 4-6 rooms on each floor. Each building has 2 floors and 20 people.\n\nThen, there are houses that people can rent. These houses are usually 2-4 bedrooms. But there are not many of them because they are not very useful. Finally, there are dorm rooms. These rooms have 2 people sharing a room. They are the most common kind of housing here.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from all cultures and ages live here. The professional staff live in the houses, and the new students live in dorms. The older students live in apartments.\n\nLet's talk about the stores and parks. My school has many stores. They have food, clothes, and other things. We can buy what we need here. We also have one park. It's a place for everyone to play. The park is clean and safe because everyone in my neighborhood looks after it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. At first, I was unhappy. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was sad because I missed my old home and my friends. But my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my sister. They moved us to a new home in a better neighborhood. The new neighborhood had a good school and safe streets.\n\nOver time, I made new friends and enemies in school. I did not know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his family. They are nice people who I like. They are like a second family to me. I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun.\n\nI was happy to see Mr. Glen's wife, Ms. Veda, remove her bandage and throw it. I caught the bandage, but not the flowers. We danced and had a good time. I enjoyed myself with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters. I have not seen her since.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I have a GPS now. I can explore more easily. I have walked around with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful.\n\nI like to practice my balance with sticks I buy from the store. I also bring my wooden sword and have fun. There are basketball and tennis courts in the neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and a man named Mr. Graves. We worked hard, but we had fun.\n\nI have many happy memories in this neighborhood. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "My house is near a college where I study. I like living there. There are many apartment buildings, some restaurants and bars. I like going to these places because they are not too expensive. One bar changed its name and is now more expensive, but it's still okay. The people in my neighborhood are nice. They are mostly college students or people with low incomes because the apartments are not very expensive. There are many children near my house. There is a school for them within walking distance. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The manager of my building put a machine that makes the air smell good near their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It's like they are being scolded.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but the inside might be new. Down the street, there are new apartments, but I don't like them. They are cheaply made and the rent is high. I think this is unfair. The people who live in these apartments are rich because they are near the college. The city gives them money to make the area look nice. The road near my house was fixed last summer. Now there is a nice sidewalk and grass on the sides of the road. But my apartment building has many trees. Some of them were cut down, so there are stumps left. There are more trees near my house than on the street behind me. Behind my building, there are trees and another apartment complex.\n\nI live on 42nd Street. The street behind me is 43rd Street. It's not as nice. The sidewalk is bad and falling apart. The buildings look old and tired. There are many trees on this street to hide how bad the buildings look. There have been problems with crime in my area, mostly in one apartment complex. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and it's close to the university. There is a store and a downtown area near my house that I can get to easily by bus.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses on a circular street. The houses are close together. They look like separate houses, but they are really connected. They are painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Most people are friends with each other. We stand on the end of the street some evenings and talk while the children play with toys, draw with chalk or fly kites. This is nice in a world with many machines and computers. It is like going back in time. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But this season, we have had warning signs for tornadoes. For the first time, we heard real tornado sirens last night. We went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my small dog and a few pillows. My big dog was in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of big hail on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steaming. It went from 92 to 75 degrees in a short time. The hail melted on the road. The sun came out, and it started to rain. I saw a double rainbow in the sky. I quickly took pictures with my camera. The streets were quiet for a while. Then people came home from wherever they were. It was business as usual - moms and children outside while dinner cooked. I like my neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people speak here. I have a two-bedroom and two-bathroom apartment. But all the houses look the same on the outside. The apartments are not the same on the inside. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond that is not for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning, I hear a big frog singing. It is a nice place to live near the city of Charlotte. Every morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey in a farm near here that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I got close to a friend who lives two houses away and another guy on my street. They no longer live here, but I still remember them. Most people who lived here when I moved in are still living here. My neighborhood is like many American suburbs. It has two-story houses. Every weekend, I hear kids playing outside when it's warm. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had problems with my neighbors. You can be alone unless you need help. I have ordered packages online and never had one stolen. I trust my neighbors. A park is near my house. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends there. I had a bad memory there when I got hit in the nose playing football. But I have many good memories. Now, I visit the park with my cousin's kids. They are younger and like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me feel nostalgic. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. In a short distance, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. People often use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. There are many fast food places, and you can find them in most neighborhoods. There are also many pizza places. We have many stores with everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store called Jewel-Osco. Some stores are special, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I feel lucky because some people on social media and the news have bad experiences with their neighbors.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns in the state. But Johnston is special because it is known as the Peach Capital of the World. This is why you will see a big sign welcoming visitors.\n\nThe town is mostly farmland. You will see many peach trees and cows. The houses are far apart. Most are two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles. The houses are not near the road. Instead, they are in the fields.\n\nIn the center of the town, there is a single traffic light. This is where you can find a few stores. There is a Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong. There is also a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta. There is a small burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. But most people go to a bigger store in another town to buy their food. The most popular store in Johnston is Dollar General. It sells many things and is always busy.\n\nThere is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. They have been in business for a long time and deliver their furniture. Next to the furniture store, there is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of pets and sell things to make them look nice.\n\nThere are two small medical offices in the town. One is for doctors and the other is for animals. There is a small school in the town called Johnston Elementary School. But when children get older, they go to school in another town.\n\nThere is no park in the town, but they are making a new park. It will be 2.5 acres big and people can use it to have fun. But there is not much to do in Johnston. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys or playgrounds. It is a small town, but it is nice.",
            "I first heard my place's story on a podcast about people who went missing. It was surprising. Almost every apartment in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it is because of the struggle. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is expensive, but we have learned to save money. You get used to the smell of old toys and old clothes. You smell less as an adult. Some people smoke, and some people get used to things.\n\nThere are three thrift stores I can walk to. If I start on one side, I can visit two charity stores, a library, a used bookstore, and a shop with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every day, but you cannot hear it in the thrift stores. It is quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, more and more people and cars come. It is a growing city. One of the biggest online companies is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals. People do not ask you many questions. You can be alone and quiet, and people will leave you alone. This is different from the South, where people are more friendly. Here, people do not ask you many questions. You can keep to yourself. The city is lively. The pianist next door and the singers upstairs play music. We have a community. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals together. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They treat me well. I try to clean up after myself and share food with them. They do the same for me. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company.\n\nI live in a big, modern building, but my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a common type of neighborhood. It is called a suburb. Many homes here look the same. They are well taken care of because of a group called the homeowner's association. The homes have small lawns, some pebbles, and short driveways. Some trees are present. Everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are new and in good condition. There are no big holes on the road. The houses are usually one story, but some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there is a large box at the end of the street. People use a key to get to their mailbox. There are also big boxes for packages. The homeowner's association is responsible for this.\n\nMy house is on the edge of a bigger city. This makes our neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban areas. We have a lot of space. There are community pools that everyone can use. They are well taken care of and locked. There are also walking paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You do not need to go to a park to exercise. Our neighborhood is big enough to walk around and get some exercise. Most of the people who live here are old. Our area is safe, and people look out for each other. Some younger people and middle-aged people also live here.\n\nThe city is big, but it feels small. We have many things that people need. For example, we have one big store called a mall. It is not very big, but it has what we need. It takes me 15 minutes to drive to get to important places. When I get there, I can find many stores. We have stores that sell good food and stores that sell things cheap. All in all, my neighborhood is safe and good. We have nice things like pools and paths to walk on. We are not very close to stores, but we can drive to get to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. The town is close to a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not the most wealthy area. The houses are not very expensive. Many people rent or own these houses. They are mostly low-income families. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello to me when I walk outside.\n\nThere is some crime in our area. It is a little higher than in other parts of the town. There have been some shootings and a few murders in the last 10 years. But nothing has happened to my family. We have lost a few things from our porch, but that is all.\n\nThe town has a big problem. Many people have died from opioid overdoses. This is a big problem all over the United States. We have help for people with addiction. There are centers to help them get better. The townspeople are trying to stop this problem.\n\nOur town has some good things too. My son's school is great. The teachers and staff are excellent. They take care of my son and make sure he is safe. He has a disability, but he does not get bullied. Everyone is very friendly. The school gives food to all students so they do not go hungry. No one has to pay for school things like lunch or supplies.\n\nThe town leaders are making our town look better. They are fixing roads and parks. But most of the work is done in the center of the town and the west side. The east side, where I live, is not as nice. People are unhappy about this.\n\nI like living in this town. My neighbors are nice, the school is great, and we have many stores to buy things. Our house is not very expensive, but it is okay. We have lived here for 16 years and we do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is special. It is on a hill. Many old buildings are there. People go there. I live in a tall building. It has seven floors. Across the street is an old theater. A few blocks away is a small bar. People go there on warm summer nights. They like to play games and have fun. \n\nNearby is a big park. It is a good place to walk and play. The park is surrounded by strong walls. During the cold winter months, homeless people live there. They set up tents in a row. They are warm because they are close together. They can walk to a place where they can wash their bodies.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not the beautiful buildings or the old streets that I like. It is the people. People used to live in my neighborhood in a bad way. There was much violence. The government and police came to stop the violence. People remember this. They tell their children and grandchildren about it.\n\nEven though my neighborhood is not perfect, people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city and their block. They want to make it a good place to live. Some people think it is not safe at night. They say white people should not walk there at night. I think this is a reminder of a bad time. I think it is because people do not understand each other. But I feel safe on my street. People are kind to me. They give me help when I need it. One day, a person gave me money when I was cold and alone. They said I was beautiful and valuable. I like my neighborhood because of the people. It is home for me. I feel happy when I walk on the streets at night. People are friendly and kind. They make me feel welcome.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is far from big cities. We do not have big shopping centers like Wal-mart or Target. There is an Applebee's restaurant, but we have to drive to get there. Our town is near two big lakes. Lake Michigan is one and Lake Charlevoix is the other. Everywhere you look, you can see a place to swim. My home is in a neighborhood with many houses. They are not the same, but they are old and nice. Some are being fixed up. Many houses have basements. You can see the basements from the street. The houses are different colors. Most of them have yards. You can see kids playing on trampolines and swings. Some people grow food in their yards. The houses look like they belong in the middle of America. People work hard to make a living. They often have families or have raised families. You can see kids playing on the streets. People walk dogs and ride bicycles. We know our neighbors. We can tell who belongs here and who does not. We see people grilling outside and say hello. We see people walking their dogs and smile. The lawns are kept nice. People do not leave leaves on the ground. The grass is cut and looks nice. If people have plants, they are cut back. Our neighborhood is not a fancy place, but it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful. It is safe. We have a police station and a jail nearby. The health department is close too. We have a recycling center. People use the services it offers. We have baseball and softball fields. You can hear the people calling the games. Our small airport is nearby. You can hear the planes flying. You can walk to get ice cream from a store near my house. My kids can ride their bicycles to the park, which is a few blocks away. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a big city. The neighborhood is very different. Residential areas are not close together. They are between commercial areas. Commercial areas have many businesses. Some businesses are offices. Others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are a lot of new restaurants to eat at and stores to shop in. Some stores are big and well-known. They are part of big companies. Small stores are also popular. They are in shopping centers or on streets. The streets are close to quiet neighborhoods.\n\nThere are two parks near my home. People often take their young children to these parks. My neighborhood is very diverse. There is a community of people who like men and women in the same sex. There is also a Jewish community. Some people in my neighborhood came from the Soviet Union. There are many people in the city from different countries and races. Some groups of people live in their own communities. For example, we have Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These communities are not far from my neighborhood.\n\nHowever, the city is big and driving can be difficult. It takes a long time to drive a short distance. Many people do not walk. They use cars. The city has a lot of traffic. It is hard to find a parking spot. There are many new buildings being built in the city. Many people are moving to the city. Some people do not like this.\n\nThere are many kinds of houses in my city. Not all people live in big buildings. There are houses of different sizes and smaller buildings. Some houses have one family. Others have two families. This is true in my neighborhood too. People of different ages live in my neighborhood. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not a close community. But I remember playing with my next-door neighbor and other friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are single family homes, but some have been divided into two separate units. My home has a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. The houses look like they did in the past, when living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream seemed to bring people together, but now it seems to be fading away. My neighborhood still looks nice, but it is not as strong as it used to be. The people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards do not look as nice as they used to. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside as if the world is their only place. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks modern and makes young people dream of the future. The older residents feel happy when they remember the past. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are always full. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a big family from Yemen. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. Most people have lived here for a long time and know each other. There was a karate school, but it closed when kids stopped practicing karate. Now it is a pharmacy. People take medicine to feel better. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it, but older people enjoy it. There is one highway that goes through our town. We do not have an exit or entrance. We tried to get one, but older people said it would ruin our town. They told the city council to say no. We are building a new school and we are choosing a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be a good choice.",
            "You might miss this area at first glance. It is a residential area behind a shopping strip. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods, you will find a community. There are apartment buildings. They are next to each other, like Russian nesting dolls.\n\nSome of these buildings have had problems. They have been in the news. But the other buildings are different. They are a quiet world that not many people know about. Across from these buildings is a community college. Students go there every day. The road beside the college is a residential road. There is a park on one side. It has grass and flowers. Children play there. Some people walk dogs there. \n\nThere is a place to eat sushi in a strip mall. It is near the park. There is also a store to buy swimming supplies. And a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool and get a manicure at the same time. There is a place for frozen yogurt too. Teenagers like to eat there and do tricks on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a part of America. It is quiet and unchanging. It is like a piece of history.",
            "We were driving through a big area with many corn fields. She had never seen so much open space before. She was used to living in a town with a store just a short walk from her house. \"Where is everything?\" she asked. I said, \"This is it!\"\n\nShe was surprised by the many corn fields. I told her about growing up in a rural area of Ohio. This helped her understand where I was from. We were driving on a two-lane road. There was a big hole in the ground filled with water. After that, we came to a small area where people live.\n\nThe houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land. People are very proud of their yards. In the spring, many flowers and trees grow. The trees change with the seasons. The driveways have very nice cars. Many of them are Mercedes Benz. They shine in the sun after they are washed.\n\nAs we continued driving, I saw my neighbor. He is from Korea. He is always outside, mowing his lawn. He sings while he works. Everyone likes him. He used to be a doctor. He is now older and not as funny as he used to be. He likes to hide behind his grass and lawn mower.\n\nWe finally came to my house. There are many geese in the yard. My dog chases them. There is a small stream in the back. You can hear frogs, the stream, and sometimes a cow from a nearby farm. Across a small bridge, there is a special area with natural trees, herbs, and flowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and chased animals. I had many friends.\n\nIn the winter, it can be very cold here. But it is also very beautiful. The trees look like skeletons when they don't have leaves. When it snows, the yard looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We also made forts out of branches and snowballs. We used them to fight each other. We had a lot of fun playing in the snow.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that likes to call itself weird. This is shown on a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and a place that pushes the law. The sign says \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some people think this is a call to remember the city from the 1990s and early 2000s. Back then, Portland was less known and less expensive. It was a place where creative people lived and made new ideas.\n\nNow, more people are moving to Portland. They are mostly from California. The city is building many new homes for them. But Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean we do not have modern things. We buy most of our things from other countries. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. We also have normal things like other cities.\n\nWeird means we do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, people have colorful houses and gardens with flowers, herbs, and food. In the summer, people put boxes on the street with free things in them. These boxes have clothes, books, and sometimes other things. This is part of what Portland is about.\n\nPortland is a city of many different kinds of people. Some people do goat yoga, which is yoga with real goats. Others go to soccer matches. We have people who pursue their dreams and others who dream about pursuing their dreams while they are at the bar.\n\nPortland has problems. Many people in the city have mental health problems. The weather in Portland is often rainy and gray, which can make people feel sad. We also have a problem with people who do not have homes. The city offers many services to help them, but they are not enough.\n\nMost people in Portland do not know what to do about the homeless problem. Some people feel sorry for them, while others are angry. Portland is like many other cities with this problem.",
            "I look out at the mountains in the north. They are always there. They see the sun every morning and every evening. No matter how busy I am, they are always there. When I am stressed, they remind me to look at them. They give me strength to go on, one day at a time. I came to this town when I started college. The mountains near campus caught my eye. The university is nice with its buildings and ponds. But the mountains are special. The town is also nice. There are many cafes with good coffee. You can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. The old buildings there are interesting. They make the town feel old and new at the same time. This is what makes this town so special. You can find peace and excitement in the same place. I have many happy memories in this town. I remember walking past the swings in the park with my friends after a long night of studying. I also remember running through downtown to see a movie. But this town can also be sad. We all have bad memories sometimes. The ponds can be a good place to think and feel sad. I have sat by the pond many times feeling sad. I watch the animals living their lives and wonder about my own life. I think about my purpose. I walk past the houses and trees and reach the main street. The sun is shining on the palm trees and the sky is blue and yellow. I look up and see the mountains. They are still there. They remind me to be strong.",
            "If you want to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you can do so easily. Many people use public transportation in New York City, and it is very accessible. Bensonhurst is a busy neighborhood. You will feel like you are in New York City. You will see many Asian stores when you visit. Over the last twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. Because of this, you will see many Asian-owned stores. These stores sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, the prices are low, and it is convenient. There are many Asian stores near where I live. In fact, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk of each other. This makes it easy to buy food.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for Asian people. It is a mixed neighborhood with people from many countries and their children. Many businesses in the area are Asian-owned. There is also a park near where I live. The park has many basketball courts, a big field for sports, and a water fountain for kids to play in during the summer.\n\nNew York City has many parks like this one. They are good places for people to play together. In Bensonhurst, there are not many big office buildings. Most of the houses are co-op living or condominium apartments. Many people live in two-family houses. The people here are generally nice, but it can be loud. You may hear music from cars driving by or people speeding on their way to work. If you visit at night, you should be careful. Bensonhurst is a safe neighborhood, but some people can be mean. I have had problems in the past, but it was a long time ago. Recently, some people in the neighborhood have taken packages from each other's homes. People also do not clean up after their dogs as they should. You may see dog waste on the street when you go to the train station or the supermarket. This is my biggest complaint about Bensonhurst.",
            "I live in a neighborhood without many sidewalks. My house is at the top of a big hill. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many runners go there for exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street. Everyone walks on the road. The road is not very good. It has holes and can be hard to drive on. The power lines along the street are old and broken. They get hit by branches and leaves when it rains. Many tall trees are around my neighborhood. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. The houses on the hill are high up and have big windows to see the ocean. It is beautiful to see the ocean at sunset. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything. I left my car in the driveway for a month and it got covered with moss. It took me a long time to clean it off. There are not many children in my neighborhood. The school is near, but most people are old. They have dogs instead of kids. If you leave your door open, dogs can get in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. There are many wild rabbits in the area. They dig up plants and make holes in the lawns. My cats like to chase them. We also have many birds. There are small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks and eagles fly by. The neighborhood crows chase them away. There are no stores near me, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that sell fresh seafood. There is no beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side on most days.",
            "I live in a quiet neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. The street is between two state highways, so we have some traffic. But it is not too much. I know most of the people who live here. They are busy with yard work and other things. In winter, we go sledding on the hill on our street. I live in a house at the corner. I see everyone who comes and goes. Whenever we see a strange car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. I work from home. I have a wife and two daughters, eleven and fourteen years old. We go outside and play. We also grill on our deck. It is a nice smell. People cut grass every day from March to October. We have many trees, so it is cool and shady. We have to rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. This year, it feels like fall is very long because we don't have a lot of winter. Our garage is in the back of our house. I like to work on my truck and other things in the garage. When the garage door is open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet. We have visitors during Thanksgiving and Christmas. I like living here. If the street were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My home is in a desert area. It is very hot and dry. There is a lot of dirt. If you have not lived here, you might not know what it is like to see only brown everywhere. When I first lived here, the houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses being built. It looks like a city, but it is still a desert area. Most people are friendly, but like any city, it has good and bad parts. I like my neighborhood. It is nice. The stores in my area are mostly big chain stores like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. The most common jobs in my town are construction. Many buildings are being built. This worries me. I like it the way it is now. I moved from a big city, and I do not want to go back. My job is in the construction area. I install drywall and T-bar. I like living here because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has hard conditions, but it is home to different kinds of animals. We should learn about these animals to live with them safely. My family and I have learned to live with the animals. My children like lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. If you visit, you can go to the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun. You can also go to the nearby Wrightwood and see the snow-covered mountains. If you like history and science, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has rocks, bones, and objects from the past.",
            "I live in a neighborhood, but it is not like other neighborhoods. My neighborhood is the college campus where I live. I stay in a dormitory with other students. I also think of the people who live in my dormitory as my community. The campus is also my neighborhood, but not as much. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's talk about the houses in my neighborhood. There are three types of houses. First, there are apartments. In these apartments, 2-4 people share a room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. This means about 20 people live in each building. Second, there are houses that people can rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms and usually have alumni living in them. There are not many of these houses. Finally, there are dorm rooms. These rooms usually have 2 people sharing a space, except in some cases. This is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people in my neighborhood. My school values diversity. Many different cultures and ages live here. The staff lives in the houses, and the newer students live in dorms, and the older students live in apartments. We have many stores and a park in our neighborhood. The stores have food, clothes, and other things we need. We also have a park where everyone can play. The park is clean and safe because everyone in my neighborhood helps to take care of it.",
            "I have lived in my neighborhood for about 10 years. I was sad when I first came here. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and my friends. My family moved to this neighborhood for a better house and school. My mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my sister. At first, I did not like it here. But as time passed, I made new friends and acquaintances. I knew a few neighbors. There was Mr. Glen and his children. They were kind to me. I also knew Dennis, who lived next door. They were nice people. I felt close to them.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen's wedding with my family. It was a happy event. I met his daughter, Marsharii. We had a good time. I hope she is doing well now. The neighborhood can be confusing. But I have a GPS, so I can explore it. I like to go to the park and be near nature. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance by walking on sticks. Sometimes I bring my wooden sword and play with it. The neighborhood has a basketball court and a tennis court. But I do not play sports as much as I used to.\n\nMy dad taught me and my friend tennis. We had a good time with Mr. Graves. My dad made us practice hard, but we had fun. I have many happy memories of this neighborhood. There are many stories to tell. These are just a few of my favorites. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I like living near the college I attend. The college is close to my home. I walk to class most days. The area has many apartment buildings. Some buildings are old, but they are not very expensive. There are a few restaurants and bars nearby. These places are fun and not too expensive. One bar just changed its name. It is more expensive now, but the service and drinks are good. Most people in the area are nice. Some are college students, and others have lower incomes. The area has many children because there is an elementary school near my home. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My building manager put an air freshener near their door to prevent the smell. I and my boyfriend think this is funny. But it is also a little insulting.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but inside they are nice. Down the street, there are new apartments. But I do not like them. They are cheaply made, but the rent is high. This seems unfair. The new apartments are near the college, so the managers can charge high rent.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. The food is served on paper plates and is often microwaved. Across the street is a gas station. People say it is not a good place to work. However, the city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now the area looks nicer. My building has many trees. Some were cut down, but there are still many trees. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex.\n\nI live on 42nd street. The street behind my building is 43rd street. It is not as nice as 42nd street. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they hide the old buildings. There is a lot of crime on 43rd street. But I also think crime happens at other apartments across the street from me. I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many useful things nearby. I like that the college is close, and there are two bus stops near my home.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses. They are called duplexes. They are on a special street called a cul-de-sac. The houses look like separate homes. But they are connected. Each house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most people are friends with each other. They stand at the end of the street some evenings and talk. The small children in the neighborhood play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It is a nice break from a world with many machines and computers. It is like stepping back in time.\n\nThe neighborhood is surrounded by fields and trees. There are blue skies and white, fluffy clouds. But this time of year brings danger. We have to be careful of tornadoes. One day, we heard the sirens. We had to go to a safe place. I went to the bathtub with my little dog. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail. The road was hot and it made the hail melt quickly. After the storm, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared in the sky. I took a picture with my camera. The streets were quiet for a while. Then people came home from wherever they were when the storm hit. It was business as usual. People were outside while their dinners cooked.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I moved here from a place called New Hampshire. I like the way people talk in the South. Everyone in my building has a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. But not all the apartments are the same inside. Some are very small. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. I can see a pond, but it is not safe to swim in. I have seen deer and in the morning, I can hear a big frog singing. It is a great place to live, about 40 minutes from a big city called Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms around me. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I became close to a friend who lives two houses down from me and a guy who lives on my street. However, they do not live here anymore. The people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburbs. We have many two-story houses. On nice days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had any problems with my neighbors. I feel safe in this neighborhood. I have ordered packages online and they have never been stolen. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids in the neighborhood. I got hurt playing football, but I have more good memories than bad ones. Today, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. Thinking about the park makes me feel nostalgic. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find different kinds of food nearby. Within a short distance, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. There are also fast food places and pizza shops. We have many stores with everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store called Jewel-Osco. One store is owned by an Indian family. I like my neighborhood. It is nice to see how lucky I am compared to others who have problems with their neighbors.",
            "Johnston is a small town in South Carolina. It does not stand out from other towns, but it is important for farming. The town is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign at the town's entrance.\n\nMost of the town is farmland with peach trees or cows. Houses are far apart from each other. Many of them are two stories high and have metal roofs to keep the sun out. They are often not near the road, but are set back so that the front land can be used for animals or crops.\n\nIn the center of the town, there is one traffic light at a four-way stop. This is where you can find the town's stores. There are three places to buy fast food: a Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta, and a small burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizza store, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People know it for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There is also a small grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. It is the only grocery store in the town, but many people go to a bigger store in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries.\n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday things and is often busy. There is also a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in the town for a long time and has two men who will deliver your furniture.\n\nNext to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide many services for pets like daycare, boarding, and grooming. There are two small doctor's offices and a veterinary clinic in the town. They are well-equipped to help the people of Johnston.\n\nThe town has one elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. There are no parks in the town, but they are building a new recreational area to give people a place to go and attract new visitors.\n\nThe town is small and quiet. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice place to live, and you might not even notice it as you drive by.",
            "I heard about my place on a podcast about people who disappeared. It was a surprise. Almost all the apartments in the area were very expensive - over one thousand dollars a month. I never heard about this story before, and my friends didn't know it either. Maybe it's the struggle. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is hard, but we learned to be careful with money. You get used to the smell of old toys and old clothes. You smell less in adulthood. Some people smoke, or they just get used to things. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines is strong. It stays in the leather of a couch even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home where you can walk. If you start on one end, you can visit two stores that sell used things, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets in the morning. But in the second-hand stores, it is quiet. Many people pass by, but the stores are silent. It's a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, there are more cars and people in the city. It's growing, they say. One of the biggest companies that sells things online and delivers them is here. It's still not easy for the city. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals. No one usually asks for help. You can be alone and quiet, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where people care about each other. Here, you can keep to yourself for a long time. The city is lively. There's always music next door and singing upstairs. We have a small community here. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals together. I'm lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same. We bring mail to each other and help each other out. It's nice to see them, and I think they like having me around too. I live in a big city, but my neighbors make me feel like I didn't make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. Many houses here are the same. We have a homeowners association. It helps keep our homes nice. The front yards are all similar. They have small grass areas, decorative stones, and short driveways. Some people have small trees. Everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are well-maintained. You will not find holes in the road here. Most houses have one story, but some have two. We do not have individual mailboxes in front of each house. We use a big box at the end of the street. We need a key to use our box. There are also two big boxes for packages. This is because of the homeowners association.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. It is both a rural and suburban area. We have a lot of space. There are several community pools that we can use. They are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking paths. We can walk our dogs or go for a walk alone. You do not need to go to a park to get exercise. The neighborhood is big. We can walk or run around it and get exercise. Most people who live here are old. It is a safe area. People look out for each other. Some people who live here are middle-aged or young professionals. The city is big. It has a small-town feel. We have many things we need. We have a big mall. It is not very big, but it is enough. I drive 15 minutes to get to a big store. We have many stores with different kinds of food. We have expensive stores with healthy food and cheap stores with few things and few employees. My neighborhood is safe and nice. We have nice things like pools and walking paths. We are not close to stores, but we can drive to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not rich. Many people own or rent houses here. The houses are not very valuable. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when we walk down the street. Crime happens more often here than in other parts of town. There have been some bad incidents in the past ten years. One person was shot near a bar. But we have not been hurt. Sometimes things go missing from our porch when we forget to bring them inside. Our town has a big problem with a drug called fentanyl. Many people have died from taking it. But we have help for people who want to stop taking it. There are places where people can go to get better and learn to stop taking drugs.\n\nOur son's school is very good. The teachers and staff are kind. He has not been bullied because everyone is friendly. We have a group of parents who help the school. They plan fun activities to help families and the school get better. The school gives food to all students for free. This way, no child goes hungry. We pay little money for things like school supplies and field trips. Everyone is treated the same. The town is making some improvements. They are fixing roads and parks. But most of the good things are in the middle of town and on the west side. That is where the big stores are. We on the east side get less help. This makes some people unhappy. I like living here. People are friendly, the school is great, and we have many stores to buy things. Our house is not worth much, but it is okay. We have lived here for 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill with old buildings. I live in a seven-story apartment building near a historic theater. A block away is a small bar with games. Many people go there on warm summer nights. Sometimes, on weekends in June and July, people wait in line to get in. Close by is a big park. It is special because of its location. The park is surrounded by concrete with stairs. In the cold winter, some people sleep in tents near the park. They stay close together to keep warm. They are near a place where they can take showers. I love my city. It is not just the old buildings that are special. It is the people who live here. This area used to be very violent. Many years ago, the government tried to make the streets safe. The people remember those days. They work hard to keep the area clean. They still care about what happens in their neighborhood. Some people warn me, a white person, not to walk around at night. I think this is because of what happened in the past. Maybe I am able to pass as a local because I am a mix of different cultures. I know that no matter where I go, this neighborhood is my home. I feel happy when I walk around at night. People here are kind to me. They have helped me in difficult situations. This is a place where people see the good in others. They make me feel valued and beautiful.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a rural area. The town is near big lakes. There are two big lakes near my house. One is called Lake Michigan and the other is Lake Charlevoix. I can see these lakes from my home. Many people visit these lakes to swim.\n\nMy town is small. I need a car to get to most places. There are no big shopping centers or big stores. The houses in my neighborhood are old. Some of them are being fixed up. Most of the houses have basements. You can see the basements from the street. The houses are different from each other. They are not the same. The houses have yards. Some people put up fences for their animals. They plant flowers and trees in their yards.\n\nThe people in my town are good workers. They work hard to make a living. Many of them have families. You can see children playing in the streets. People walk their dogs and ride their bikes. Neighbors know each other. They say hello to each other.\n\nThe lawns are well taken care of. The grass is cut and the bushes are trimmed. The town is quiet and peaceful. It is a good place to live. There is a police station near my house. There is also a health center and a place where people can take things to be recycled. We have a baseball field near my house. You can hear the announcers calling the game. There is a small airport near the baseball field. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. I can walk to get ice cream from a store near my house. It is a good place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a big city. The neighborhood is very different. Residential areas are not close together. They are between commercial areas. Commercial areas have many businesses. Some businesses are offices. Others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are a lot of new restaurants to eat at and stores to shop in. Some stores are big and well-known. They are part of big companies. Small stores are also popular. They are in shopping centers or on streets. The streets are close to quiet neighborhoods.\n\nThere are two parks near my home. People often take their young children to these parks. My neighborhood is very diverse. There is a community of people who like men and women in the same sex. There is also a Jewish community. Some people in my neighborhood came from the Soviet Union. There are many people in the city from different countries and races. Some groups of people live in their own communities. For example, we have Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These communities are not far from my neighborhood.\n\nHowever, the city is big and driving can be difficult. It takes a long time to drive a short distance. Many people do not walk. They use cars. The city has a lot of traffic. It is hard to find a parking spot. There are many new buildings being built in the city. Many people are moving to the city. Some people do not like this.\n\nThere are many kinds of houses in my city. Not all people live in big buildings. There are houses of different sizes and smaller buildings. Some houses have one family. Others have two families. This is true in my neighborhood too. People of different ages live in my neighborhood. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not a close community. But I remember playing with my next-door neighbor and other friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are single family homes, but some have been divided into two separate units. My home has a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. The houses look like they did in the past, when living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream seemed to bring people together, but now it seems to be fading away. My neighborhood still looks nice, but it is not as strong as it used to be. The people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards do not look as nice as they used to. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside as if the world is their only place. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks modern and makes young people dream of the future. The older residents feel happy when they remember the past. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are always full. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a big family from Yemen. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. Most people have lived here for a long time and know each other. There was a karate school, but it closed when kids stopped practicing karate. Now it is a pharmacy. People take medicine to feel better. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it, but older people enjoy it. There is one highway that goes through our town. We do not have an exit or entrance. We tried to get one, but older people said it would ruin our town. They told the city council to say no. We are building a new school and we are choosing a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be a good choice.",
            "You might miss this area at first glance. It is a residential area behind a shopping strip. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods, you will find a community. There are apartment buildings. They are next to each other, like Russian nesting dolls.\n\nSome of these buildings have had problems. They have been in the news. But the other buildings are different. They are a quiet world that not many people know about. Across from these buildings is a community college. Students go there every day. The road beside the college is a residential road. There is a park on one side. It has grass and flowers. Children play there. Some people walk dogs there. \n\nThere is a place to eat sushi in a strip mall. It is near the park. There is also a store to buy swimming supplies. And a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool and get a manicure at the same time. There is a place for frozen yogurt too. Teenagers like to eat there and do tricks on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a part of America. It is quiet and unchanging. It is like a piece of history.",
            "We were driving through a big area with many corn fields. She had never seen so much open space before. She was used to living in a town with a store just a short walk from her house. \"Where is everything?\" she asked. I said, \"This is it!\"\n\nShe was surprised by the many corn fields. I told her about growing up in a rural area of Ohio. This helped her understand where I was from. We were driving on a two-lane road. There was a big hole in the ground filled with water. After that, we came to a small area where people live.\n\nThe houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land. People are very proud of their yards. In the spring, many flowers and trees grow. The trees change with the seasons. The driveways have very nice cars. Many of them are Mercedes Benz. They shine in the sun after they are washed.\n\nAs we continued driving, I saw my neighbor. He is from Korea. He is always outside, mowing his lawn. He sings while he works. Everyone likes him. He used to be a doctor. He is now older and not as funny as he used to be. He likes to hide behind his grass and lawn mower.\n\nWe finally came to my house. There are many geese in the yard. My dog chases them. There is a small stream in the back. You can hear frogs, the stream, and sometimes a cow from a nearby farm. Across a small bridge, there is a special area with natural trees, herbs, and flowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and chased animals. I had many friends.\n\nIn the winter, it can be very cold here. But it is also very beautiful. The trees look like skeletons when they don't have leaves. When it snows, the yard looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We also made forts out of branches and snowballs. We used them to fight each other. We had a lot of fun playing in the snow.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that likes to call itself weird. This is shown on a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and a place that pushes the law. The sign says \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some people think this is a call to remember the city from the 1990s and early 2000s. Back then, Portland was less known and less expensive. It was a place where creative people lived and made new ideas.\n\nNow, more people are moving to Portland. They are mostly from California. The city is building many new homes for them. But Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean we do not have modern things. We buy most of our things from other countries. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. We also have normal things like other cities.\n\nWeird means we do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, people have colorful houses and gardens with flowers, herbs, and food. In the summer, people put boxes on the street with free things in them. These boxes have clothes, books, and sometimes other things. This is part of what Portland is about.\n\nPortland is a city of many different kinds of people. Some people do goat yoga, which is yoga with real goats. Others go to soccer matches. We have people who pursue their dreams and others who dream about pursuing their dreams while they are at the bar.\n\nPortland has problems. Many people in the city have mental health problems. The weather in Portland is often rainy and gray, which can make people feel sad. We also have a problem with people who do not have homes. The city offers many services to help them, but they are not enough.\n\nMost people in Portland do not know what to do about the homeless problem. Some people feel sorry for them, while others are angry. Portland is like many other cities with this problem.",
            "I look out at the mountains in the north. They are always there. They see the sun every morning and every evening. No matter how busy I am, they are always there. When I am stressed, they remind me to look at them. They give me strength to go on, one day at a time. I came to this town when I started college. The mountains near campus caught my eye. The university is nice with its buildings and ponds. But the mountains are special. The town is also nice. There are many cafes with good coffee. You can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. The old buildings there are interesting. They make the town feel old and new at the same time. This is what makes this town so special. You can find peace and excitement in the same place. I have many happy memories in this town. I remember walking past the swings in the park with my friends after a long night of studying. I also remember running through downtown to see a movie. But this town can also be sad. We all have bad memories sometimes. The ponds can be a good place to think and feel sad. I have sat by the pond many times feeling sad. I watch the animals living their lives and wonder about my own life. I think about my purpose. I walk past the houses and trees and reach the main street. The sun is shining on the palm trees and the sky is blue and yellow. I look up and see the mountains. They are still there. They remind me to be strong.",
            "If you want to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you can do so easily. Many people use public transportation in New York City, and it is very accessible. Bensonhurst is a busy neighborhood. You will feel like you are in New York City. You will see many Asian stores when you visit. Over the last twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. Because of this, you will see many Asian-owned stores. These stores sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, the prices are low, and it is convenient. There are many Asian stores near where I live. In fact, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk of each other. This makes it easy to buy food.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for Asian people. It is a mixed neighborhood with people from many countries and their children. Many businesses in the area are Asian-owned. There is also a park near where I live. The park has many basketball courts, a big field for sports, and a water fountain for kids to play in during the summer.\n\nNew York City has many parks like this one. They are good places for people to play together. In Bensonhurst, there are not many big office buildings. Most of the houses are co-op living or condominium apartments. Many people live in two-family houses. The people here are generally nice, but it can be loud. You may hear music from cars driving by or people speeding on their way to work. If you visit at night, you should be careful. Bensonhurst is a safe neighborhood, but some people can be mean. I have had problems in the past, but it was a long time ago. Recently, some people in the neighborhood have taken packages from each other's homes. People also do not clean up after their dogs as they should. You may see dog waste on the street when you go to the train station or the supermarket. This is my biggest complaint about Bensonhurst.",
            "I live in a neighborhood without many sidewalks. My house is at the top of a big hill. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many runners go there for exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street. Everyone walks on the road. The road is not very good. It has holes and can be hard to drive on. The power lines along the street are old and broken. They get hit by branches and leaves when it rains. Many tall trees are around my neighborhood. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. The houses on the hill are high up and have big windows to see the ocean. It is beautiful to see the ocean at sunset. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything. I left my car in the driveway for a month and it got covered with moss. It took me a long time to clean it off. There are not many children in my neighborhood. The school is near, but most people are old. They have dogs instead of kids. If you leave your door open, dogs can get in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. There are many wild rabbits in the area. They dig up plants and make holes in the lawns. My cats like to chase them. We also have many birds. There are small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks and eagles fly by. The neighborhood crows chase them away. There are no stores near me, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that sell fresh seafood. There is no beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side on most days.",
            "I live in a quiet neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. The street is between two state highways, so we have some traffic. But it is not too much. I know most of the people who live here. They are busy with yard work and other things. In winter, we go sledding on the hill on our street. I live in a house at the corner. I see everyone who comes and goes. Whenever we see a strange car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. I work from home. I have a wife and two daughters, eleven and fourteen years old. We go outside and play. We also grill on our deck. It is a nice smell. People cut grass every day from March to October. We have many trees, so it is cool and shady. We have to rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. This year, it feels like fall is very long because we don't have a lot of winter. Our garage is in the back of our house. I like to work on my truck and other things in the garage. When the garage door is open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet. We have visitors during Thanksgiving and Christmas. I like living here. If the street were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My home is in a desert area. It is very hot and dry. There is a lot of dirt. If you have not lived here, you might not know what it is like to see only brown everywhere. When I first lived here, the houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses being built. It looks like a city, but it is still a desert area. Most people are friendly, but like any city, it has good and bad parts. I like my neighborhood. It is nice. The stores in my area are mostly big chain stores like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. The most common jobs in my town are construction. Many buildings are being built. This worries me. I like it the way it is now. I moved from a big city, and I do not want to go back. My job is in the construction area. I install drywall and T-bar. I like living here because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has hard conditions, but it is home to different kinds of animals. We should learn about these animals to live with them safely. My family and I have learned to live with the animals. My children like lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. If you visit, you can go to the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun. You can also go to the nearby Wrightwood and see the snow-covered mountains. If you like history and science, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has rocks, bones, and objects from the past.",
            "I live in a neighborhood, but it is not like other neighborhoods. My neighborhood is the college campus where I live. I stay in a dormitory with other students. I also think of the people who live in my dormitory as my community. The campus is also my neighborhood, but not as much. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's talk about the houses in my neighborhood. There are three types of houses. First, there are apartments. In these apartments, 2-4 people share a room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. This means about 20 people live in each building. Second, there are houses that people can rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms and usually have alumni living in them. There are not many of these houses. Finally, there are dorm rooms. These rooms usually have 2 people sharing a space, except in some cases. This is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people in my neighborhood. My school values diversity. Many different cultures and ages live here. The staff lives in the houses, and the newer students live in dorms, and the older students live in apartments. We have many stores and a park in our neighborhood. The stores have food, clothes, and other things we need. We also have a park where everyone can play. The park is clean and safe because everyone in my neighborhood helps to take care of it.",
            "I have lived in my neighborhood for about 10 years. I was sad when I first came here. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and my friends. My family moved to this neighborhood for a better house and school. My mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my sister. At first, I did not like it here. But as time passed, I made new friends and acquaintances. I knew a few neighbors. There was Mr. Glen and his children. They were kind to me. I also knew Dennis, who lived next door. They were nice people. I felt close to them.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen's wedding with my family. It was a happy event. I met his daughter, Marsharii. We had a good time. I hope she is doing well now. The neighborhood can be confusing. But I have a GPS, so I can explore it. I like to go to the park and be near nature. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance by walking on sticks. Sometimes I bring my wooden sword and play with it. The neighborhood has a basketball court and a tennis court. But I do not play sports as much as I used to.\n\nMy dad taught me and my friend tennis. We had a good time with Mr. Graves. My dad made us practice hard, but we had fun. I have many happy memories of this neighborhood. There are many stories to tell. These are just a few of my favorites. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I like living near the college I attend. The college is close to my home. I walk to class most days. The area has many apartment buildings. Some buildings are old, but they are not very expensive. There are a few restaurants and bars nearby. These places are fun and not too expensive. One bar just changed its name. It is more expensive now, but the service and drinks are good. Most people in the area are nice. Some are college students, and others have lower incomes. The area has many children because there is an elementary school near my home. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My building manager put an air freshener near their door to prevent the smell. I and my boyfriend think this is funny. But it is also a little insulting.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but inside they are nice. Down the street, there are new apartments. But I do not like them. They are cheaply made, but the rent is high. This seems unfair. The new apartments are near the college, so the managers can charge high rent.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. The food is served on paper plates and is often microwaved. Across the street is a gas station. People say it is not a good place to work. However, the city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now the area looks nicer. My building has many trees. Some were cut down, but there are still many trees. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex.\n\nI live on 42nd street. The street behind my building is 43rd street. It is not as nice as 42nd street. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they hide the old buildings. There is a lot of crime on 43rd street. But I also think crime happens at other apartments across the street from me. I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many useful things nearby. I like that the college is close, and there are two bus stops near my home.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses. They are called duplexes. They are on a special street called a cul-de-sac. The houses look like separate homes. But they are connected. Each house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most people are friends with each other. They stand at the end of the street some evenings and talk. The small children in the neighborhood play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It is a nice break from a world with many machines and computers. It is like stepping back in time.\n\nThe neighborhood is surrounded by fields and trees. There are blue skies and white, fluffy clouds. But this time of year brings danger. We have to be careful of tornadoes. One day, we heard the sirens. We had to go to a safe place. I went to the bathtub with my little dog. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail. The road was hot and it made the hail melt quickly. After the storm, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared in the sky. I took a picture with my camera. The streets were quiet for a while. Then people came home from wherever they were when the storm hit. It was business as usual. People were outside while their dinners cooked.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I moved here from a place called New Hampshire. I like the way people talk in the South. Everyone in my building has a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. But not all the apartments are the same inside. Some are very small. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. I can see a pond, but it is not safe to swim in. I have seen deer and in the morning, I can hear a big frog singing. It is a great place to live, about 40 minutes from a big city called Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms around me. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I became close to a friend who lives two houses down from me and a guy who lives on my street. However, they do not live here anymore. The people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburbs. We have many two-story houses. On nice days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had any problems with my neighbors. I feel safe in this neighborhood. I have ordered packages online and they have never been stolen. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids in the neighborhood. I got hurt playing football, but I have more good memories than bad ones. Today, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. Thinking about the park makes me feel nostalgic. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find different kinds of food nearby. Within a short distance, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. There are also fast food places and pizza shops. We have many stores with everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store called Jewel-Osco. One store is owned by an Indian family. I like my neighborhood. It is nice to see how lucky I am compared to others who have problems with their neighbors.",
            "Johnston is a small town in South Carolina. It does not stand out from other towns, but it is important for farming. The town is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign at the town's entrance.\n\nMost of the town is farmland with peach trees or cows. Houses are far apart from each other. Many of them are two stories high and have metal roofs to keep the sun out. They are often not near the road, but are set back so that the front land can be used for animals or crops.\n\nIn the center of the town, there is one traffic light at a four-way stop. This is where you can find the town's stores. There are three places to buy fast food: a Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta, and a small burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizza store, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People know it for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There is also a small grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. It is the only grocery store in the town, but many people go to a bigger store in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries.\n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday things and is often busy. There is also a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in the town for a long time and has two men who will deliver your furniture.\n\nNext to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide many services for pets like daycare, boarding, and grooming. There are two small doctor's offices and a veterinary clinic in the town. They are well-equipped to help the people of Johnston.\n\nThe town has one elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. There are no parks in the town, but they are building a new recreational area to give people a place to go and attract new visitors.\n\nThe town is small and quiet. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice place to live, and you might not even notice it as you drive by.",
            "I heard about my place on a podcast about people who disappeared. It was a surprise. Almost all the apartments in the area were very expensive - over one thousand dollars a month. I never heard about this story before, and my friends didn't know it either. Maybe it's the struggle. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is hard, but we learned to be careful with money. You get used to the smell of old toys and old clothes. You smell less in adulthood. Some people smoke, or they just get used to things. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines is strong. It stays in the leather of a couch even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home where you can walk. If you start on one end, you can visit two stores that sell used things, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets in the morning. But in the second-hand stores, it is quiet. Many people pass by, but the stores are silent. It's a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, there are more cars and people in the city. It's growing, they say. One of the biggest companies that sells things online and delivers them is here. It's still not easy for the city. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals. No one usually asks for help. You can be alone and quiet, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where people care about each other. Here, you can keep to yourself for a long time. The city is lively. There's always music next door and singing upstairs. We have a small community here. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals together. I'm lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same. We bring mail to each other and help each other out. It's nice to see them, and I think they like having me around too. I live in a big city, but my neighbors make me feel like I didn't make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. Many houses here are the same. We have a homeowners association. It helps keep our homes nice. The front yards are all similar. They have small grass areas, decorative stones, and short driveways. Some people have small trees. Everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are well-maintained. You will not find holes in the road here. Most houses have one story, but some have two. We do not have individual mailboxes in front of each house. We use a big box at the end of the street. We need a key to use our box. There are also two big boxes for packages. This is because of the homeowners association.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. It is both a rural and suburban area. We have a lot of space. There are several community pools that we can use. They are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking paths. We can walk our dogs or go for a walk alone. You do not need to go to a park to get exercise. The neighborhood is big. We can walk or run around it and get exercise. Most people who live here are old. It is a safe area. People look out for each other. Some people who live here are middle-aged or young professionals. The city is big. It has a small-town feel. We have many things we need. We have a big mall. It is not very big, but it is enough. I drive 15 minutes to get to a big store. We have many stores with different kinds of food. We have expensive stores with healthy food and cheap stores with few things and few employees. My neighborhood is safe and nice. We have nice things like pools and walking paths. We are not close to stores, but we can drive to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not rich. Many people own or rent houses here. The houses are not very valuable. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when we walk down the street. Crime happens more often here than in other parts of town. There have been some bad incidents in the past ten years. One person was shot near a bar. But we have not been hurt. Sometimes things go missing from our porch when we forget to bring them inside. Our town has a big problem with a drug called fentanyl. Many people have died from taking it. But we have help for people who want to stop taking it. There are places where people can go to get better and learn to stop taking drugs.\n\nOur son's school is very good. The teachers and staff are kind. He has not been bullied because everyone is friendly. We have a group of parents who help the school. They plan fun activities to help families and the school get better. The school gives food to all students for free. This way, no child goes hungry. We pay little money for things like school supplies and field trips. Everyone is treated the same. The town is making some improvements. They are fixing roads and parks. But most of the good things are in the middle of town and on the west side. That is where the big stores are. We on the east side get less help. This makes some people unhappy. I like living here. People are friendly, the school is great, and we have many stores to buy things. Our house is not worth much, but it is okay. We have lived here for 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill with old buildings. I live in a seven-story apartment building near a historic theater. A block away is a small bar with games. Many people go there on warm summer nights. Sometimes, on weekends in June and July, people wait in line to get in. Close by is a big park. It is special because of its location. The park is surrounded by concrete with stairs. In the cold winter, some people sleep in tents near the park. They stay close together to keep warm. They are near a place where they can take showers. I love my city. It is not just the old buildings that are special. It is the people who live here. This area used to be very violent. Many years ago, the government tried to make the streets safe. The people remember those days. They work hard to keep the area clean. They still care about what happens in their neighborhood. Some people warn me, a white person, not to walk around at night. I think this is because of what happened in the past. Maybe I am able to pass as a local because I am a mix of different cultures. I know that no matter where I go, this neighborhood is my home. I feel happy when I walk around at night. People here are kind to me. They have helped me in difficult situations. This is a place where people see the good in others. They make me feel valued and beautiful.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a rural area. The town is near big lakes. There are two big lakes near my house. One is called Lake Michigan and the other is Lake Charlevoix. I can see these lakes from my home. Many people visit these lakes to swim.\n\nMy town is small. I need a car to get to most places. There are no big shopping centers or big stores. The houses in my neighborhood are old. Some of them are being fixed up. Most of the houses have basements. You can see the basements from the street. The houses are different from each other. They are not the same. The houses have yards. Some people put up fences for their animals. They plant flowers and trees in their yards.\n\nThe people in my town are good workers. They work hard to make a living. Many of them have families. You can see children playing in the streets. People walk their dogs and ride their bikes. Neighbors know each other. They say hello to each other.\n\nThe lawns are well taken care of. The grass is cut and the bushes are trimmed. The town is quiet and peaceful. It is a good place to live. There is a police station near my house. There is also a health center and a place where people can take things to be recycled. We have a baseball field near my house. You can hear the announcers calling the game. There is a small airport near the baseball field. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. I can walk to get ice cream from a store near my house. It is a good place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I live in a big city. The neighborhood is very different. Residential areas are not close together. They are between commercial areas. Commercial areas have many businesses. Some businesses are offices. Others are stores, restaurants, and places to have fun. There are a lot of new restaurants to eat at and stores to shop in. Some stores are big and well-known. They are part of big companies. Small stores are also popular. They are in shopping centers or on streets. The streets are close to quiet neighborhoods.\n\nThere are two parks near my home. People often take their young children to these parks. My neighborhood is very diverse. There is a community of people who like men and women in the same sex. There is also a Jewish community. Some people in my neighborhood came from the Soviet Union. There are many people in the city from different countries and races. Some groups of people live in their own communities. For example, we have Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These communities are not far from my neighborhood.\n\nHowever, the city is big and driving can be difficult. It takes a long time to drive a short distance. Many people do not walk. They use cars. The city has a lot of traffic. It is hard to find a parking spot. There are many new buildings being built in the city. Many people are moving to the city. Some people do not like this.\n\nThere are many kinds of houses in my city. Not all people live in big buildings. There are houses of different sizes and smaller buildings. Some houses have one family. Others have two families. This is true in my neighborhood too. People of different ages live in my neighborhood. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not a close community. But I remember playing with my next-door neighbor and other friends when I was a child.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most houses are single family homes, but some have been divided into two separate units. My home has a small front yard and a driveway on the left side. The houses look like they did in the past, when living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream seemed to bring people together, but now it seems to be fading away. My neighborhood still looks nice, but it is not as strong as it used to be. The people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards do not look as nice as they used to. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside as if the world is their only place. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks modern and makes young people dream of the future. The older residents feel happy when they remember the past. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are always full. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a big family from Yemen. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide and children play football. Most people have lived here for a long time and know each other. There was a karate school, but it closed when kids stopped practicing karate. Now it is a pharmacy. People take medicine to feel better. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it, but older people enjoy it. There is one highway that goes through our town. We do not have an exit or entrance. We tried to get one, but older people said it would ruin our town. They told the city council to say no. We are building a new school and we are choosing a symbol for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a cabin would be a good choice.",
            "You might miss this area at first glance. It is a residential area behind a shopping strip. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods, you will find a community. There are apartment buildings. They are next to each other, like Russian nesting dolls.\n\nSome of these buildings have had problems. They have been in the news. But the other buildings are different. They are a quiet world that not many people know about. Across from these buildings is a community college. Students go there every day. The road beside the college is a residential road. There is a park on one side. It has grass and flowers. Children play there. Some people walk dogs there. \n\nThere is a place to eat sushi in a strip mall. It is near the park. There is also a store to buy swimming supplies. And a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool and get a manicure at the same time. There is a place for frozen yogurt too. Teenagers like to eat there and do tricks on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a part of America. It is quiet and unchanging. It is like a piece of history.",
            "We were driving through a big area with many corn fields. She had never seen so much open space before. She was used to living in a town with a store just a short walk from her house. \"Where is everything?\" she asked. I said, \"This is it!\"\n\nShe was surprised by the many corn fields. I told her about growing up in a rural area of Ohio. This helped her understand where I was from. We were driving on a two-lane road. There was a big hole in the ground filled with water. After that, we came to a small area where people live.\n\nThe houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big piece of land. People are very proud of their yards. In the spring, many flowers and trees grow. The trees change with the seasons. The driveways have very nice cars. Many of them are Mercedes Benz. They shine in the sun after they are washed.\n\nAs we continued driving, I saw my neighbor. He is from Korea. He is always outside, mowing his lawn. He sings while he works. Everyone likes him. He used to be a doctor. He is now older and not as funny as he used to be. He likes to hide behind his grass and lawn mower.\n\nWe finally came to my house. There are many geese in the yard. My dog chases them. There is a small stream in the back. You can hear frogs, the stream, and sometimes a cow from a nearby farm. Across a small bridge, there is a special area with natural trees, herbs, and flowers. This is where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and chased animals. I had many friends.\n\nIn the winter, it can be very cold here. But it is also very beautiful. The trees look like skeletons when they don't have leaves. When it snows, the yard looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We also made forts out of branches and snowballs. We used them to fight each other. We had a lot of fun playing in the snow.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city that likes to call itself weird. This is shown on a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, and a place that pushes the law. The sign says \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some people think this is a call to remember the city from the 1990s and early 2000s. Back then, Portland was less known and less expensive. It was a place where creative people lived and made new ideas.\n\nNow, more people are moving to Portland. They are mostly from California. The city is building many new homes for them. But Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean we do not have modern things. We buy most of our things from other countries. Portland has yoga, hipsters, and business people. We also have normal things like other cities.\n\nWeird means we do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, people have colorful houses and gardens with flowers, herbs, and food. In the summer, people put boxes on the street with free things in them. These boxes have clothes, books, and sometimes other things. This is part of what Portland is about.\n\nPortland is a city of many different kinds of people. Some people do goat yoga, which is yoga with real goats. Others go to soccer matches. We have people who pursue their dreams and others who dream about pursuing their dreams while they are at the bar.\n\nPortland has problems. Many people in the city have mental health problems. The weather in Portland is often rainy and gray, which can make people feel sad. We also have a problem with people who do not have homes. The city offers many services to help them, but they are not enough.\n\nMost people in Portland do not know what to do about the homeless problem. Some people feel sorry for them, while others are angry. Portland is like many other cities with this problem.",
            "I look out at the mountains in the north. They are always there. They see the sun every morning and every evening. No matter how busy I am, they are always there. When I am stressed, they remind me to look at them. They give me strength to go on, one day at a time. I came to this town when I started college. The mountains near campus caught my eye. The university is nice with its buildings and ponds. But the mountains are special. The town is also nice. There are many cafes with good coffee. You can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. The old buildings there are interesting. They make the town feel old and new at the same time. This is what makes this town so special. You can find peace and excitement in the same place. I have many happy memories in this town. I remember walking past the swings in the park with my friends after a long night of studying. I also remember running through downtown to see a movie. But this town can also be sad. We all have bad memories sometimes. The ponds can be a good place to think and feel sad. I have sat by the pond many times feeling sad. I watch the animals living their lives and wonder about my own life. I think about my purpose. I walk past the houses and trees and reach the main street. The sun is shining on the palm trees and the sky is blue and yellow. I look up and see the mountains. They are still there. They remind me to be strong.",
            "If you want to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you can do so easily. Many people use public transportation in New York City, and it is very accessible. Bensonhurst is a busy neighborhood. You will feel like you are in New York City. You will see many Asian stores when you visit. Over the last twenty years, many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst. Because of this, you will see many Asian-owned stores. These stores sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, the prices are low, and it is convenient. There are many Asian stores near where I live. In fact, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk of each other. This makes it easy to buy food.\n\nBensonhurst is not just for Asian people. It is a mixed neighborhood with people from many countries and their children. Many businesses in the area are Asian-owned. There is also a park near where I live. The park has many basketball courts, a big field for sports, and a water fountain for kids to play in during the summer.\n\nNew York City has many parks like this one. They are good places for people to play together. In Bensonhurst, there are not many big office buildings. Most of the houses are co-op living or condominium apartments. Many people live in two-family houses. The people here are generally nice, but it can be loud. You may hear music from cars driving by or people speeding on their way to work. If you visit at night, you should be careful. Bensonhurst is a safe neighborhood, but some people can be mean. I have had problems in the past, but it was a long time ago. Recently, some people in the neighborhood have taken packages from each other's homes. People also do not clean up after their dogs as they should. You may see dog waste on the street when you go to the train station or the supermarket. This is my biggest complaint about Bensonhurst.",
            "I live in a neighborhood without many sidewalks. My house is at the top of a big hill. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many runners go there for exercise. There are no sidewalks on my street. Everyone walks on the road. The road is not very good. It has holes and can be hard to drive on. The power lines along the street are old and broken. They get hit by branches and leaves when it rains. Many tall trees are around my neighborhood. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. The houses on the hill are high up and have big windows to see the ocean. It is beautiful to see the ocean at sunset. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything. I left my car in the driveway for a month and it got covered with moss. It took me a long time to clean it off. There are not many children in my neighborhood. The school is near, but most people are old. They have dogs instead of kids. If you leave your door open, dogs can get in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. There are many wild rabbits in the area. They dig up plants and make holes in the lawns. My cats like to chase them. We also have many birds. There are small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks and eagles fly by. The neighborhood crows chase them away. There are no stores near me, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that sell fresh seafood. There is no beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side on most days.",
            "I live in a quiet neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. The street is between two state highways, so we have some traffic. But it is not too much. I know most of the people who live here. They are busy with yard work and other things. In winter, we go sledding on the hill on our street. I live in a house at the corner. I see everyone who comes and goes. Whenever we see a strange car, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. I work from home. I have a wife and two daughters, eleven and fourteen years old. We go outside and play. We also grill on our deck. It is a nice smell. People cut grass every day from March to October. We have many trees, so it is cool and shady. We have to rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. This year, it feels like fall is very long because we don't have a lot of winter. Our garage is in the back of our house. I like to work on my truck and other things in the garage. When the garage door is open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet. We have visitors during Thanksgiving and Christmas. I like living here. If the street were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "My home is in a desert area. It is very hot and dry. There is a lot of dirt. If you have not lived here, you might not know what it is like to see only brown everywhere. When I first lived here, the houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses being built. It looks like a city, but it is still a desert area. Most people are friendly, but like any city, it has good and bad parts. I like my neighborhood. It is nice. The stores in my area are mostly big chain stores like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. The most common jobs in my town are construction. Many buildings are being built. This worries me. I like it the way it is now. I moved from a big city, and I do not want to go back. My job is in the construction area. I install drywall and T-bar. I like living here because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert has hard conditions, but it is home to different kinds of animals. We should learn about these animals to live with them safely. My family and I have learned to live with the animals. My children like lizards and desert bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them. If you visit, you can go to the San Bernardino County Fair. It is fun. You can also go to the nearby Wrightwood and see the snow-covered mountains. If you like history and science, visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has rocks, bones, and objects from the past.",
            "I live in a neighborhood, but it is not like other neighborhoods. My neighborhood is the college campus where I live. I stay in a dormitory with other students. I also think of the people who live in my dormitory as my community. The campus is also my neighborhood, but not as much. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods in some ways. It has houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's talk about the houses in my neighborhood. There are three types of houses. First, there are apartments. In these apartments, 2-4 people share a room, and there are 4-6 rooms on each floor. This means about 20 people live in each building. Second, there are houses that people can rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms and usually have alumni living in them. There are not many of these houses. Finally, there are dorm rooms. These rooms usually have 2 people sharing a space, except in some cases. This is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. Now, let's talk about the people in my neighborhood. My school values diversity. Many different cultures and ages live here. The staff lives in the houses, and the newer students live in dorms, and the older students live in apartments. We have many stores and a park in our neighborhood. The stores have food, clothes, and other things we need. We also have a park where everyone can play. The park is clean and safe because everyone in my neighborhood helps to take care of it.",
            "I have lived in my neighborhood for about 10 years. I was sad when I first came here. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and my friends. My family moved to this neighborhood for a better house and school. My mom and dad wanted a better life for me and my sister. At first, I did not like it here. But as time passed, I made new friends and acquaintances. I knew a few neighbors. There was Mr. Glen and his children. They were kind to me. I also knew Dennis, who lived next door. They were nice people. I felt close to them.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen's wedding with my family. It was a happy event. I met his daughter, Marsharii. We had a good time. I hope she is doing well now. The neighborhood can be confusing. But I have a GPS, so I can explore it. I like to go to the park and be near nature. It makes me feel calm. I also like to practice my balance by walking on sticks. Sometimes I bring my wooden sword and play with it. The neighborhood has a basketball court and a tennis court. But I do not play sports as much as I used to.\n\nMy dad taught me and my friend tennis. We had a good time with Mr. Graves. My dad made us practice hard, but we had fun. I have many happy memories of this neighborhood. There are many stories to tell. These are just a few of my favorites. I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I like living near the college I attend. The college is close to my home. I walk to class most days. The area has many apartment buildings. Some buildings are old, but they are not very expensive. There are a few restaurants and bars nearby. These places are fun and not too expensive. One bar just changed its name. It is more expensive now, but the service and drinks are good. Most people in the area are nice. Some are college students, and others have lower incomes. The area has many children because there is an elementary school near my home. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My building manager put an air freshener near their door to prevent the smell. I and my boyfriend think this is funny. But it is also a little insulting.\n\nThe buildings around me are old, but inside they are nice. Down the street, there are new apartments. But I do not like them. They are cheaply made, but the rent is high. This seems unfair. The new apartments are near the college, so the managers can charge high rent.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. The food is served on paper plates and is often microwaved. Across the street is a gas station. People say it is not a good place to work. However, the city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now the area looks nicer. My building has many trees. Some were cut down, but there are still many trees. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex.\n\nI live on 42nd street. The street behind my building is 43rd street. It is not as nice as 42nd street. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they hide the old buildings. There is a lot of crime on 43rd street. But I also think crime happens at other apartments across the street from me. I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many useful things nearby. I like that the college is close, and there are two bus stops near my home.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses. They are called duplexes. They are on a special street called a cul-de-sac. The houses look like separate homes. But they are connected. Each house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most people are friends with each other. They stand at the end of the street some evenings and talk. The small children in the neighborhood play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It is a nice break from a world with many machines and computers. It is like stepping back in time.\n\nThe neighborhood is surrounded by fields and trees. There are blue skies and white, fluffy clouds. But this time of year brings danger. We have to be careful of tornadoes. One day, we heard the sirens. We had to go to a safe place. I went to the bathtub with my little dog. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail. The road was hot and it made the hail melt quickly. After the storm, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow appeared in the sky. I took a picture with my camera. The streets were quiet for a while. Then people came home from wherever they were when the storm hit. It was business as usual. People were outside while their dinners cooked.\n\nI like my neighborhood. I moved here from a place called New Hampshire. I like the way people talk in the South. Everyone in my building has a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. But not all the apartments are the same inside. Some are very small. I like to walk in a big field behind my house. I can see a pond, but it is not safe to swim in. I have seen deer and in the morning, I can hear a big frog singing. It is a great place to live, about 40 minutes from a big city called Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms around me. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I became close to a friend who lives two houses down from me and a guy who lives on my street. However, they do not live here anymore. The people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburbs. We have many two-story houses. On nice days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most of the time. I have never had any problems with my neighbors. I feel safe in this neighborhood. I have ordered packages online and they have never been stolen. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids in the neighborhood. I got hurt playing football, but I have more good memories than bad ones. Today, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. Thinking about the park makes me feel nostalgic. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find different kinds of food nearby. Within a short distance, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. There are also fast food places and pizza shops. We have many stores with everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store called Jewel-Osco. One store is owned by an Indian family. I like my neighborhood. It is nice to see how lucky I am compared to others who have problems with their neighbors.",
            "Johnston is a small town in South Carolina. It does not stand out from other towns, but it is important for farming. The town is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign at the town's entrance.\n\nMost of the town is farmland with peach trees or cows. Houses are far apart from each other. Many of them are two stories high and have metal roofs to keep the sun out. They are often not near the road, but are set back so that the front land can be used for animals or crops.\n\nIn the center of the town, there is one traffic light at a four-way stop. This is where you can find the town's stores. There are three places to buy fast food: a Chinese restaurant called Hong Kong, a Mexican restaurant called Fiesta, and a small burger place called Gary's. There used to be a pizza store, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. People know it for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There is also a small grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. It is the only grocery store in the town, but many people go to a bigger store in Batesburg-Leesville to buy most of their groceries.\n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many everyday things and is often busy. There is also a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in the town for a long time and has two men who will deliver your furniture.\n\nNext to the furniture store is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide many services for pets like daycare, boarding, and grooming. There are two small doctor's offices and a veterinary clinic in the town. They are well-equipped to help the people of Johnston.\n\nThe town has one elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. When students finish fifth grade, they go to school in the next town. There are no parks in the town, but they are building a new recreational area to give people a place to go and attract new visitors.\n\nThe town is small and quiet. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice place to live, and you might not even notice it as you drive by.",
            "I heard about my place on a podcast about people who disappeared. It was a surprise. Almost all the apartments in the area were very expensive - over one thousand dollars a month. I never heard about this story before, and my friends didn't know it either. Maybe it's the struggle. I know some of my friends cry at night. Life is hard, but we learned to be careful with money. You get used to the smell of old toys and old clothes. You smell less in adulthood. Some people smoke, or they just get used to things. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines is strong. It stays in the leather of a couch even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home where you can walk. If you start on one end, you can visit two stores that sell used things, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets in the morning. But in the second-hand stores, it is quiet. Many people pass by, but the stores are silent. It's a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, there are more cars and people in the city. It's growing, they say. One of the biggest companies that sells things online and delivers them is here. It's still not easy for the city. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own goals. No one usually asks for help. You can be alone and quiet, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where people care about each other. Here, you can keep to yourself for a long time. The city is lively. There's always music next door and singing upstairs. We have a small community here. We help each other when we need it. We celebrate birthdays and funerals together. I'm lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to clean after myself and leave food for them, and they do the same. We bring mail to each other and help each other out. It's nice to see them, and I think they like having me around too. I live in a big city, but my neighbors make me feel like I didn't make a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. Many houses here are the same. We have a homeowners association. It helps keep our homes nice. The front yards are all similar. They have small grass areas, decorative stones, and short driveways. Some people have small trees. Everyone has a two-car garage. The roads are well-maintained. You will not find holes in the road here. Most houses have one story, but some have two. We do not have individual mailboxes in front of each house. We use a big box at the end of the street. We need a key to use our box. There are also two big boxes for packages. This is because of the homeowners association.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. It is both a rural and suburban area. We have a lot of space. There are several community pools that we can use. They are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking paths. We can walk our dogs or go for a walk alone. You do not need to go to a park to get exercise. The neighborhood is big. We can walk or run around it and get exercise. Most people who live here are old. It is a safe area. People look out for each other. Some people who live here are middle-aged or young professionals. The city is big. It has a small-town feel. We have many things we need. We have a big mall. It is not very big, but it is enough. I drive 15 minutes to get to a big store. We have many stores with different kinds of food. We have expensive stores with healthy food and cheap stores with few things and few employees. My neighborhood is safe and nice. We have nice things like pools and walking paths. We are not close to stores, but we can drive to any store we want.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. It is not rich. Many people own or rent houses here. The houses are not very valuable. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when we walk down the street. Crime happens more often here than in other parts of town. There have been some bad incidents in the past ten years. One person was shot near a bar. But we have not been hurt. Sometimes things go missing from our porch when we forget to bring them inside. Our town has a big problem with a drug called fentanyl. Many people have died from taking it. But we have help for people who want to stop taking it. There are places where people can go to get better and learn to stop taking drugs.\n\nOur son's school is very good. The teachers and staff are kind. He has not been bullied because everyone is friendly. We have a group of parents who help the school. They plan fun activities to help families and the school get better. The school gives food to all students for free. This way, no child goes hungry. We pay little money for things like school supplies and field trips. Everyone is treated the same. The town is making some improvements. They are fixing roads and parks. But most of the good things are in the middle of town and on the west side. That is where the big stores are. We on the east side get less help. This makes some people unhappy. I like living here. People are friendly, the school is great, and we have many stores to buy things. Our house is not worth much, but it is okay. We have lived here for 16 years. We do not want to live anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill with old buildings. I live in a seven-story apartment building near a historic theater. A block away is a small bar with games. Many people go there on warm summer nights. Sometimes, on weekends in June and July, people wait in line to get in. Close by is a big park. It is special because of its location. The park is surrounded by concrete with stairs. In the cold winter, some people sleep in tents near the park. They stay close together to keep warm. They are near a place where they can take showers. I love my city. It is not just the old buildings that are special. It is the people who live here. This area used to be very violent. Many years ago, the government tried to make the streets safe. The people remember those days. They work hard to keep the area clean. They still care about what happens in their neighborhood. Some people warn me, a white person, not to walk around at night. I think this is because of what happened in the past. Maybe I am able to pass as a local because I am a mix of different cultures. I know that no matter where I go, this neighborhood is my home. I feel happy when I walk around at night. People here are kind to me. They have helped me in difficult situations. This is a place where people see the good in others. They make me feel valued and beautiful.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a rural area. The town is near big lakes. There are two big lakes near my house. One is called Lake Michigan and the other is Lake Charlevoix. I can see these lakes from my home. Many people visit these lakes to swim.\n\nMy town is small. I need a car to get to most places. There are no big shopping centers or big stores. The houses in my neighborhood are old. Some of them are being fixed up. Most of the houses have basements. You can see the basements from the street. The houses are different from each other. They are not the same. The houses have yards. Some people put up fences for their animals. They plant flowers and trees in their yards.\n\nThe people in my town are good workers. They work hard to make a living. Many of them have families. You can see children playing in the streets. People walk their dogs and ride their bikes. Neighbors know each other. They say hello to each other.\n\nThe lawns are well taken care of. The grass is cut and the bushes are trimmed. The town is quiet and peaceful. It is a good place to live. There is a police station near my house. There is also a health center and a place where people can take things to be recycled. We have a baseball field near my house. You can hear the announcers calling the game. There is a small airport near the baseball field. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. I can walk to get ice cream from a store near my house. It is a good place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

My house has a small front yard and a small driveway to the side. Most houses look like the past. Living in the suburbs was once a great dream in America. But now, that dream is not as strong. My neighborhood still shows us the dream is still alive. Many people still visit and live here. The people are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as much.

            "You might not notice it at first. It looks just like a normal residential area behind a shopping strip. Not a place you would think people would want to live, right? But if you walk behind the old, empty store and look behind the hotels, you'll find a busy community. There are small apartment buildings next to each other, like blocks in a row. The first buildings you see have been in the news for some problems. Let's not talk too much about those. The other buildings are a different story. They are not well known to people who live in this area.\n\nNext to these buildings is a college. It's a small campus where students go to learn. They come in early in the morning, carrying coffee and yawning. A big gate opens slowly to let them in. People driving by on the road get angry when the gate blocks the way. The road meets another street with a park and a building where people go to get better after they hurt themselves. The building has nice chairs on the porch and a big fan that moves the hot air around. Children play in the park, running and spinning around. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Older people take their dogs for walks on the path. They look at the teenagers on skateboards and the girls talking by the playground. There is a store that sells sushi in a shopping center near the park. It's cheap but never too busy. There's a store that sells pool supplies next to it, and a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken. That's the beauty of a shopping center. There's also a place that sells frozen yogurt. You can see the teenagers in the park with cold yogurt and toppings, doing tricks on their skateboards. This is a typical American neighborhood.

            "We drove past many corn fields. They went on and on as far as the eye could see. \"Where is everything?\" she asked. I knew she was surprised by the empty space. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her house. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. I showed her a big lake with water. Near it was my home in a small group of houses. They were made of brick and stucco. Each house had a lot of land.

            "Portland, Oregon is a city with a special feeling. The city says its unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some people think this is a reminder of the past, when Portland was less known and less expensive. In those times, the city was home to many new and creative ideas. Others see it as a welcome to people who are different. They can be weird and be praised for it. Even though many new and rich people have moved to Portland, it is still a weird place. \"Weird\" does not mean everyone is free to do whatever they want. But it means people are accepting of things that others might not accept. Portland has modern things like other cities. People buy things made in China. There are many normal things in Portland, like yoga and hipsters and business people. Perhaps the weird thing about Portland is that people do not take these things too seriously. My neighborhood has colorful houses and flower gardens. There are free boxes along the street in the summer. Free boxes are boxes with things people are getting rid of. They can have clothes, books or anything. The fun of finding something new and interesting in a free box is part of what makes Portland special. But Portland is not perfect. It has problems like many other cities. There are people who do not like to accept things that are different. They like to do new and fun things like goat yoga or watch the local soccer team. Portland is full of people with different interests and passions. Some people are trying to make their dreams come true, while others are just enjoying the city. Portland also has problems with drugs and homelessness. These problems are not easy to solve. The city has good services for people in need, but they are not enough.

It feels like New York City. You will see many Asian stores. In the last twenty years, many Asian people moved to Bensonhurt. Now, you see an Asian store on almost every street. They sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, it costs less money, and it is easy to get.\n\nThere are many Asian supermarkets close to me.

            "I live in a place without sidewalks. My house is on the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"exercise hill\" because many joggers like to run up it every day. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is not good and can be hard to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires are old and look bad. The area gets a lot of rain and wind, and branches often hit the power lines. This makes the wires look bad. There are many tall trees all around. But many people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built on the hill, with big windows on the top to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water and sky are colorful. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can find. I once left my car outside for a month and when I went to use it, it was covered with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school a few blocks away, but most people are old and retired. Many people have dogs. They are often seen running in the street or in people's yards. If you leave a door or window open, they may go inside. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. Rabbits are also in our area. They are big and the gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants and burrows in people's lawns. My cats like them, and they have caught most of them. We also see small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle. But the neighborhood crows chase it away. There are no stores near me, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, and you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",

People do not move in and out of the neighborhood very much. So, I know most of the people who live here. They work in their yards and do daily tasks.\n\nIn the winter, we sled down a hill on our street. Our house is at the front of our street. We see people coming and going all day. When we see a new car, we take notice. Some of our neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. So, we are used to people seeing us come and go.\n\nWe go outside to play, even when it is raining. We sometimes grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We can hear lawn mowers every day from March to October. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a wooded area. There is a lot of shade, but also many leaves in the fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. The smell of burning leaves is nice.\n\nWe have not had much winter lately. It feels like a long fall. Our house has a garage at the back. We rarely use the front door. I like to work in the garage on my truck. When I open the garage doors, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is quiet. But when people from out of town visit, there are many cars. I like living here.

            "I live in a neighborhood in the middle of the desert. The area is very dry and brown. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like to see only brown all the time. When I first moved here in the 1990s, the houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses, but it still looks like a small town. Many places are changing like this. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly. However, like any town, it has both good and bad parts. I am lucky to live in a nice area with friendly older people.\n\nThere are not many different stores here. We have big chain stores like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go to another town. The main jobs in my area are in construction. This is because the town is not very developed and there is a lot of empty land. This makes me a little worried. I moved from a big city, and I don't want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars.\n\nI like living here because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert climate and land make it hard for animals to survive. We should learn about the animals that live here to live in harmony with them. My family and I have adapted to the wildlife. My children love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them.\n\nThere are some fun things to do here. Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair to have a fun and interesting experience. If you visit in the winter, you can go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take skiing lessons. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, including rocks, artifacts, and objects that tell the story of the town's history and development.",

It has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses in my neighborhood. They are apartments, houses, and dormitory houses. The apartments have 2-4 people living in each room. There are about 20 people in each building. Some houses are rented by people who are connected to the school. These houses usually have 2-4 bedrooms. But there are not many of these houses. Most students live in dormitory houses. These houses have 2 people sharing a room. This is the most common kind of house in my neighborhood.\n\nMy school is proud of its diversity. This means that people from many cultures and ages live in my neighborhood. Some professors and older students live in houses. New students live in dormitory houses, and older students live in apartments. There are many stores in my neighborhood.

It was a better place with a good school.\n\nAt first, I did not like it here. I missed my old home and friends. But I made new friends at school. I also met some people in the neighborhood who were nice. Mr. Glen and his children lived next door to us. They were kind to me and my family. I consider them like family. We had fun together. We went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was a happy day. I caught his wife's wedding strap, but I missed the flowers!\n\nThis neighborhood is like a big maze. But I have a GPS now, so I can explore it better. I like to walk around and visit my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games together and have fun. Sometimes I go to the park and enjoy nature. It helps me feel calm and peaceful.\n\nThe park has a basketball court and a tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and his friend Mr. Graves. They taught me how to play. We worked hard, but we had fun. Now I don't play as much, but it's nice to have the courts there.\n\nI have many happy memories of this neighborhood. I hope the best is yet to come.",
            "I live close to the college I attend. I like it because it's near the campus. There are many apartment buildings, some good restaurants, and fun bars. One of the bars changed its name and now costs more to visit. But the quality of service and drinks is not bad. Most people who live there are college students or have low incomes because the rent is not very high. There are many children in the area because a school is near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana, so the building manager put an air freshener near their door. This made my boyfriend and me laugh. It seems a little insulting. The buildings around me are old but might be nice inside. On the street, there are new apartments that are not well built. They are expensive, but the rent is high because they are near the campus. I do not like these apartments. A restaurant near me serves cheap food on paper plates. Most of their food is cooked in a microwave. There is a gas station near this restaurant that is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road near my apartment last year. Now the sidewalk is big, and there is grass on the sides of the road. This makes the area a little nicer. My apartment building has many trees. Some of them were cut down, but there are still many trees around me. Behind my building, there is a tree line and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street, but 43rd street is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street to hide the old buildings. The apartments on this street have a lot of problems. There is a lot of crime there. But I think I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are many good things near me, like the university and two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is very special. It has two houses connected together in a circle. They look like separate houses. The only difference is that each house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most of the people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk. The small children in the neighborhood play outside with toys, chalk or kites. This is nice in a world with many computers and machines. It feels like a different time. The neighborhood is near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and soft. However, this season we have had warnings about big storms and last night we heard a siren. We had to go to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and was nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail. After the storm, the road was hot and wet. The hail melted when it hit the ground. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I quickly took some pictures with my camera. The streets were quiet for a while after the storm. Then people started to come home from wherever they were. We went back to our normal routine. I love my neighborhood. I recently moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people in the South talk. I have a two-bedroom apartment. Everyone else in the neighborhood has the same kind. But the apartments are not all the same inside. Some are very small. I like to walk near a big field behind my house. I go to a small pond that is not a swimming pool. I have seen deer and in the morning I can hear a big frog singing. It is a great place to live near Charlotte. Every morning I hear roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. At first, it was hard for me to make friends. But I became close to two guys, one who lives two houses down from me and another who lives on my street. They are not living there anymore, but I still have good memories. Most of the people who were here when I moved here are still living here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburban neighborhoods. Our houses are mostly two-story. I hear kids playing outside on weekends when it is warm. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I have never had problems with my neighbors. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered packages online many times and never had them stolen from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends. I got hurt playing football, but I have many good memories there. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me think of happy times. Our neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. I can walk to Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food shops are popular, like in many neighborhoods. There are many good pizza places. We have many stores with everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There is even an Indian store where you can buy food to make at home or buy ready-made food. I like my neighborhood. I am grateful for my neighbors because I see many bad stories about neighborhoods on social media and the news.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special, but it is important for the agriculture industry. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign in the town. The town is mostly farms with peach trees or cows. Houses are far apart. They are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles. Most houses are not near the road. Instead, they are behind the fields where animals and crops grow. In the town center, there is one traffic light at a four-way stop. This is where you can find stores. There are three places to eat fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. People often go to a bigger store called Walmart in a nearby town to buy most of their food. The most popular store is Dollar General. It is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in Johnston for a long time. There is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels near the furniture store. They take care of pets. There are two small medical practices in the town. There is one elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Students go to school in the next town after fifth grade. There is a new park being built. It will be 2.5 acres. People will be able to play and visit. The town is small. There is not much to do. But it is a nice place to live.",
            "I learned about my area for the first time on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. Many apartments in the area cost more than one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story, and none of my friends knew about it either. Maybe it's because we have a hard time. I know some of my friends cry at night because life is expensive. But we have learned to be careful with money. We like old things, like toys from flea markets and old clothes. As we get older, we notice less. We may start smoking or get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on an old piano is a sign of adulthood. It smells bad, but it stays even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a store with unusual things. The streets can be crowded in the morning, but the stores are quiet. It's a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come here. It's a growing city, they say. One of the biggest online companies is here, and it's still trying to work out problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals, and nobody asks much from you. You can be alone if you want, and people will leave you alone. It's different from the South, where people care about each other. Here, you don't ask questions about people's lives. You can keep to yourself if you want. The city is a lively place. There is always something going on, like the pianist next door or the people singing upstairs. We are not just strangers in an apartment. We are friends who help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals, and we help each other when we can. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to be kind and helpful, and they do the same. We bring each other mail and help each other out. It's nice to see them, and I think they like my company too. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I'm not making a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is like many others. There are many houses that look the same. The homeowner's association is very strong here. This is why the houses are all in good condition. The yards are small and look the same. There is grass, pebbles and short driveways. Some houses have small trees. Everyone has a garage for two cars. The roads are good. They are paved and smooth. You will not find potholes here. Most of the houses are one story, but some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are big mailboxes at the end of the street. We use keys to get our mail. We also have two big boxes for packages.\n\nI live on the edge of a big city. My neighborhood is a mix of country and suburb. We have a lot of space. We have many community pools that are well maintained and locked. We also have walking paths where people walk their dogs or take a walk. You can get exercise without going to a park.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are old. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people. The city is big, but it has a small town feel. We have many things that people need. We have a big store with many things to buy. It takes 15 minutes to drive there. When we arrive, we have many choices. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell cheap things. All in all, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things. We are not close to big stores, but we can drive there easily.",
            "I live in a town in the middle of the United States. My home is near a big city, but not in the city itself. The area I live in is not rich. Most houses here are rented or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. There have been some violent crimes in the last ten years. Someone got killed in a fight near my house last year. But my family has been lucky. We have not been hurt by crime. Sometimes, we forget to bring things inside, and they get stolen. Our town has a big problem. Many people have died from taking too much of a strong drug called fentanyl. But we have help to stop this problem. There are places where people can get better and learn to live without the drug. Our school is very good. The teachers and staff are nice. My son goes to this school. He has problems, but he has not been bullied. The school makes sure all children have food to eat. They do not care if people do not have money. This is a good thing. The town is trying to make things better. They have fixed some roads and parks. But they have done more in the part of town where people go shopping. We wish they would do more for our part of town. Overall, I like living here. People are friendly, the school is good, and we have stores to buy what we need. Our house is not very valuable, but it is okay. We have lived here for a long time, and we like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. It is on a hill and has many old buildings. I live in a seven-story building near a famous theater. There is also a fun bar nearby that people like to go to on warm summer nights. Many people wait in line to get in, especially on weekends in June and July.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is located in the city and has a special wall around it with stairs. During the cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents near the park. They stay warm together and are close to a place where they can wash clothes and take a shower.\n\nBut what I like most about my neighborhood is the people. The area used to be known for violence, but the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city and their block. Some people say it is not safe for white people to walk around at night, but I think this is old news. I am not white, and the people in my neighborhood are kind to me. They quickly give me a jacket if I need one. The laundromat is also open late so I can charge my phone. Even on rainy days, people will give me money and tell me I am beautiful.\n\nI like walking around my neighborhood at night. The people here are kind and friendly. I feel at home here. I know that no matter where I go, my neighborhood will always be home.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. The area is mostly farmland and small tourist cities. There are no big city malls or big stores like Wal-mart or Target. If you need something, you have to drive to get it. But I live in a beautiful place. I am near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. My town is surrounded by water. I can walk to a beach and put my feet in the water.\n\nMy neighborhood is small and quiet. The houses are not stacked on top of each other. They are old and different from each other. Some houses have basements that you can see from the road. The houses are painted many different colors. Most have yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people grow food in their yards and have fences for their animals. My neighborhood looks like a typical American town. People work hard to make a living and raise their families.\n\nOn any day, you can see kids playing outside. People walk their dogs, ride bikes, and skate. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs in the neighborhood. You can see people grilling outside and say hello. The yards are well taken care of. The grass is mowed and trimmed. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nMy neighborhood is not very pretty, but it is a safe place to live. It has what people want: a safe place to be at the end of the day. Near my house, there is a police station and a jail. The health department and recycling center are also close. We have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers. There is a small airport next to the fields. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. I can walk to get ice cream from the local shop. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Portland, Oregon is a city with a special feeling. The city says its unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some people think this is a reminder of the past, when Portland was less known and less expensive. In those times, the city was home to many new and creative ideas. Others see it as a welcome to people who are different. They can be weird and be praised for it. Even though many new and rich people have moved to Portland, it is still a weird place. \"Weird\" does not mean everyone is free to do whatever they want. But it means people are accepting of things that others might not accept. Portland has modern things like other cities. People buy things made in China. There are many normal things in Portland, like yoga and hipsters and business people. Perhaps the weird thing about Portland is that people do not take these things too seriously. My neighborhood has colorful houses and flower gardens. There are free boxes along the street in the summer. Free boxes are boxes with things people are getting rid of. They can have clothes, books or anything. The fun of finding something new and interesting in a free box is part of what makes Portland special. But Portland is not perfect. It has problems like many other cities. There are people who do not like to accept things that are different. They like to do new and fun things like goat yoga or watch the local soccer team. Portland is full of people with different interests and passions. Some people are trying to make their dreams come true, while others are just enjoying the city.

That's why many houses are built on the hill, with big windows on the top to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water and sky are colorful. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can find. I once left my car outside for a month and when I went to use it, it was covered with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school a few blocks away, but most people are old and retired. Many people have dogs. They are often seen running in the street or in people's yards. If you leave a door or window open, they may go inside. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. Rabbits are also in our area. They are big and the gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants and burrows in people's lawns. My cats like them, and they have caught most of them. We also see small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle. But the neighborhood crows chase it away. There are no stores near me, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, and you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a quiet neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. It is between two state highways. We get some traffic on our street. But most of the time, it is quiet. People do not move in and out of the neighborhood very much. So, I know most of the people who live here. They work in their yards and do daily tasks.\n\nIn the winter, we sled down a hill on our street. Our house is at the front of our street. We see people coming and going all day. When we see a new car, we take notice. Some of our neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. So, we are used to people seeing us come and go.\n\nWe go outside to play, even when it is raining. We sometimes grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We can hear lawn mowers every day from March to October. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a wooded area. There is a lot of shade, but also many leaves in the fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. The smell of burning leaves is nice.\n\nWe have not had much winter lately. It feels like a long fall. Our house has a garage at the back. We rarely use the front door. I like to work in the garage on my truck. When I open the garage doors, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is quiet. But when people from out of town visit, there are many cars. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the middle of the desert. The area is very dry and brown. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like to see only brown all the time. When I first moved here in the 1990s, the houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses, but it still looks like a small town. Many places are changing like this. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly. However, like any town, it has both good and bad parts. I am lucky to live in a nice area with friendly older people.\n\nThere are not many different stores here. We have big chain stores like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go to another town. The main jobs in my area are in construction. This is because the town is not very developed and there is a lot of empty land. This makes me a little worried. I moved from a big city, and I don't want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars.\n\nI like living here because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert climate and land make it hard for animals to survive. We should learn about the animals that live here to live in harmony with them. My family and I have adapted to the wildlife. My children love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them.\n\nThere are some fun things to do here. Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair to have a fun and interesting experience. If you visit in the winter, you can go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take skiing lessons. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, including rocks, artifacts, and objects that tell the story of the town's history and development.",
            "I live in a neighborhood on a college campus. My community is the people who live in my dormitory. I also consider the campus as my neighborhood. This might be different from what others think of when they hear the word \"neighborhood.\" However, my neighborhood has some things that are the same as other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses in my neighborhood. They are apartments, houses, and dormitory houses. The apartments have 2-4 people living in each room. There are about 20 people in each building. Some houses are rented by people who are connected to the school. These houses usually have 2-4 bedrooms. But there are not many of these houses. Most students live in dormitory houses. These houses have 2 people sharing a room. This is the most common kind of house in my neighborhood.\n\nMy school is proud of its diversity. This means that people from many cultures and ages live in my neighborhood. Some professors and older students live in houses. New students live in dormitory houses, and older students live in apartments. There are many stores in my neighborhood. They sell food and school clothes. You can buy what you need in my neighborhood. There is one park where everyone can play. The park is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my mom and little sister. We left behind our old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best life for us. They moved us to a new house in this neighborhood. It was a better place with a good school.\n\nAt first, I did not like it here. I missed my old home and friends. But I made new friends at school. I also met some people in the neighborhood who were nice. Mr. Glen and his children lived next door to us. They were kind to me and my family. I consider them like family. We had fun together. We went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was a happy day. I caught his wife's wedding strap, but I missed the flowers!\n\nThis neighborhood is like a big maze. But I have a GPS now, so I can explore it better. I like to walk around and visit my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games together and have fun. Sometimes I go to the park and enjoy nature. It helps me feel calm and peaceful.\n\nThe park has a basketball court and a tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and his friend Mr. Graves. They taught me how to play. We worked hard, but we had fun. Now I don't play as much, but it's nice to have the courts there.\n\nI have many happy memories of this neighborhood. I hope the best is yet to come.",
            "I live close to the college I attend. I like it because it's near the campus. There are many apartment buildings, some good restaurants, and fun bars. One of the bars changed its name and now costs more to visit. But the quality of service and drinks is not bad. Most people who live there are college students or have low incomes because the rent is not very high. There are many children in the area because a school is near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana, so the building manager put an air freshener near their door. This made my boyfriend and me laugh. It seems a little insulting. The buildings around me are old but might be nice inside. On the street, there are new apartments that are not well built. They are expensive, but the rent is high because they are near the campus. I do not like these apartments. A restaurant near me serves cheap food on paper plates. Most of their food is cooked in a microwave. There is a gas station near this restaurant that is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road near my apartment last year. Now the sidewalk is big, and there is grass on the sides of the road. This makes the area a little nicer. My apartment building has many trees. Some of them were cut down, but there are still many trees around me. Behind my building, there is a tree line and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street, but 43rd street is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street to hide the old buildings. The apartments on this street have a lot of problems. There is a lot of crime there. But I think I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are many good things near me, like the university and two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is very special. It has two houses connected together in a circle. They look like separate houses. The only difference is that each house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most of the people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk. The small children in the neighborhood play outside with toys, chalk or kites. This is nice in a world with many computers and machines. It feels like a different time. The neighborhood is near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and soft. However, this season we have had warnings about big storms and last night we heard a siren. We had to go to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and was nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail. After the storm, the road was hot and wet. The hail melted when it hit the ground. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I quickly took some pictures with my camera. The streets were quiet for a while after the storm. Then people started to come home from wherever they were. We went back to our normal routine. I love my neighborhood. I recently moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people in the South talk. I have a two-bedroom apartment. Everyone else in the neighborhood has the same kind. But the apartments are not all the same inside. Some are very small. I like to walk near a big field behind my house. I go to a small pond that is not a swimming pool. I have seen deer and in the morning I can hear a big frog singing. It is a great place to live near Charlotte. Every morning I hear roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. At first, it was hard for me to make friends. But I became close to two guys, one who lives two houses down from me and another who lives on my street. They are not living there anymore, but I still have good memories. Most of the people who were here when I moved here are still living here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburban neighborhoods. Our houses are mostly two-story. I hear kids playing outside on weekends when it is warm. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I have never had problems with my neighbors. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered packages online many times and never had them stolen from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends. I got hurt playing football, but I have many good memories there. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me think of happy times. Our neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. I can walk to Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food shops are popular, like in many neighborhoods. There are many good pizza places. We have many stores with everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There is even an Indian store where you can buy food to make at home or buy ready-made food. I like my neighborhood. I am grateful for my neighbors because I see many bad stories about neighborhoods on social media and the news.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special, but it is important for the agriculture industry. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign in the town. The town is mostly farms with peach trees or cows. Houses are far apart. They are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles. Most houses are not near the road. Instead, they are behind the fields where animals and crops grow. In the town center, there is one traffic light at a four-way stop. This is where you can find stores. There are three places to eat fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. People often go to a bigger store called Walmart in a nearby town to buy most of their food. The most popular store is Dollar General. It is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in Johnston for a long time. There is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels near the furniture store. They take care of pets. There are two small medical practices in the town. There is one elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Students go to school in the next town after fifth grade. There is a new park being built. It will be 2.5 acres. People will be able to play and visit. The town is small. There is not much to do. But it is a nice place to live.",
            "I learned about my area for the first time on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. Many apartments in the area cost more than one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story, and none of my friends knew about it either. Maybe it's because we have a hard time. I know some of my friends cry at night because life is expensive. But we have learned to be careful with money. We like old things, like toys from flea markets and old clothes. As we get older, we notice less. We may start smoking or get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on an old piano is a sign of adulthood. It smells bad, but it stays even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a store with unusual things. The streets can be crowded in the morning, but the stores are quiet. It's a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come here. It's a growing city, they say. One of the biggest online companies is here, and it's still trying to work out problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals, and nobody asks much from you. You can be alone if you want, and people will leave you alone. It's different from the South, where people care about each other. Here, you don't ask questions about people's lives. You can keep to yourself if you want. The city is a lively place. There is always something going on, like the pianist next door or the people singing upstairs. We are not just strangers in an apartment. We are friends who help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals, and we help each other when we can. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to be kind and helpful, and they do the same. We bring each other mail and help each other out. It's nice to see them, and I think they like my company too. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I'm not making a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is like many others. There are many houses that look the same. The homeowner's association is very strong here. This is why the houses are all in good condition. The yards are small and look the same. There is grass, pebbles and short driveways. Some houses have small trees. Everyone has a garage for two cars. The roads are good. They are paved and smooth. You will not find potholes here. Most of the houses are one story, but some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are big mailboxes at the end of the street. We use keys to get our mail. We also have two big boxes for packages.\n\nI live on the edge of a big city. My neighborhood is a mix of country and suburb. We have a lot of space. We have many community pools that are well maintained and locked. We also have walking paths where people walk their dogs or take a walk. You can get exercise without going to a park.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are old. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people. The city is big, but it has a small town feel. We have many things that people need. We have a big store with many things to buy. It takes 15 minutes to drive there. When we arrive, we have many choices. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell cheap things. All in all, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things. We are not close to big stores, but we can drive there easily.",
            "I live in a town in the middle of the United States. My home is near a big city, but not in the city itself. The area I live in is not rich. Most houses here are rented or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. There have been some violent crimes in the last ten years. Someone got killed in a fight near my house last year. But my family has been lucky. We have not been hurt by crime. Sometimes, we forget to bring things inside, and they get stolen. Our town has a big problem. Many people have died from taking too much of a strong drug called fentanyl. But we have help to stop this problem. There are places where people can get better and learn to live without the drug. Our school is very good. The teachers and staff are nice. My son goes to this school. He has problems, but he has not been bullied. The school makes sure all children have food to eat. They do not care if people do not have money. This is a good thing. The town is trying to make things better. They have fixed some roads and parks. But they have done more in the part of town where people go shopping. We wish they would do more for our part of town. Overall, I like living here. People are friendly, the school is good, and we have stores to buy what we need. Our house is not very valuable, but it is okay. We have lived here for a long time, and we like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. It is on a hill and has many old buildings. I live in a seven-story building near a famous theater. There is also a fun bar nearby that people like to go to on warm summer nights. Many people wait in line to get in, especially on weekends in June and July.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is located in the city and has a special wall around it with stairs. During the cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents near the park. They stay warm together and are close to a place where they can wash clothes and take a shower.\n\nBut what I like most about my neighborhood is the people. The area used to be known for violence, but the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city and their block. Some people say it is not safe for white people to walk around at night, but I think this is old news. I am not white, and the people in my neighborhood are kind to me. They quickly give me a jacket if I need one. The laundromat is also open late so I can charge my phone. Even on rainy days, people will give me money and tell me I am beautiful.\n\nI like walking around my neighborhood at night. The people here are kind and friendly. I feel at home here. I know that no matter where I go, my neighborhood will always be home.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. The area is mostly farmland and small tourist cities. There are no big city malls or big stores like Wal-mart or Target. If you need something, you have to drive to get it. But I live in a beautiful place. I am near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. My town is surrounded by water. I can walk to a beach and put my feet in the water.\n\nMy neighborhood is small and quiet. The houses are not stacked on top of each other. They are old and different from each other. Some houses have basements that you can see from the road. The houses are painted many different colors. Most have yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people grow food in their yards and have fences for their animals. My neighborhood looks like a typical American town. People work hard to make a living and raise their families.\n\nOn any day, you can see kids playing outside. People walk their dogs, ride bikes, and skate. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs in the neighborhood. You can see people grilling outside and say hello. The yards are well taken care of. The grass is mowed and trimmed. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nMy neighborhood is not very pretty, but it is a safe place to live. It has what people want: a safe place to be at the end of the day. Near my house, there is a police station and a jail. The health department and recycling center are also close. We have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers. There is a small airport next to the fields. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. I can walk to get ice cream from the local shop. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

But if you walk behind the old, empty store and look behind the hotels, you'll find a busy community. There are small apartment buildings next to each other, like blocks in a row.

They are not well known to people who live in this area.\n\nNext to these buildings is a college. It's a small campus where students go to learn.

            "Portland, Oregon is a city with a special feeling. The city says its unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some people think this is a reminder of the past, when Portland was less known and less expensive. In those times, the city was home to many new and creative ideas. Others see it as a welcome to people who are different. They can be weird and be praised for it. Even though many new and rich people have moved to Portland, it is still a weird place. \"Weird\" does not mean everyone is free to do whatever they want. But it means people are accepting of things that others might not accept. Portland has modern things like other cities. People buy things made in China. There are many normal things in Portland, like yoga and hipsters and business people. Perhaps the weird thing about Portland is that people do not take these things too seriously. My neighborhood has colorful houses and flower gardens. There are free boxes along the street in the summer. Free boxes are boxes with things people are getting rid of. They can have clothes, books or anything. The fun of finding something new and interesting in a free box is part of what makes Portland special. But Portland is not perfect. It has problems like many other cities. There are people who do not like to accept things that are different. They like to do new and fun things like goat yoga or watch the local soccer team. Portland is full of people with different interests and passions. Some people are trying to make their dreams come true, while others are just enjoying the city. Portland also has problems with drugs and homelessness. These problems are not easy to solve. The city has good services for people in need, but they are not enough.

I looked up at the sun and saw the mountains. They were big and strong. They made me think about being strong and moving forward. They told me to keep going.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a hard time finding it. Public transportation is easy to use. Many people use it. Bensonhurt is a busy area. It feels like New York City. You will see many Asian stores. In the last twenty years, many Asian people moved to Bensonhurt. Now, you see an Asian store on almost every street. They sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, it costs less money, and it is easy to get.\n\nThere are many Asian supermarkets close to me. I can walk to four of them in two minutes. This is good because it is easy to buy food. Not all people in Bensonhurt are Asian. It is a diverse area. Many immigrants and their families live here. Most big businesses are owned by Asian people. There is a big park near here. It has many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, and a place for kids to play. You will see many different people in the park. They play and get along well.\n\nThere are not many big buildings in Bensonhurt. Most people live in co-ops, condos, or two-family houses. Most people are nice, but it can be noisy. You will hear cars playing music, and people driving fast in the morning. If you visit at night, you should be careful. Bensonhurt is safe, but some people can be mean. I was hurt by someone a long time ago. Recently, some people stole packages. This happens in many places. Also, people do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the ground every morning. My main problem is dog waste on the floor. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place without sidewalks. My house is on the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"exercise hill\" because many joggers like to run up it every day. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is not good and can be hard to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires are old and look bad. The area gets a lot of rain and wind, and branches often hit the power lines. This makes the wires look bad. There are many tall trees all around. But many people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built on the hill, with big windows on the top to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water and sky are colorful. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can find. I once left my car outside for a month and when I went to use it, it was covered with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school a few blocks away, but most people are old and retired. Many people have dogs. They are often seen running in the street or in people's yards. If you leave a door or window open, they may go inside. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. Rabbits are also in our area. They are big and the gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants and burrows in people's lawns. My cats like them, and they have caught most of them. We also see small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle. But the neighborhood crows chase it away. There are no stores near me, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, and you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a quiet neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. It is between two state highways. We get some traffic on our street. But most of the time, it is quiet. People do not move in and out of the neighborhood very much. So, I know most of the people who live here. They work in their yards and do daily tasks.\n\nIn the winter, we sled down a hill on our street. Our house is at the front of our street. We see people coming and going all day. When we see a new car, we take notice. Some of our neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. So, we are used to people seeing us come and go.\n\nWe go outside to play, even when it is raining. We sometimes grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We can hear lawn mowers every day from March to October. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a wooded area. There is a lot of shade, but also many leaves in the fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. The smell of burning leaves is nice.\n\nWe have not had much winter lately. It feels like a long fall. Our house has a garage at the back. We rarely use the front door. I like to work in the garage on my truck. When I open the garage doors, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is quiet. But when people from out of town visit, there are many cars. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the middle of the desert. The area is very dry and brown. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like to see only brown all the time. When I first moved here in the 1990s, the houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses, but it still looks like a small town. Many places are changing like this. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly. However, like any town, it has both good and bad parts. I am lucky to live in a nice area with friendly older people.\n\nThere are not many different stores here. We have big chain stores like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go to another town. The main jobs in my area are in construction. This is because the town is not very developed and there is a lot of empty land. This makes me a little worried. I moved from a big city, and I don't want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars.\n\nI like living here because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert climate and land make it hard for animals to survive. We should learn about the animals that live here to live in harmony with them. My family and I have adapted to the wildlife. My children love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them.\n\nThere are some fun things to do here. Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair to have a fun and interesting experience. If you visit in the winter, you can go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take skiing lessons. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, including rocks, artifacts, and objects that tell the story of the town's history and development.",
            "I live in a neighborhood on a college campus. My community is the people who live in my dormitory. I also consider the campus as my neighborhood. This might be different from what others think of when they hear the word \"neighborhood.\" However, my neighborhood has some things that are the same as other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses in my neighborhood. They are apartments, houses, and dormitory houses. The apartments have 2-4 people living in each room. There are about 20 people in each building. Some houses are rented by people who are connected to the school. These houses usually have 2-4 bedrooms. But there are not many of these houses. Most students live in dormitory houses. These houses have 2 people sharing a room. This is the most common kind of house in my neighborhood.\n\nMy school is proud of its diversity. This means that people from many cultures and ages live in my neighborhood. Some professors and older students live in houses. New students live in dormitory houses, and older students live in apartments. There are many stores in my neighborhood. They sell food and school clothes. You can buy what you need in my neighborhood. There is one park where everyone can play. The park is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my mom and little sister. We left behind our old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best life for us. They moved us to a new house in this neighborhood. It was a better place with a good school.\n\nAt first, I did not like it here. I missed my old home and friends. But I made new friends at school. I also met some people in the neighborhood who were nice. Mr. Glen and his children lived next door to us. They were kind to me and my family. I consider them like family. We had fun together. We went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was a happy day. I caught his wife's wedding strap, but I missed the flowers!\n\nThis neighborhood is like a big maze. But I have a GPS now, so I can explore it better. I like to walk around and visit my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games together and have fun. Sometimes I go to the park and enjoy nature. It helps me feel calm and peaceful.\n\nThe park has a basketball court and a tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and his friend Mr. Graves. They taught me how to play. We worked hard, but we had fun. Now I don't play as much, but it's nice to have the courts there.\n\nI have many happy memories of this neighborhood. I hope the best is yet to come.",
            "I live close to the college I attend. I like it because it's near the campus. There are many apartment buildings, some good restaurants, and fun bars. One of the bars changed its name and now costs more to visit. But the quality of service and drinks is not bad. Most people who live there are college students or have low incomes because the rent is not very high. There are many children in the area because a school is near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana, so the building manager put an air freshener near their door. This made my boyfriend and me laugh. It seems a little insulting. The buildings around me are old but might be nice inside. On the street, there are new apartments that are not well built. They are expensive, but the rent is high because they are near the campus. I do not like these apartments. A restaurant near me serves cheap food on paper plates. Most of their food is cooked in a microwave. There is a gas station near this restaurant that is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road near my apartment last year. Now the sidewalk is big, and there is grass on the sides of the road. This makes the area a little nicer. My apartment building has many trees. Some of them were cut down, but there are still many trees around me. Behind my building, there is a tree line and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street, but 43rd street is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street to hide the old buildings. The apartments on this street have a lot of problems. There is a lot of crime there. But I think I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are many good things near me, like the university and two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is very special. It has two houses connected together in a circle. They look like separate houses. The only difference is that each house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most of the people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk. The small children in the neighborhood play outside with toys, chalk or kites. This is nice in a world with many computers and machines. It feels like a different time. The neighborhood is near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and soft. However, this season we have had warnings about big storms and last night we heard a siren. We had to go to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and was nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail. After the storm, the road was hot and wet. The hail melted when it hit the ground. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I quickly took some pictures with my camera. The streets were quiet for a while after the storm. Then people started to come home from wherever they were. We went back to our normal routine. I love my neighborhood. I recently moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people in the South talk. I have a two-bedroom apartment. Everyone else in the neighborhood has the same kind. But the apartments are not all the same inside. Some are very small. I like to walk near a big field behind my house. I go to a small pond that is not a swimming pool. I have seen deer and in the morning I can hear a big frog singing. It is a great place to live near Charlotte. Every morning I hear roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. At first, it was hard for me to make friends. But I became close to two guys, one who lives two houses down from me and another who lives on my street. They are not living there anymore, but I still have good memories. Most of the people who were here when I moved here are still living here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburban neighborhoods. Our houses are mostly two-story. I hear kids playing outside on weekends when it is warm. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I have never had problems with my neighbors. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered packages online many times and never had them stolen from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends. I got hurt playing football, but I have many good memories there. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me think of happy times. Our neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. I can walk to Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food shops are popular, like in many neighborhoods. There are many good pizza places. We have many stores with everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There is even an Indian store where you can buy food to make at home or buy ready-made food. I like my neighborhood. I am grateful for my neighbors because I see many bad stories about neighborhoods on social media and the news.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special, but it is important for the agriculture industry. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign in the town. The town is mostly farms with peach trees or cows. Houses are far apart. They are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles. Most houses are not near the road. Instead, they are behind the fields where animals and crops grow. In the town center, there is one traffic light at a four-way stop. This is where you can find stores. There are three places to eat fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. People often go to a bigger store called Walmart in a nearby town to buy most of their food. The most popular store is Dollar General. It is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in Johnston for a long time. There is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels near the furniture store. They take care of pets. There are two small medical practices in the town. There is one elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Students go to school in the next town after fifth grade. There is a new park being built. It will be 2.5 acres. People will be able to play and visit. The town is small. There is not much to do. But it is a nice place to live.",
            "I learned about my area for the first time on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. Many apartments in the area cost more than one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story, and none of my friends knew about it either. Maybe it's because we have a hard time. I know some of my friends cry at night because life is expensive. But we have learned to be careful with money. We like old things, like toys from flea markets and old clothes. As we get older, we notice less. We may start smoking or get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on an old piano is a sign of adulthood. It smells bad, but it stays even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a store with unusual things. The streets can be crowded in the morning, but the stores are quiet. It's a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come here. It's a growing city, they say. One of the biggest online companies is here, and it's still trying to work out problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals, and nobody asks much from you. You can be alone if you want, and people will leave you alone. It's different from the South, where people care about each other. Here, you don't ask questions about people's lives. You can keep to yourself if you want. The city is a lively place. There is always something going on, like the pianist next door or the people singing upstairs. We are not just strangers in an apartment. We are friends who help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals, and we help each other when we can. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to be kind and helpful, and they do the same. We bring each other mail and help each other out. It's nice to see them, and I think they like my company too. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I'm not making a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is like many others. There are many houses that look the same. The homeowner's association is very strong here. This is why the houses are all in good condition. The yards are small and look the same. There is grass, pebbles and short driveways. Some houses have small trees. Everyone has a garage for two cars. The roads are good. They are paved and smooth. You will not find potholes here. Most of the houses are one story, but some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are big mailboxes at the end of the street. We use keys to get our mail. We also have two big boxes for packages.\n\nI live on the edge of a big city. My neighborhood is a mix of country and suburb. We have a lot of space. We have many community pools that are well maintained and locked. We also have walking paths where people walk their dogs or take a walk. You can get exercise without going to a park.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are old. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people. The city is big, but it has a small town feel. We have many things that people need. We have a big store with many things to buy. It takes 15 minutes to drive there. When we arrive, we have many choices. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell cheap things. All in all, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things. We are not close to big stores, but we can drive there easily.",
            "I live in a town in the middle of the United States. My home is near a big city, but not in the city itself. The area I live in is not rich. Most houses here are rented or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. There have been some violent crimes in the last ten years. Someone got killed in a fight near my house last year. But my family has been lucky. We have not been hurt by crime. Sometimes, we forget to bring things inside, and they get stolen. Our town has a big problem. Many people have died from taking too much of a strong drug called fentanyl. But we have help to stop this problem. There are places where people can get better and learn to live without the drug. Our school is very good. The teachers and staff are nice. My son goes to this school. He has problems, but he has not been bullied. The school makes sure all children have food to eat. They do not care if people do not have money. This is a good thing. The town is trying to make things better. They have fixed some roads and parks. But they have done more in the part of town where people go shopping. We wish they would do more for our part of town. Overall, I like living here. People are friendly, the school is good, and we have stores to buy what we need. Our house is not very valuable, but it is okay. We have lived here for a long time, and we like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. It is on a hill and has many old buildings. I live in a seven-story building near a famous theater. There is also a fun bar nearby that people like to go to on warm summer nights. Many people wait in line to get in, especially on weekends in June and July.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is located in the city and has a special wall around it with stairs. During the cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents near the park. They stay warm together and are close to a place where they can wash clothes and take a shower.\n\nBut what I like most about my neighborhood is the people. The area used to be known for violence, but the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city and their block. Some people say it is not safe for white people to walk around at night, but I think this is old news. I am not white, and the people in my neighborhood are kind to me. They quickly give me a jacket if I need one. The laundromat is also open late so I can charge my phone. Even on rainy days, people will give me money and tell me I am beautiful.\n\nI like walking around my neighborhood at night. The people here are kind and friendly. I feel at home here. I know that no matter where I go, my neighborhood will always be home.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. The area is mostly farmland and small tourist cities. There are no big city malls or big stores like Wal-mart or Target. If you need something, you have to drive to get it. But I live in a beautiful place. I am near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. My town is surrounded by water. I can walk to a beach and put my feet in the water.\n\nMy neighborhood is small and quiet. The houses are not stacked on top of each other. They are old and different from each other. Some houses have basements that you can see from the road. The houses are painted many different colors. Most have yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people grow food in their yards and have fences for their animals. My neighborhood looks like a typical American town. People work hard to make a living and raise their families.\n\nOn any day, you can see kids playing outside. People walk their dogs, ride bikes, and skate. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs in the neighborhood. You can see people grilling outside and say hello. The yards are well taken care of. The grass is mowed and trimmed. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nMy neighborhood is not very pretty, but it is a safe place to live. It has what people want: a safe place to be at the end of the day. Near my house, there is a police station and a jail. The health department and recycling center are also close. We have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers. There is a small airport next to the fields. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. I can walk to get ice cream from the local shop. It is a great place to live."
