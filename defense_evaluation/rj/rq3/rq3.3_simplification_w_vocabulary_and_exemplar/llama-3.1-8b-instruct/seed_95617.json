            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

But if you walk behind the old, empty store and look behind the hotels, you'll find a busy community. There are small apartment buildings next to each other, like blocks in a row.

They are not well known to people who live in this area.\n\nNext to these buildings is a college. It's a small campus where students go to learn.

            "Portland, Oregon is a city with a special feeling. The city says its unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some people think this is a reminder of the past, when Portland was less known and less expensive. In those times, the city was home to many new and creative ideas. Others see it as a welcome to people who are different. They can be weird and be praised for it. Even though many new and rich people have moved to Portland, it is still a weird place. \"Weird\" does not mean everyone is free to do whatever they want. But it means people are accepting of things that others might not accept. Portland has modern things like other cities. People buy things made in China. There are many normal things in Portland, like yoga and hipsters and business people. Perhaps the weird thing about Portland is that people do not take these things too seriously. My neighborhood has colorful houses and flower gardens. There are free boxes along the street in the summer. Free boxes are boxes with things people are getting rid of. They can have clothes, books or anything. The fun of finding something new and interesting in a free box is part of what makes Portland special. But Portland is not perfect. It has problems like many other cities. There are people who do not like to accept things that are different. They like to do new and fun things like goat yoga or watch the local soccer team. Portland is full of people with different interests and passions. Some people are trying to make their dreams come true, while others are just enjoying the city. Portland also has problems with drugs and homelessness. These problems are not easy to solve. The city has good services for people in need, but they are not enough.

It is quiet and peaceful, or it is busy and exciting. This makes it a fun place to live. I have many good memories here. I walk with friends in the park and visit the movie theater. But I also have sad memories. The ponds can be a good place to think or cry. I have spent many nights thinking about my life by the pond.\n\nOne time, I walked by the pond and the park. I looked up at the sun and saw the mountains. They were big and strong. They made me think about being strong and moving forward. They told me to keep going.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a hard time finding it. Public transportation is easy to use. Many people use it. Bensonhurt is a busy area. It feels like New York City. You will see many Asian stores. In the last twenty years, many Asian people moved to Bensonhurt. Now, you see an Asian store on almost every street. They sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, it costs less money, and it is easy to get.\n\nThere are many Asian supermarkets close to me. I can walk to four of them in two minutes. This is good because it is easy to buy food. Not all people in Bensonhurt are Asian. It is a diverse area. Many immigrants and their families live here. Most big businesses are owned by Asian people. There is a big park near here. It has many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, and a place for kids to play. You will see many different people in the park. They play and get along well.\n\nThere are not many big buildings in Bensonhurt. Most people live in co-ops, condos, or two-family houses. Most people are nice, but it can be noisy. You will hear cars playing music, and people driving fast in the morning. If you visit at night, you should be careful. Bensonhurt is safe, but some people can be mean. I was hurt by someone a long time ago. Recently, some people stole packages. This happens in many places. Also, people do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the ground every morning. My main problem is dog waste on the floor. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place without sidewalks. My house is on the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"exercise hill\" because many joggers like to run up it every day. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is not good and can be hard to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires are old and look bad. The area gets a lot of rain and wind, and branches often hit the power lines. This makes the wires look bad. There are many tall trees all around. But many people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built on the hill, with big windows on the top to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water and sky are colorful. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can find. I once left my car outside for a month and when I went to use it, it was covered with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school a few blocks away, but most people are old and retired. Many people have dogs. They are often seen running in the street or in people's yards. If you leave a door or window open, they may go inside. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. Rabbits are also in our area. They are big and the gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants and burrows in people's lawns. My cats like them, and they have caught most of them. We also see small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle. But the neighborhood crows chase it away. There are no stores near me, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, and you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a quiet neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. It is between two state highways. We get some traffic on our street. But most of the time, it is quiet. People do not move in and out of the neighborhood very much. So, I know most of the people who live here. They work in their yards and do daily tasks.\n\nIn the winter, we sled down a hill on our street. Our house is at the front of our street. We see people coming and going all day. When we see a new car, we take notice. Some of our neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. So, we are used to people seeing us come and go.\n\nWe go outside to play, even when it is raining. We sometimes grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We can hear lawn mowers every day from March to October. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a wooded area. There is a lot of shade, but also many leaves in the fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. The smell of burning leaves is nice.\n\nWe have not had much winter lately. It feels like a long fall. Our house has a garage at the back. We rarely use the front door. I like to work in the garage on my truck. When I open the garage doors, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is quiet. But when people from out of town visit, there are many cars. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the middle of the desert. The area is very dry and brown. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like to see only brown all the time. When I first moved here in the 1990s, the houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses, but it still looks like a small town. Many places are changing like this. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly. However, like any town, it has both good and bad parts. I am lucky to live in a nice area with friendly older people.\n\nThere are not many different stores here. We have big chain stores like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go to another town. The main jobs in my area are in construction. This is because the town is not very developed and there is a lot of empty land. This makes me a little worried. I moved from a big city, and I don't want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars.\n\nI like living here because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert climate and land make it hard for animals to survive. We should learn about the animals that live here to live in harmony with them. My family and I have adapted to the wildlife. My children love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them.\n\nThere are some fun things to do here. Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair to have a fun and interesting experience. If you visit in the winter, you can go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take skiing lessons. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, including rocks, artifacts, and objects that tell the story of the town's history and development.",
            "I live in a neighborhood on a college campus. My community is the people who live in my dormitory. I also consider the campus as my neighborhood. This might be different from what others think of when they hear the word \"neighborhood.\" However, my neighborhood has some things that are the same as other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses in my neighborhood. They are apartments, houses, and dormitory houses. The apartments have 2-4 people living in each room. There are about 20 people in each building. Some houses are rented by people who are connected to the school. These houses usually have 2-4 bedrooms. But there are not many of these houses. Most students live in dormitory houses. These houses have 2 people sharing a room. This is the most common kind of house in my neighborhood.\n\nMy school is proud of its diversity. This means that people from many cultures and ages live in my neighborhood. Some professors and older students live in houses. New students live in dormitory houses, and older students live in apartments. There are many stores in my neighborhood. They sell food and school clothes. You can buy what you need in my neighborhood. There is one park where everyone can play. The park is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my mom and little sister. We left behind our old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best life for us. They moved us to a new house in this neighborhood. It was a better place with a good school.\n\nAt first, I did not like it here. I missed my old home and friends. But I made new friends at school. I also met some people in the neighborhood who were nice. Mr. Glen and his children lived next door to us. They were kind to me and my family. I consider them like family. We had fun together. We went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was a happy day. I caught his wife's wedding strap, but I missed the flowers!\n\nThis neighborhood is like a big maze. But I have a GPS now, so I can explore it better. I like to walk around and visit my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games together and have fun. Sometimes I go to the park and enjoy nature. It helps me feel calm and peaceful.\n\nThe park has a basketball court and a tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and his friend Mr. Graves. They taught me how to play. We worked hard, but we had fun. Now I don't play as much, but it's nice to have the courts there.\n\nI have many happy memories of this neighborhood. I hope the best is yet to come.",
            "I live close to the college I attend. I like it because it's near the campus. There are many apartment buildings, some good restaurants, and fun bars. One of the bars changed its name and now costs more to visit. But the quality of service and drinks is not bad. Most people who live there are college students or have low incomes because the rent is not very high. There are many children in the area because a school is near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana, so the building manager put an air freshener near their door. This made my boyfriend and me laugh. It seems a little insulting. The buildings around me are old but might be nice inside. On the street, there are new apartments that are not well built. They are expensive, but the rent is high because they are near the campus. I do not like these apartments. A restaurant near me serves cheap food on paper plates. Most of their food is cooked in a microwave. There is a gas station near this restaurant that is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road near my apartment last year. Now the sidewalk is big, and there is grass on the sides of the road. This makes the area a little nicer. My apartment building has many trees. Some of them were cut down, but there are still many trees around me. Behind my building, there is a tree line and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street, but 43rd street is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street to hide the old buildings. The apartments on this street have a lot of problems. There is a lot of crime there. But I think I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are many good things near me, like the university and two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is very special. It has two houses connected together in a circle. They look like separate houses. The only difference is that each house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most of the people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk. The small children in the neighborhood play outside with toys, chalk or kites. This is nice in a world with many computers and machines. It feels like a different time. The neighborhood is near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and soft. However, this season we have had warnings about big storms and last night we heard a siren. We had to go to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and was nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail. After the storm, the road was hot and wet. The hail melted when it hit the ground. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I quickly took some pictures with my camera. The streets were quiet for a while after the storm. Then people started to come home from wherever they were. We went back to our normal routine. I love my neighborhood. I recently moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people in the South talk. I have a two-bedroom apartment. Everyone else in the neighborhood has the same kind. But the apartments are not all the same inside. Some are very small. I like to walk near a big field behind my house. I go to a small pond that is not a swimming pool. I have seen deer and in the morning I can hear a big frog singing. It is a great place to live near Charlotte. Every morning I hear roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. At first, it was hard for me to make friends. But I became close to two guys, one who lives two houses down from me and another who lives on my street. They are not living there anymore, but I still have good memories. Most of the people who were here when I moved here are still living here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburban neighborhoods. Our houses are mostly two-story. I hear kids playing outside on weekends when it is warm. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I have never had problems with my neighbors. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered packages online many times and never had them stolen from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends. I got hurt playing football, but I have many good memories there. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me think of happy times. Our neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. I can walk to Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food shops are popular, like in many neighborhoods. There are many good pizza places. We have many stores with everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There is even an Indian store where you can buy food to make at home or buy ready-made food. I like my neighborhood. I am grateful for my neighbors because I see many bad stories about neighborhoods on social media and the news.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special, but it is important for the agriculture industry. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign in the town. The town is mostly farms with peach trees or cows. Houses are far apart. They are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles. Most houses are not near the road. Instead, they are behind the fields where animals and crops grow. In the town center, there is one traffic light at a four-way stop. This is where you can find stores. There are three places to eat fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. People often go to a bigger store called Walmart in a nearby town to buy most of their food. The most popular store is Dollar General. It is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in Johnston for a long time. There is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels near the furniture store. They take care of pets. There are two small medical practices in the town. There is one elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Students go to school in the next town after fifth grade. There is a new park being built. It will be 2.5 acres. People will be able to play and visit. The town is small. There is not much to do. But it is a nice place to live.",
            "I learned about my area for the first time on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. Many apartments in the area cost more than one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story, and none of my friends knew about it either. Maybe it's because we have a hard time. I know some of my friends cry at night because life is expensive. But we have learned to be careful with money. We like old things, like toys from flea markets and old clothes. As we get older, we notice less. We may start smoking or get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on an old piano is a sign of adulthood. It smells bad, but it stays even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a store with unusual things. The streets can be crowded in the morning, but the stores are quiet. It's a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come here. It's a growing city, they say. One of the biggest online companies is here, and it's still trying to work out problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals, and nobody asks much from you. You can be alone if you want, and people will leave you alone. It's different from the South, where people care about each other. Here, you don't ask questions about people's lives. You can keep to yourself if you want. The city is a lively place. There is always something going on, like the pianist next door or the people singing upstairs. We are not just strangers in an apartment. We are friends who help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals, and we help each other when we can. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to be kind and helpful, and they do the same. We bring each other mail and help each other out. It's nice to see them, and I think they like my company too. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I'm not making a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is like many others. There are many houses that look the same. The homeowner's association is very strong here. This is why the houses are all in good condition. The yards are small and look the same. There is grass, pebbles and short driveways. Some houses have small trees. Everyone has a garage for two cars. The roads are good. They are paved and smooth. You will not find potholes here. Most of the houses are one story, but some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are big mailboxes at the end of the street. We use keys to get our mail. We also have two big boxes for packages.\n\nI live on the edge of a big city. My neighborhood is a mix of country and suburb. We have a lot of space. We have many community pools that are well maintained and locked. We also have walking paths where people walk their dogs or take a walk. You can get exercise without going to a park.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are old. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people. The city is big, but it has a small town feel. We have many things that people need. We have a big store with many things to buy. It takes 15 minutes to drive there. When we arrive, we have many choices. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell cheap things. All in all, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things. We are not close to big stores, but we can drive there easily.",
            "I live in a town in the middle of the United States. My home is near a big city, but not in the city itself. The area I live in is not rich. Most houses here are rented or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. There have been some violent crimes in the last ten years. Someone got killed in a fight near my house last year. But my family has been lucky. We have not been hurt by crime. Sometimes, we forget to bring things inside, and they get stolen. Our town has a big problem. Many people have died from taking too much of a strong drug called fentanyl. But we have help to stop this problem. There are places where people can get better and learn to live without the drug. Our school is very good. The teachers and staff are nice. My son goes to this school. He has problems, but he has not been bullied. The school makes sure all children have food to eat. They do not care if people do not have money. This is a good thing. The town is trying to make things better. They have fixed some roads and parks. But they have done more in the part of town where people go shopping. We wish they would do more for our part of town. Overall, I like living here. People are friendly, the school is good, and we have stores to buy what we need. Our house is not very valuable, but it is okay. We have lived here for a long time, and we like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. It is on a hill and has many old buildings. I live in a seven-story building near a famous theater. There is also a fun bar nearby that people like to go to on warm summer nights. Many people wait in line to get in, especially on weekends in June and July.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is located in the city and has a special wall around it with stairs. During the cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents near the park. They stay warm together and are close to a place where they can wash clothes and take a shower.\n\nBut what I like most about my neighborhood is the people. The area used to be known for violence, but the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city and their block. Some people say it is not safe for white people to walk around at night, but I think this is old news. I am not white, and the people in my neighborhood are kind to me. They quickly give me a jacket if I need one. The laundromat is also open late so I can charge my phone. Even on rainy days, people will give me money and tell me I am beautiful.\n\nI like walking around my neighborhood at night. The people here are kind and friendly. I feel at home here. I know that no matter where I go, my neighborhood will always be home.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. The area is mostly farmland and small tourist cities. There are no big city malls or big stores like Wal-mart or Target. If you need something, you have to drive to get it. But I live in a beautiful place. I am near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. My town is surrounded by water. I can walk to a beach and put my feet in the water.\n\nMy neighborhood is small and quiet. The houses are not stacked on top of each other. They are old and different from each other. Some houses have basements that you can see from the road. The houses are painted many different colors. Most have yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people grow food in their yards and have fences for their animals. My neighborhood looks like a typical American town. People work hard to make a living and raise their families.\n\nOn any day, you can see kids playing outside. People walk their dogs, ride bikes, and skate. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs in the neighborhood. You can see people grilling outside and say hello. The yards are well taken care of. The grass is mowed and trimmed. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nMy neighborhood is not very pretty, but it is a safe place to live. It has what people want: a safe place to be at the end of the day. Near my house, there is a police station and a jail. The health department and recycling center are also close. We have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers. There is a small airport next to the fields. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. I can walk to get ice cream from the local shop. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood is interesting. It has many single-family houses. Some houses are divided into two parts, but they are still connected. My house has a small front yard and a small driveway to the side. Most houses look like the past. Living in the suburbs was once a great dream in America. But now, that dream is not as strong. My neighborhood still shows us the dream is still alive. Many people still visit and live here. The people are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as much. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children still play outside. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still shows children the future. It makes older people remember the past. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are still full. All houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called Super A. It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are one of the few Arab families in the neighborhood. Many people here are African American. The streets are wide, and children play football. Most people have lived here for many years. They can tell stories about the past when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but it closed when people stopped wanting to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. People think medicine makes everything better. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not have new movies. Older people like it because it is a cheap way to go out. There is a big road that passes through our town. The entrance and exit are in the town next to ours. Some people wanted an exit for our town, but others did not. They thought it would ruin the town. The city council listened to the elders and said no. We are building a new high school. We are choosing a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good choice for us.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It looks just like a normal residential area behind a shopping strip. Not a place you would think people would want to live, right? But if you walk behind the old, empty store and look behind the hotels, you'll find a busy community. There are small apartment buildings next to each other, like blocks in a row. The first buildings you see have been in the news for some problems. Let's not talk too much about those. The other buildings are a different story. They are not well known to people who live in this area.\n\nNext to these buildings is a college. It's a small campus where students go to learn. They come in early in the morning, carrying coffee and yawning. A big gate opens slowly to let them in. People driving by on the road get angry when the gate blocks the way. The road meets another street with a park and a building where people go to get better after they hurt themselves. The building has nice chairs on the porch and a big fan that moves the hot air around. Children play in the park, running and spinning around. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Older people take their dogs for walks on the path. They look at the teenagers on skateboards and the girls talking by the playground. There is a store that sells sushi in a shopping center near the park. It's cheap but never too busy. There's a store that sells pool supplies next to it, and a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken. That's the beauty of a shopping center. There's also a place that sells frozen yogurt. You can see the teenagers in the park with cold yogurt and toppings, doing tricks on their skateboards. This is a typical American neighborhood. It's a part of history in a quiet part of town where not much changes, not even time.",
            "We drove past many corn fields. They went on and on as far as the eye could see. \"Where is everything?\" she asked. I knew she was surprised by the empty space. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her house. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. I showed her a big lake with water. Near it was my home in a small group of houses. They were made of brick and stucco. Each house had a lot of land. People took care of their land and planted flowers. In the spring, the trees changed with the seasons. The driveways were filled with expensive cars. They shone in the sun after a car wash.\n\nI drove my car along the road to my house. It is made of grey stucco. My Korean neighbor was outside. He was always friendly and mowed his lawn every day. He sang over the noise of his lawn mower. Everyone liked him, but he had gotten older and a little slower. He was a doctor many years ago. He liked to hide behind his lawn mower.\n\nWe kept driving. Geese lived in my side yard. They ran from my dog. There was a small stream in the back that flowed into the lake. You could hear the stream, the frogs, and the cows from the nearby farms. There was a small bridge made of wood over the stream. On the other side was a special place with trees, herbs, and flowers. I spent most of my childhood there. I built forts and chased animals when I was a kid. I had many friends in the neighborhood. The winters were cold, but they were also beautiful. The trees were bare, and it snowed sometimes. We made snowmen and snow angels. My sister and I fought a lot when we were young. We used snowballs as weapons. We built forts to keep our snowballs safe. We played in our own winter wonderland.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city with a special feeling. The city says its unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some people think this is a reminder of the past, when Portland was less known and less expensive. In those times, the city was home to many new and creative ideas. Others see it as a welcome to people who are different. They can be weird and be praised for it. Even though many new and rich people have moved to Portland, it is still a weird place. \"Weird\" does not mean everyone is free to do whatever they want. But it means people are accepting of things that others might not accept. Portland has modern things like other cities. People buy things made in China. There are many normal things in Portland, like yoga and hipsters and business people. Perhaps the weird thing about Portland is that people do not take these things too seriously. My neighborhood has colorful houses and flower gardens. There are free boxes along the street in the summer. Free boxes are boxes with things people are getting rid of. They can have clothes, books or anything. The fun of finding something new and interesting in a free box is part of what makes Portland special. But Portland is not perfect. It has problems like many other cities. There are people who do not like to accept things that are different. They like to do new and fun things like goat yoga or watch the local soccer team. Portland is full of people with different interests and passions. Some people are trying to make their dreams come true, while others are just enjoying the city. Portland also has problems with drugs and homelessness. These problems are not easy to solve. The city has good services for people in need, but they are not enough. Many people in the city do not know what to do about these problems.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are to the north. They see the sun each morning and each evening. They do not change. They do not care about our problems. They are strong and steady.\n\nWhen I am sad or stressed, I look at the mountains. They help me feel better. They give me strength to keep going. I moved to this place when I started college. The mountains near the school are what I first liked. The school has many beautiful buildings and ponds. But the mountains are special.\n\nThe town has many nice places. There are many cafés where people study and drink coffee. We can walk or take a bus to the town center. It is old and has a lot of history. The buildings are colorful and old. The town is not big. But it has a lot of energy like a big city. We can walk to the library to get away from the busy town.\n\nThis town is special. It has two different sides. It is quiet and peaceful, or it is busy and exciting. This makes it a fun place to live. I have many good memories here. I walk with friends in the park and visit the movie theater. But I also have sad memories. The ponds can be a good place to think or cry. I have spent many nights thinking about my life by the pond.\n\nOne time, I walked by the pond and the park. I looked up at the sun and saw the mountains. They were big and strong. They made me think about being strong and moving forward. They told me to keep going.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a hard time finding it. Public transportation is easy to use. Many people use it. Bensonhurt is a busy area. It feels like New York City. You will see many Asian stores. In the last twenty years, many Asian people moved to Bensonhurt. Now, you see an Asian store on almost every street. They sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, it costs less money, and it is easy to get.\n\nThere are many Asian supermarkets close to me. I can walk to four of them in two minutes. This is good because it is easy to buy food. Not all people in Bensonhurt are Asian. It is a diverse area. Many immigrants and their families live here. Most big businesses are owned by Asian people. There is a big park near here. It has many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, and a place for kids to play. You will see many different people in the park. They play and get along well.\n\nThere are not many big buildings in Bensonhurt. Most people live in co-ops, condos, or two-family houses. Most people are nice, but it can be noisy. You will hear cars playing music, and people driving fast in the morning. If you visit at night, you should be careful. Bensonhurt is safe, but some people can be mean. I was hurt by someone a long time ago. Recently, some people stole packages. This happens in many places. Also, people do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the ground every morning. My main problem is dog waste on the floor. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place without sidewalks. My house is on the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"exercise hill\" because many joggers like to run up it every day. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is not good and can be hard to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires are old and look bad. The area gets a lot of rain and wind, and branches often hit the power lines. This makes the wires look bad. There are many tall trees all around. But many people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built on the hill, with big windows on the top to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water and sky are colorful. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can find. I once left my car outside for a month and when I went to use it, it was covered with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school a few blocks away, but most people are old and retired. Many people have dogs. They are often seen running in the street or in people's yards. If you leave a door or window open, they may go inside. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. Rabbits are also in our area. They are big and the gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants and burrows in people's lawns. My cats like them, and they have caught most of them. We also see small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle. But the neighborhood crows chase it away. There are no stores near me, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, and you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a quiet neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. It is between two state highways. We get some traffic on our street. But most of the time, it is quiet. People do not move in and out of the neighborhood very much. So, I know most of the people who live here. They work in their yards and do daily tasks.\n\nIn the winter, we sled down a hill on our street. Our house is at the front of our street. We see people coming and going all day. When we see a new car, we take notice. Some of our neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. So, we are used to people seeing us come and go.\n\nWe go outside to play, even when it is raining. We sometimes grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We can hear lawn mowers every day from March to October. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a wooded area. There is a lot of shade, but also many leaves in the fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. The smell of burning leaves is nice.\n\nWe have not had much winter lately. It feels like a long fall. Our house has a garage at the back. We rarely use the front door. I like to work in the garage on my truck. When I open the garage doors, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is quiet. But when people from out of town visit, there are many cars. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the middle of the desert. The area is very dry and brown. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like to see only brown all the time. When I first moved here in the 1990s, the houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses, but it still looks like a small town. Many places are changing like this. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly. However, like any town, it has both good and bad parts. I am lucky to live in a nice area with friendly older people.\n\nThere are not many different stores here. We have big chain stores like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go to another town. The main jobs in my area are in construction. This is because the town is not very developed and there is a lot of empty land. This makes me a little worried. I moved from a big city, and I don't want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars.\n\nI like living here because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert climate and land make it hard for animals to survive. We should learn about the animals that live here to live in harmony with them. My family and I have adapted to the wildlife. My children love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them.\n\nThere are some fun things to do here. Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair to have a fun and interesting experience. If you visit in the winter, you can go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take skiing lessons. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, including rocks, artifacts, and objects that tell the story of the town's history and development.",
            "I live in a neighborhood on a college campus. My community is the people who live in my dormitory. I also consider the campus as my neighborhood. This might be different from what others think of when they hear the word \"neighborhood.\" However, my neighborhood has some things that are the same as other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses in my neighborhood. They are apartments, houses, and dormitory houses. The apartments have 2-4 people living in each room. There are about 20 people in each building. Some houses are rented by people who are connected to the school. These houses usually have 2-4 bedrooms. But there are not many of these houses. Most students live in dormitory houses. These houses have 2 people sharing a room. This is the most common kind of house in my neighborhood.\n\nMy school is proud of its diversity. This means that people from many cultures and ages live in my neighborhood. Some professors and older students live in houses. New students live in dormitory houses, and older students live in apartments. There are many stores in my neighborhood. They sell food and school clothes. You can buy what you need in my neighborhood. There is one park where everyone can play. The park is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my mom and little sister. We left behind our old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best life for us. They moved us to a new house in this neighborhood. It was a better place with a good school.\n\nAt first, I did not like it here. I missed my old home and friends. But I made new friends at school. I also met some people in the neighborhood who were nice. Mr. Glen and his children lived next door to us. They were kind to me and my family. I consider them like family. We had fun together. We went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was a happy day. I caught his wife's wedding strap, but I missed the flowers!\n\nThis neighborhood is like a big maze. But I have a GPS now, so I can explore it better. I like to walk around and visit my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games together and have fun. Sometimes I go to the park and enjoy nature. It helps me feel calm and peaceful.\n\nThe park has a basketball court and a tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and his friend Mr. Graves. They taught me how to play. We worked hard, but we had fun. Now I don't play as much, but it's nice to have the courts there.\n\nI have many happy memories of this neighborhood. I hope the best is yet to come.",
            "I live close to the college I attend. I like it because it's near the campus. There are many apartment buildings, some good restaurants, and fun bars. One of the bars changed its name and now costs more to visit. But the quality of service and drinks is not bad. Most people who live there are college students or have low incomes because the rent is not very high. There are many children in the area because a school is near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana, so the building manager put an air freshener near their door. This made my boyfriend and me laugh. It seems a little insulting. The buildings around me are old but might be nice inside. On the street, there are new apartments that are not well built. They are expensive, but the rent is high because they are near the campus. I do not like these apartments. A restaurant near me serves cheap food on paper plates. Most of their food is cooked in a microwave. There is a gas station near this restaurant that is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road near my apartment last year. Now the sidewalk is big, and there is grass on the sides of the road. This makes the area a little nicer. My apartment building has many trees. Some of them were cut down, but there are still many trees around me. Behind my building, there is a tree line and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street, but 43rd street is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street to hide the old buildings. The apartments on this street have a lot of problems. There is a lot of crime there. But I think I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are many good things near me, like the university and two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is very special. It has two houses connected together in a circle. They look like separate houses. The only difference is that each house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most of the people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk. The small children in the neighborhood play outside with toys, chalk or kites. This is nice in a world with many computers and machines. It feels like a different time. The neighborhood is near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and soft. However, this season we have had warnings about big storms and last night we heard a siren. We had to go to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and was nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail. After the storm, the road was hot and wet. The hail melted when it hit the ground. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I quickly took some pictures with my camera. The streets were quiet for a while after the storm. Then people started to come home from wherever they were. We went back to our normal routine. I love my neighborhood. I recently moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people in the South talk. I have a two-bedroom apartment. Everyone else in the neighborhood has the same kind. But the apartments are not all the same inside. Some are very small. I like to walk near a big field behind my house. I go to a small pond that is not a swimming pool. I have seen deer and in the morning I can hear a big frog singing. It is a great place to live near Charlotte. Every morning I hear roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. At first, it was hard for me to make friends. But I became close to two guys, one who lives two houses down from me and another who lives on my street. They are not living there anymore, but I still have good memories. Most of the people who were here when I moved here are still living here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburban neighborhoods. Our houses are mostly two-story. I hear kids playing outside on weekends when it is warm. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I have never had problems with my neighbors. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered packages online many times and never had them stolen from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends. I got hurt playing football, but I have many good memories there. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me think of happy times. Our neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. I can walk to Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food shops are popular, like in many neighborhoods. There are many good pizza places. We have many stores with everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There is even an Indian store where you can buy food to make at home or buy ready-made food. I like my neighborhood. I am grateful for my neighbors because I see many bad stories about neighborhoods on social media and the news.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special, but it is important for the agriculture industry. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign in the town. The town is mostly farms with peach trees or cows. Houses are far apart. They are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles. Most houses are not near the road. Instead, they are behind the fields where animals and crops grow. In the town center, there is one traffic light at a four-way stop. This is where you can find stores. There are three places to eat fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. People often go to a bigger store called Walmart in a nearby town to buy most of their food. The most popular store is Dollar General. It is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in Johnston for a long time. There is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels near the furniture store. They take care of pets. There are two small medical practices in the town. There is one elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Students go to school in the next town after fifth grade. There is a new park being built. It will be 2.5 acres. People will be able to play and visit. The town is small. There is not much to do. But it is a nice place to live.",
            "I learned about my area for the first time on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. Many apartments in the area cost more than one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story, and none of my friends knew about it either. Maybe it's because we have a hard time. I know some of my friends cry at night because life is expensive. But we have learned to be careful with money. We like old things, like toys from flea markets and old clothes. As we get older, we notice less. We may start smoking or get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on an old piano is a sign of adulthood. It smells bad, but it stays even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a store with unusual things. The streets can be crowded in the morning, but the stores are quiet. It's a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come here. It's a growing city, they say. One of the biggest online companies is here, and it's still trying to work out problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals, and nobody asks much from you. You can be alone if you want, and people will leave you alone. It's different from the South, where people care about each other. Here, you don't ask questions about people's lives. You can keep to yourself if you want. The city is a lively place. There is always something going on, like the pianist next door or the people singing upstairs. We are not just strangers in an apartment. We are friends who help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals, and we help each other when we can. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to be kind and helpful, and they do the same. We bring each other mail and help each other out. It's nice to see them, and I think they like my company too. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I'm not making a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is like many others. There are many houses that look the same. The homeowner's association is very strong here. This is why the houses are all in good condition. The yards are small and look the same. There is grass, pebbles and short driveways. Some houses have small trees. Everyone has a garage for two cars. The roads are good. They are paved and smooth. You will not find potholes here. Most of the houses are one story, but some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are big mailboxes at the end of the street. We use keys to get our mail. We also have two big boxes for packages.\n\nI live on the edge of a big city. My neighborhood is a mix of country and suburb. We have a lot of space. We have many community pools that are well maintained and locked. We also have walking paths where people walk their dogs or take a walk. You can get exercise without going to a park.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are old. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people. The city is big, but it has a small town feel. We have many things that people need. We have a big store with many things to buy. It takes 15 minutes to drive there. When we arrive, we have many choices. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell cheap things. All in all, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things. We are not close to big stores, but we can drive there easily.",
            "I live in a town in the middle of the United States. My home is near a big city, but not in the city itself. The area I live in is not rich. Most houses here are rented or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. There have been some violent crimes in the last ten years. Someone got killed in a fight near my house last year. But my family has been lucky. We have not been hurt by crime. Sometimes, we forget to bring things inside, and they get stolen. Our town has a big problem. Many people have died from taking too much of a strong drug called fentanyl. But we have help to stop this problem. There are places where people can get better and learn to live without the drug. Our school is very good. The teachers and staff are nice. My son goes to this school. He has problems, but he has not been bullied. The school makes sure all children have food to eat. They do not care if people do not have money. This is a good thing. The town is trying to make things better. They have fixed some roads and parks. But they have done more in the part of town where people go shopping. We wish they would do more for our part of town. Overall, I like living here. People are friendly, the school is good, and we have stores to buy what we need. Our house is not very valuable, but it is okay. We have lived here for a long time, and we like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. It is on a hill and has many old buildings. I live in a seven-story building near a famous theater. There is also a fun bar nearby that people like to go to on warm summer nights. Many people wait in line to get in, especially on weekends in June and July.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is located in the city and has a special wall around it with stairs. During the cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents near the park. They stay warm together and are close to a place where they can wash clothes and take a shower.\n\nBut what I like most about my neighborhood is the people. The area used to be known for violence, but the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city and their block. Some people say it is not safe for white people to walk around at night, but I think this is old news. I am not white, and the people in my neighborhood are kind to me. They quickly give me a jacket if I need one. The laundromat is also open late so I can charge my phone. Even on rainy days, people will give me money and tell me I am beautiful.\n\nI like walking around my neighborhood at night. The people here are kind and friendly. I feel at home here. I know that no matter where I go, my neighborhood will always be home.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. The area is mostly farmland and small tourist cities. There are no big city malls or big stores like Wal-mart or Target. If you need something, you have to drive to get it. But I live in a beautiful place. I am near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. My town is surrounded by water. I can walk to a beach and put my feet in the water.\n\nMy neighborhood is small and quiet. The houses are not stacked on top of each other. They are old and different from each other. Some houses have basements that you can see from the road. The houses are painted many different colors. Most have yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people grow food in their yards and have fences for their animals. My neighborhood looks like a typical American town. People work hard to make a living and raise their families.\n\nOn any day, you can see kids playing outside. People walk their dogs, ride bikes, and skate. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs in the neighborhood. You can see people grilling outside and say hello. The yards are well taken care of. The grass is mowed and trimmed. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nMy neighborhood is not very pretty, but it is a safe place to live. It has what people want: a safe place to be at the end of the day. Near my house, there is a police station and a jail. The health department and recycling center are also close. We have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers. There is a small airport next to the fields. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. I can walk to get ice cream from the local shop. It is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

But it takes a long time to travel to these places. The city is very big and traffic is very bad. It can take two hours to drive 10 miles.\n\nMost people in the city do not walk. They drive cars. The city is too big to walk around. Because of this, the traffic is very bad. It is hard to find a place to park a car.\n\nThe city is getting bigger. New apartment buildings are being built. Some people are happy about this. But others are not. They do not want more people in the city.\n\nMy neighborhood has many different kinds of houses. There are apartments, houses, and small buildings. Some have one family living in them. Others have two families. This is true in my neighborhood and in the neighborhoods around me.\n\nPeople of all ages live in my neighborhood. I do not know many of my neighbors. But I have good memories of my childhood. I used to play outside with my friends. We were all about the same age.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. It has many single-family houses. Some houses are divided into two parts, but they are still connected. My house has a small front yard and a small driveway to the side. Most houses look like the past. Living in the suburbs was once a great dream in America. But now, that dream is not as strong. My neighborhood still shows us the dream is still alive. Many people still visit and live here. The people are not as happy as they used to be. They do not take care of their yards as much. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children still play outside. A public school has been here for almost 90 years. It still shows children the future. It makes older people remember the past. There are few churches, but the basketball courts are still full. All houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big supermarket called Super A. It is owned by a Yemeni family. They are one of the few Arab families in the neighborhood. Many people here are African American. The streets are wide, and children play football. Most people have lived here for many years. They can tell stories about the past when everyone knew each other. There was a karate school, but it closed when people stopped wanting to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. People think medicine makes everything better. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Young people do not like it because it does not have new movies. Older people like it because it is a cheap way to go out. There is a big road that passes through our town. The entrance and exit are in the town next to ours. Some people wanted an exit for our town, but others did not. They thought it would ruin the town. The city council listened to the elders and said no. We are building a new high school. We are choosing a mascot for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good choice for us.",
            "You might not notice it at first. It looks just like a normal residential area behind a shopping strip. Not a place you would think people would want to live, right? But if you walk behind the old, empty store and look behind the hotels, you'll find a busy community. There are small apartment buildings next to each other, like blocks in a row. The first buildings you see have been in the news for some problems. Let's not talk too much about those. The other buildings are a different story. They are not well known to people who live in this area.\n\nNext to these buildings is a college. It's a small campus where students go to learn. They come in early in the morning, carrying coffee and yawning. A big gate opens slowly to let them in. People driving by on the road get angry when the gate blocks the way. The road meets another street with a park and a building where people go to get better after they hurt themselves. The building has nice chairs on the porch and a big fan that moves the hot air around. Children play in the park, running and spinning around. Bees fly around the flowers by the road. Older people take their dogs for walks on the path. They look at the teenagers on skateboards and the girls talking by the playground. There is a store that sells sushi in a shopping center near the park. It's cheap but never too busy. There's a store that sells pool supplies next to it, and a place to get a manicure. You can fill your pool while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken. That's the beauty of a shopping center. There's also a place that sells frozen yogurt. You can see the teenagers in the park with cold yogurt and toppings, doing tricks on their skateboards. This is a typical American neighborhood. It's a part of history in a quiet part of town where not much changes, not even time.",
            "We drove past many corn fields. They went on and on as far as the eye could see. \"Where is everything?\" she asked. I knew she was surprised by the empty space. She came from a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her house. She had never seen so much open space before.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio. I showed her a big lake with water. Near it was my home in a small group of houses. They were made of brick and stucco. Each house had a lot of land. People took care of their land and planted flowers. In the spring, the trees changed with the seasons. The driveways were filled with expensive cars. They shone in the sun after a car wash.\n\nI drove my car along the road to my house. It is made of grey stucco. My Korean neighbor was outside. He was always friendly and mowed his lawn every day. He sang over the noise of his lawn mower. Everyone liked him, but he had gotten older and a little slower. He was a doctor many years ago. He liked to hide behind his lawn mower.\n\nWe kept driving. Geese lived in my side yard. They ran from my dog. There was a small stream in the back that flowed into the lake. You could hear the stream, the frogs, and the cows from the nearby farms. There was a small bridge made of wood over the stream. On the other side was a special place with trees, herbs, and flowers. I spent most of my childhood there. I built forts and chased animals when I was a kid. I had many friends in the neighborhood. The winters were cold, but they were also beautiful. The trees were bare, and it snowed sometimes. We made snowmen and snow angels. My sister and I fought a lot when we were young. We used snowballs as weapons. We built forts to keep our snowballs safe. We played in our own winter wonderland.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a city with a special feeling. The city says its unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some people think this is a reminder of the past, when Portland was less known and less expensive. In those times, the city was home to many new and creative ideas. Others see it as a welcome to people who are different. They can be weird and be praised for it. Even though many new and rich people have moved to Portland, it is still a weird place. \"Weird\" does not mean everyone is free to do whatever they want. But it means people are accepting of things that others might not accept. Portland has modern things like other cities. People buy things made in China. There are many normal things in Portland, like yoga and hipsters and business people. Perhaps the weird thing about Portland is that people do not take these things too seriously. My neighborhood has colorful houses and flower gardens. There are free boxes along the street in the summer. Free boxes are boxes with things people are getting rid of. They can have clothes, books or anything. The fun of finding something new and interesting in a free box is part of what makes Portland special. But Portland is not perfect. It has problems like many other cities. There are people who do not like to accept things that are different. They like to do new and fun things like goat yoga or watch the local soccer team. Portland is full of people with different interests and passions. Some people are trying to make their dreams come true, while others are just enjoying the city. Portland also has problems with drugs and homelessness. These problems are not easy to solve. The city has good services for people in need, but they are not enough. Many people in the city do not know what to do about these problems.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are to the north. They see the sun each morning and each evening. They do not change. They do not care about our problems. They are strong and steady.\n\nWhen I am sad or stressed, I look at the mountains. They help me feel better. They give me strength to keep going. I moved to this place when I started college. The mountains near the school are what I first liked. The school has many beautiful buildings and ponds. But the mountains are special.\n\nThe town has many nice places. There are many cafés where people study and drink coffee. We can walk or take a bus to the town center. It is old and has a lot of history. The buildings are colorful and old. The town is not big. But it has a lot of energy like a big city. We can walk to the library to get away from the busy town.\n\nThis town is special. It has two different sides. It is quiet and peaceful, or it is busy and exciting. This makes it a fun place to live. I have many good memories here. I walk with friends in the park and visit the movie theater. But I also have sad memories. The ponds can be a good place to think or cry. I have spent many nights thinking about my life by the pond.\n\nOne time, I walked by the pond and the park. I looked up at the sun and saw the mountains. They were big and strong. They made me think about being strong and moving forward. They told me to keep going.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a hard time finding it. Public transportation is easy to use. Many people use it. Bensonhurt is a busy area. It feels like New York City. You will see many Asian stores. In the last twenty years, many Asian people moved to Bensonhurt. Now, you see an Asian store on almost every street. They sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, it costs less money, and it is easy to get.\n\nThere are many Asian supermarkets close to me. I can walk to four of them in two minutes. This is good because it is easy to buy food. Not all people in Bensonhurt are Asian. It is a diverse area. Many immigrants and their families live here. Most big businesses are owned by Asian people. There is a big park near here. It has many basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings, and a place for kids to play. You will see many different people in the park. They play and get along well.\n\nThere are not many big buildings in Bensonhurt. Most people live in co-ops, condos, or two-family houses. Most people are nice, but it can be noisy. You will hear cars playing music, and people driving fast in the morning. If you visit at night, you should be careful. Bensonhurt is safe, but some people can be mean. I was hurt by someone a long time ago. Recently, some people stole packages. This happens in many places. Also, people do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the ground every morning. My main problem is dog waste on the floor. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I live in a place without sidewalks. My house is on the top of the biggest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"exercise hill\" because many joggers like to run up it every day. There are no sidewalks on my street, so everyone walks on the road. The road is not good and can be hard to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires are old and look bad. The area gets a lot of rain and wind, and branches often hit the power lines. This makes the wires look bad. There are many tall trees all around. But many people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. That's why many houses are built on the hill, with big windows on the top to see the bay. It is beautiful at sunset when the water and sky are colorful. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on everything it can find. I once left my car outside for a month and when I went to use it, it was covered with moss. It took me three hours to clean it. There are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school a few blocks away, but most people are old and retired. Many people have dogs. They are often seen running in the street or in people's yards. If you leave a door or window open, they may go inside. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out. Rabbits are also in our area. They are big and the gardeners do not like them because they dig up plants and burrows in people's lawns. My cats like them, and they have caught most of them. We also see small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes a hawk or eagle. But the neighborhood crows chase it away. There are no stores near me, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There is no beach, but you can throw rocks into the water. The bay is not very wide, and you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a quiet neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. It is between two state highways. We get some traffic on our street. But most of the time, it is quiet. People do not move in and out of the neighborhood very much. So, I know most of the people who live here. They work in their yards and do daily tasks.\n\nIn the winter, we sled down a hill on our street. Our house is at the front of our street. We see people coming and going all day. When we see a new car, we take notice. Some of our neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride their bikes. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. So, we are used to people seeing us come and go.\n\nWe go outside to play, even when it is raining. We sometimes grill on our back deck. The smell of barbecue is nice. We can hear lawn mowers every day from March to October. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a wooded area. There is a lot of shade, but also many leaves in the fall. We rake and burn the leaves every year. The smell of burning leaves is nice.\n\nWe have not had much winter lately. It feels like a long fall. Our house has a garage at the back. We rarely use the front door. I like to work in the garage on my truck. When I open the garage doors, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, the neighborhood is quiet. But when people from out of town visit, there are many cars. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the middle of the desert. The area is very dry and brown. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like to see only brown all the time. When I first moved here in the 1990s, the houses were far apart. Now, there are more houses, but it still looks like a small town. Many places are changing like this. The people in my neighborhood are generally friendly. However, like any town, it has both good and bad parts. I am lucky to live in a nice area with friendly older people.\n\nThere are not many different stores here. We have big chain stores like Food for Less and Smart & Final. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go to another town. The main jobs in my area are in construction. This is because the town is not very developed and there is a lot of empty land. This makes me a little worried. I moved from a big city, and I don't want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bars.\n\nI like living here because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert climate and land make it hard for animals to survive. We should learn about the animals that live here to live in harmony with them. My family and I have adapted to the wildlife. My children love lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them.\n\nThere are some fun things to do here. Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair to have a fun and interesting experience. If you visit in the winter, you can go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take skiing lessons. If you are interested in the natural history and culture of the desert, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many interesting things to see, including rocks, artifacts, and objects that tell the story of the town's history and development.",
            "I live in a neighborhood on a college campus. My community is the people who live in my dormitory. I also consider the campus as my neighborhood. This might be different from what others think of when they hear the word \"neighborhood.\" However, my neighborhood has some things that are the same as other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores, and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses in my neighborhood. They are apartments, houses, and dormitory houses. The apartments have 2-4 people living in each room. There are about 20 people in each building. Some houses are rented by people who are connected to the school. These houses usually have 2-4 bedrooms. But there are not many of these houses. Most students live in dormitory houses. These houses have 2 people sharing a room. This is the most common kind of house in my neighborhood.\n\nMy school is proud of its diversity. This means that people from many cultures and ages live in my neighborhood. Some professors and older students live in houses. New students live in dormitory houses, and older students live in apartments. There are many stores in my neighborhood. They sell food and school clothes. You can buy what you need in my neighborhood. There is one park where everyone can play. The park is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. When I first came here, I was sad. I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge with my mom and little sister. We left behind our old home and friends. My mom and dad wanted the best life for us. They moved us to a new house in this neighborhood. It was a better place with a good school.\n\nAt first, I did not like it here. I missed my old home and friends. But I made new friends at school. I also met some people in the neighborhood who were nice. Mr. Glen and his children lived next door to us. They were kind to me and my family. I consider them like family. We had fun together. We went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was a happy day. I caught his wife's wedding strap, but I missed the flowers!\n\nThis neighborhood is like a big maze. But I have a GPS now, so I can explore it better. I like to walk around and visit my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games together and have fun. Sometimes I go to the park and enjoy nature. It helps me feel calm and peaceful.\n\nThe park has a basketball court and a tennis court. I used to play tennis with my dad and his friend Mr. Graves. They taught me how to play. We worked hard, but we had fun. Now I don't play as much, but it's nice to have the courts there.\n\nI have many happy memories of this neighborhood. I hope the best is yet to come.",
            "I live close to the college I attend. I like it because it's near the campus. There are many apartment buildings, some good restaurants, and fun bars. One of the bars changed its name and now costs more to visit. But the quality of service and drinks is not bad. Most people who live there are college students or have low incomes because the rent is not very high. There are many children in the area because a school is near my apartment. I do not know my neighbors very well. They smoke a lot of marijuana, so the building manager put an air freshener near their door. This made my boyfriend and me laugh. It seems a little insulting. The buildings around me are old but might be nice inside. On the street, there are new apartments that are not well built. They are expensive, but the rent is high because they are near the campus. I do not like these apartments. A restaurant near me serves cheap food on paper plates. Most of their food is cooked in a microwave. There is a gas station near this restaurant that is not a good place to work. But the city fixed the road near my apartment last year. Now the sidewalk is big, and there is grass on the sides of the road. This makes the area a little nicer. My apartment building has many trees. Some of them were cut down, but there are still many trees around me. Behind my building, there is a tree line and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street, but 43rd street is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street to hide the old buildings. The apartments on this street have a lot of problems. There is a lot of crime there. But I think I like where I live. It's affordable, and there are many good things near me, like the university and two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is very special. It has two houses connected together in a circle. They look like separate houses. The only difference is that each house is painted yellow with a white porch and a green metal roof. Most of the people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a driveway some evenings and talk. The small children in the neighborhood play outside with toys, chalk or kites. This is nice in a world with many computers and machines. It feels like a different time. The neighborhood is near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and soft. However, this season we have had warnings about big storms and last night we heard a siren. We had to go to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and was nervous. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of big hail. After the storm, the road was hot and wet. The hail melted when it hit the ground. Then the sun came out and it started to rain. I saw a beautiful rainbow. I quickly took some pictures with my camera. The streets were quiet for a while after the storm. Then people started to come home from wherever they were. We went back to our normal routine. I love my neighborhood. I recently moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people in the South talk. I have a two-bedroom apartment. Everyone else in the neighborhood has the same kind. But the apartments are not all the same inside. Some are very small. I like to walk near a big field behind my house. I go to a small pond that is not a swimming pool. I have seen deer and in the morning I can hear a big frog singing. It is a great place to live near Charlotte. Every morning I hear roosters crowing from nearby farms. It feels like living in a small village. We even have a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. At first, it was hard for me to make friends. But I became close to two guys, one who lives two houses down from me and another who lives on my street. They are not living there anymore, but I still have good memories. Most of the people who were here when I moved here are still living here. My neighborhood is like many other American suburban neighborhoods. Our houses are mostly two-story. I hear kids playing outside on weekends when it is warm. The neighborhood is usually quiet during the week. I have never had problems with my neighbors. They leave me alone unless I need help. I have ordered packages online many times and never had them stolen from my porch. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with my friends. I got hurt playing football, but I have many good memories there. Now, I go to the park with my cousin's kids. They like playing on swings and slides. The park makes me think of happy times. Our neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. I can walk to Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. But many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered. Fast food shops are popular, like in many neighborhoods. There are many good pizza places. We have many stores with everything we need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There is even an Indian store where you can buy food to make at home or buy ready-made food. I like my neighborhood. I am grateful for my neighbors because I see many bad stories about neighborhoods on social media and the news.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not special, but it is important for the agriculture industry. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is written on a sign in the town. The town is mostly farms with peach trees or cows. Houses are far apart. They are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles. Most houses are not near the road. Instead, they are behind the fields where animals and crops grow. In the town center, there is one traffic light at a four-way stop. This is where you can find stores. There are three places to eat fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizzeria, but it closed. There is a family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. People often go to a bigger store called Walmart in a nearby town to buy most of their food. The most popular store is Dollar General. It is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in Johnston for a long time. There is a pet groomer called Clark's Cuts and Kennels near the furniture store. They take care of pets. There are two small medical practices in the town. There is one elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Students go to school in the next town after fifth grade. There is a new park being built. It will be 2.5 acres. People will be able to play and visit. The town is small. There is not much to do. But it is a nice place to live.",
            "I learned about my area for the first time on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. Many apartments in the area cost more than one thousand dollars a month. I had not heard about this story, and none of my friends knew about it either. Maybe it's because we have a hard time. I know some of my friends cry at night because life is expensive. But we have learned to be careful with money. We like old things, like toys from flea markets and old clothes. As we get older, we notice less. We may start smoking or get used to things being a certain way. But the flea market is always there. The smell of old magazines on an old piano is a sign of adulthood. It smells bad, but it stays even after you clean it.\n\nThere are three second-hand stores near my home. If you start from the far side, you can visit two charity stores, a library, a rare book store, and a store with unusual things. The streets can be crowded in the morning, but the stores are quiet. It's a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more cars and people come here. It's a growing city, they say. One of the biggest online companies is here, and it's still trying to work out problems. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals, and nobody asks much from you. You can be alone if you want, and people will leave you alone. It's different from the South, where people care about each other. Here, you don't ask questions about people's lives. You can keep to yourself if you want. The city is a lively place. There is always something going on, like the pianist next door or the people singing upstairs. We are not just strangers in an apartment. We are friends who help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals, and we help each other when we can. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to be kind and helpful, and they do the same. We bring each other mail and help each other out. It's nice to see them, and I think they like my company too. I live in a big, modern city, but my neighbors make me feel like I'm not making a mistake with my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburb. My neighborhood is like many others. There are many houses that look the same. The homeowner's association is very strong here. This is why the houses are all in good condition. The yards are small and look the same. There is grass, pebbles and short driveways. Some houses have small trees. Everyone has a garage for two cars. The roads are good. They are paved and smooth. You will not find potholes here. Most of the houses are one story, but some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are big mailboxes at the end of the street. We use keys to get our mail. We also have two big boxes for packages.\n\nI live on the edge of a big city. My neighborhood is a mix of country and suburb. We have a lot of space. We have many community pools that are well maintained and locked. We also have walking paths where people walk their dogs or take a walk. You can get exercise without going to a park.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are old. It is a safe place. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young people. The city is big, but it has a small town feel. We have many things that people need. We have a big store with many things to buy. It takes 15 minutes to drive there. When we arrive, we have many choices. We have stores that sell healthy food and stores that sell cheap things. All in all, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things. We are not close to big stores, but we can drive there easily.",
            "I live in a town in the middle of the United States. My home is near a big city, but not in the city itself. The area I live in is not rich. Most houses here are rented or owned by people who do not have a lot of money. But it is not a bad place. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. There have been some violent crimes in the last ten years. Someone got killed in a fight near my house last year. But my family has been lucky. We have not been hurt by crime. Sometimes, we forget to bring things inside, and they get stolen. Our town has a big problem. Many people have died from taking too much of a strong drug called fentanyl. But we have help to stop this problem. There are places where people can get better and learn to live without the drug. Our school is very good. The teachers and staff are nice. My son goes to this school. He has problems, but he has not been bullied. The school makes sure all children have food to eat. They do not care if people do not have money. This is a good thing. The town is trying to make things better. They have fixed some roads and parks. But they have done more in the part of town where people go shopping. We wish they would do more for our part of town. Overall, I like living here. People are friendly, the school is good, and we have stores to buy what we need. Our house is not very valuable, but it is okay. We have lived here for a long time, and we like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is very interesting. It is on a hill and has many old buildings. I live in a seven-story building near a famous theater. There is also a fun bar nearby that people like to go to on warm summer nights. Many people wait in line to get in, especially on weekends in June and July.\n\nNearby is a big park. It is located in the city and has a special wall around it with stairs. During the cold winter months, some people without homes set up tents near the park. They stay warm together and are close to a place where they can wash clothes and take a shower.\n\nBut what I like most about my neighborhood is the people. The area used to be known for violence, but the people work hard to keep it clean. They care about their city and their block. Some people say it is not safe for white people to walk around at night, but I think this is old news. I am not white, and the people in my neighborhood are kind to me. They quickly give me a jacket if I need one. The laundromat is also open late so I can charge my phone. Even on rainy days, people will give me money and tell me I am beautiful.\n\nI like walking around my neighborhood at night. The people here are kind and friendly. I feel at home here. I know that no matter where I go, my neighborhood will always be home.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. The area is mostly farmland and small tourist cities. There are no big city malls or big stores like Wal-mart or Target. If you need something, you have to drive to get it. But I live in a beautiful place. I am near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. My town is surrounded by water. I can walk to a beach and put my feet in the water.\n\nMy neighborhood is small and quiet. The houses are not stacked on top of each other. They are old and different from each other. Some houses have basements that you can see from the road. The houses are painted many different colors. Most have yards with trampolines and playsets. Some people grow food in their yards and have fences for their animals. My neighborhood looks like a typical American town. People work hard to make a living and raise their families.\n\nOn any day, you can see kids playing outside. People walk their dogs, ride bikes, and skate. Neighbors know each other and can tell who belongs in the neighborhood. You can see people grilling outside and say hello. The yards are well taken care of. The grass is mowed and trimmed. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nMy neighborhood is not very pretty, but it is a safe place to live. It has what people want: a safe place to be at the end of the day. Near my house, there is a police station and a jail. The health department and recycling center are also close. We have baseball and softball fields where you can hear the announcers. There is a small airport next to the fields. You can hear the planes taking off and landing. I can walk to get ice cream from the local shop. It is a great place to live."
