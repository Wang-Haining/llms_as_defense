            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

But then I can walk to the library and be in a quiet place.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. One is busy and exciting. The other is quiet and peaceful. This makes the town interesting. I have many happy memories of my time here. I walk with my friends in the park or go to a movie in the college theater. But I also have sad memories. I have cried by the pond in the middle of the night when I was feeling unhappy.\n\nI like to walk by the pond and look at the turtles and ducks. They live their lives and do their jobs. This makes me think about my own life and what I want to do. I wonder if I have a purpose. I walk to the main street and look at the mountains. They are always there. They are strong and still. They make me feel strong and able to go on.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a hard time finding it. The neighborhood is easy to reach by public transportation. It is one of the most popular ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a busy area with many Asian stores. This is because many Asian people have moved to the area in the last twenty years. You will see an Asian store on almost every block as you walk. These stores often sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, the prices are low, and they are convenient. There are several Asian stores near where I live. In fact, I can walk to four stores in just a few minutes. This makes it easy to buy groceries. Bensonhurst is not all Asian people. It is a diverse area with people from different countries and their families. Many big stores in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby with a basketball court, a field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, a playground for kids, and a water fountain for kids to play in during the summer. The park is also a place where people from different backgrounds can play together. In Bensonhurst, you will not see many big buildings for companies. Most buildings are apartments for people who own them together, or houses. Many people live in two-family houses. The people in this area are generally nice, but they can be loud. Every day, you will hear loud music from cars driving by or people speeding. If you visit at night, be careful. While Bensonhurst is safe, you might meet people who want to cause trouble. I have had some problems with people in the past, but it was a long time ago. There is also a problem with people stealing packages. This is a common problem in many areas. Another problem is that people do not follow the rules about cleaning up after their dogs. Every morning, you will see dog waste on the sidewalk as you walk to the train or the store. My biggest complaint is the dog waste on the sidewalks everywhere I go. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I do not live on a street with many sidewalks. My house is at the top of the biggest hill in my neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many people like to run up it. There is no sidewalk on my street. So, everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good condition. In some places, it is pitted. This can be a problem for drivers. The telephone and electric wires around the block look old. They are often damaged in storms. We get many storms and rainfalls in my area. This causes branches to fall on the power lines. The repairs make the lines look old and broken.\n\nThere are many tall trees here. But people do not like them. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are high up on the hill. They have big windows on the top floor to see the ocean.\n\nThe view is beautiful at sunset. The water in the bay looks nice. The sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy. This makes the sunlight weak. Most days are overcast and damp.\n\nMoss grows on everything here, including roofs, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month. It got moss and looked funny. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school nearby. Most people are older and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs run around the neighborhood. They like to jump into yards or run in the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might get in. I once found a dog in my house. I had to chase it out.\n\nRabbits are common in my neighborhood. They are big and like to dig up plants and burrow into yards. My cats like to chase them. They have made most of the rabbits leave.\n\nWe have many birds here, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even through the mist.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My home is in a quiet neighborhood. It's a street between two big roads, so we see some cars all the time. But it's not too busy. Many people in the neighborhood are friendly. They take care of their yards. In the winter, we like to sled down a hill near our house. Our home is at the corner of the street, so we see everyone who comes and goes. When we see a strange car, we take notice.\n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and play. We like to go outside and play, even when it's raining. We have a big deck where we grill food. It smells good when we cook outside. We hear lawn mowers a lot from March to October. Our neighborhood was once a forest, so there are many trees and shade. We have to clean up leaves in the fall. It's a lot of work, but the smell of burning leaves is nice.\n\nWe don't have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of the house. We don't use the front door much. I like to work in the garage on my truck. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet. But sometimes we see many cars because family members visit from other places. I like living here. If the street weren't a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "My home is in the middle of the desert. It is a dry and brown place. People who live here are used to seeing so much dirt. If you don't live here, you might not understand this. When I lived here in the nineteen nineties, there were not many houses. Now there are more. The area is changing like many places. People here are usually friendly. But, like in any city, there are good and bad things. I live near old people who are kind. My neighborhood is nice.\n\nThere are not many stores in my area. Most are big chains. You can buy food at places like Food for Less or Smart. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Most people in my city work in construction. This is because the city is growing and there is still much empty space. I work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like my job.\n\nI like my home because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is a hard place for animals to live. We need to learn about the animals that live here so we can coexist peacefully. My family and I like the animals. My children are excited to see lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them.\n\nIf you visit my area, there are some things to see. Victorville is good for families who want to experience the desert. You can go to the San Bernardino County Fair. It is a fun event. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the mountains and ski. If you want to learn about the desert's history and culture, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has interesting objects and stories about the area.",
            "I am different from other people who live in a neighborhood. I do not live in a house with a family. Instead, I live in a college. My neighborhood is the people and the buildings on my college campus. My dorm is my home. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood.\n\nMy neighborhood has many buildings. Some are big and have many rooms. These are called apartments. Many students live in these buildings. Each building has about 20 people. Some buildings are small and have only a few rooms. These are not very common.\n\nThere are also houses that students can rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. But not many students live in these houses.\n\nMost students live in dorm rooms. These rooms are shared with one other person. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from many cultures and countries live here. The people who run the college, like professors and staff, live in the houses. Students live in the apartments and dorm rooms. We all come together to make a community.\n\nMy neighborhood has many stores. We have places to eat, buy food, and buy school clothes. We have everything we need right here.\n\nOur campus has a park. It is a safe and clean place for everyone to go. We take care of it together.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. I moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was sad at first because I missed my old home and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a new place with good housing and a good high school. \n\nIt took some time, but I got used to the new neighborhood. I made some new friends and some new enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are nice people and I consider them like family. I remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun and I was happy to be there. I caught a white strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but I did not catch the flowers.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I use a GPS to help me find my way. I like to explore and have fun with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games and enjoy life together. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I like to bring sticks and practice my balance, and I like to bring my wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. My dad taught me and my friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a lot of fun, but we were also very tired. The neighborhood has many good memories for me. I am glad I lived here and I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I like my neighborhood. It is near the college I attend. This is good for me because I can walk to class. The neighborhood has many apartment buildings. Some of these buildings are old, but they have been fixed up. There are a few restaurants and bars in the area. These places are fun to visit and not too expensive.\n\nOne of the bars recently changed its name. It is more expensive than the others. But the service and drinks are not bad. Most people in the neighborhood are nice. They are students or they have low incomes because the apartments are not very expensive.\n\nThere are many children in the area because there is a school nearby. I do not know my neighbors. But I do not want to know them. They smoke a lot of marijuana, and my landlord put a machine to freshen the air in front of their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny.\n\nThe buildings around me look old, but they have new things inside. Some people live in new buildings down the street. But I do not like them. I think they are poorly built, and the rent is too high. They are near the college, so the owners can charge a lot of money.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates, and most of the food is cooked in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard that it is a bad place to work.\n\nThe city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now the sidewalk is big and there is grass on the sides of the road. This makes the area look nicer. But my apartment building is covered in trees. Some of the trees were cut down, and there are stumps left. There are many more trees near my home than on the other street.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. But 43rd Street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look bad. There are many trees on this street, but they hide the way the buildings look. There is a lot of crime on this street. But I think my area is okay. I can afford it, and there are many useful things near my home. I like that the college is close, and there are two bus stops so I can go to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses on a circle street. The houses look like separate homes, but they are part of a larger building. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of our driveways some evenings and talk while the children play outside. It is a good feeling in this world with many machines and computers. It is like being in the past. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But we have a problem. There are storms with strong winds called tornadoes. This season, we have had warnings. Last night, we heard the sirens and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of big ice pieces falling from the sky. After the storm, the street was hot and the ice melted. It was very hot outside, but then it started to rain. I saw a beautiful color in the sky, like a big rainbow. I quickly took a picture with my camera. Then, people slowly came home from where they were. It was quiet again, and then it was like normal. Parents and children were outside, and dinner was cooking. I like my neighborhood. I recently moved from one state to another. I love the way people talk in this new place. I live in a two-bedroom apartment, like most of my neighbors. But some apartments are small. It doesn't make sense to me. I like to walk in the big field behind my home and go to the pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a good place to live, not too far from the city. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to enter eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to a boy who lives next door and another boy on my street. Neither of them lives there now, but I still think about the good times we had. Most of the people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. It has two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside when it is warm. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. People are friendly and do not bother you unless you need help. I have ordered packages online many times and never had them stolen. I trust my neighbors. A park is close to my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt there playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now, I go to the park to visit my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and reminds me of my childhood. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There are also fast food places and pizza shops. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. Some stores are different, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I see stories on social media and the news about people having problems with their neighbors, and I am grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns in the area. But it has a big job in the agriculture business. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town is proud of this title and has a sign that says so.\n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. There are many peach trees and cattle. Most of the houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer. Or they have gray shingles. The houses are far away from the road. They are near fields where people grow food for animals.\n\nIn the middle of the town, there is one traffic light. This is where the only stores are. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. But people often go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things and is busy all day.\n\nThere is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. The owner is kind and well-known in the community. She has been in business for a long time and delivers furniture to people's homes. Next to the furniture store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of dogs and other animals. There is a doctor's office and a vet's office in the town. They are small, but good at their jobs. There is an elementary school in the town. But when kids get a little older, they go to school in another town.\n\nThere is no park in the town, but they are building a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. The town is small, so there is not much to do. There is no movie theater, no bowling alley, and no place to walk your dog. But it is a nice town. You can drive through it quickly and not notice it's there.",
            "The first time I heard about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who went missing. It surprised me. Almost every apartment in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's because of the hard times. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. It is expensive, but we have learned to be careful with money. You start to like the smell of old toys from flea markets and old clothes that are not used. You smell less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just get used to things being like this. But flea markets always exist. The smell of adulthood is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in the leather even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three thrift stores near my home that I can walk to. If I start on one side, I can visit two stores that sell used things for charity, a library, a store that sells rare books, and a store that sells strange things. Downtown is crowded, with many cars and people. But it is quiet in the thrift stores. You cannot hear the noise of cars and people from inside. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more people and cars come to this area. It is a growing city, they say. It is home to a big company that sells things online and delivers them. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals, and nobody asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It is different from the South, where people care about each other. You do not ask questions about each other's lives here. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will be busy like the sea. It is a lively place to be. There is always something happening, like music from the pianist next door or singing from the people upstairs. We have less of an apartment with strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other when we need it, celebrate birthdays, and mourn when someone dies. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring mail to my neighbors, and they bring it to me. It is nice to see them, and I think they like my presence as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but it is my neighbors who make me feel like I did not completely ruin my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is very neat and clean. A homeowner's group helps keep everything looking good. You see many single-family homes with well-maintained lawns. Each lawn has small trees, grass, and pebbles. Every house has a two-car garage. The streets are in good condition. They are paved and smooth. You will not see any holes in the road. Most houses have one floor, but some have two. There are no mailboxes in front of each house. There is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. People use a key to get their mail. There are two large boxes for packages. We have a lot of space because our neighborhood is on the edge of the nearby city. It is like a mix of country and suburban areas. We have many things here. There are community swimming pools and walking paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can get exercise by walking around the neighborhood. Many people in our community are retired. It is a safe area. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young professionals living here. The city is big in population but feels small. It has many things you need. We have one big shopping center. It is not very big, but it has what you need. It takes 15 minutes to drive to any important place. After that, you can find many stores. Some stores sell healthy food, and others sell things at low prices. In general, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things here, like pools and walking paths. We can easily drive to any big store we want.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town near a big city. It is a town with a lower income area. My neighborhood is on the east side. The houses here are not expensive. Many people live here who have low incomes. However, the neighborhood is not ugly or unpleasant. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nThere is a little more crime here than in other areas of the town. There have been some violent crimes, like shootings and one murder. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting. But my family has not been hurt by crime. We have lost some things if we left them outside.\n\nThe town has a problem with the \"opioid epidemic.\" Many people have died from overdoses. But there are places to help people with addiction. We have programs to stop people from dying from overdoses.\n\nMy town has good and bad things. The elementary school is good. The teachers and staff are helpful. My son likes going to school. They have programs to make sure kids do not get bullied. All kids get free food at school. No one is treated unfairly because they do not have money.\n\nThe town's leaders have made the town look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But most of these changes happened in the center of town and where people shop. My neighborhood does not get as much attention. This is a problem for us.\n\nI like living in this town. People are kind. The schools are good. There are stores to buy what we need. Our house is not worth much money, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for a long time. I do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting place. It is built on a hill. The buildings in my neighborhood are old and important. I live in a big apartment building with seven stories. It is across the street from an old theater. A short walk away is a fun bar that is popular on warm nights. People of different kinds come to this bar. Many people want to go in, especially in June and July on weekends. A little further away is a big park. The park is good for the area. Around the park, there are steps and concrete walls. In cold weather, some people sleep in tents on the sidewalk and steps. They make their tents in a row. They do this to stay warm. It doesn't snow much here, but it rains a lot. The rain makes it hard to stay warm. They stay in the city because it is warmer and near a place where they can take a shower.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not just the old buildings that I like. What I like is the people. My neighborhood used to be a bad place with a lot of violence. People still talk about this. They talk about when the police and the DEA came to clean up the streets. The people remember. They still work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their town. They tell people not to walk around at night if they are white. I think this is not true. I think it is because of old ways of thinking. Maybe I am accepted here because I am not white. Or maybe the people here see that I understand their problems. I know that racism and unfair ideas are still a problem. This is true even in a place that is supposed to be welcoming to everyone. I like my neighborhood. I like the people. I feel alive when I am walking around at night. People are kind to me. They help me when I need it. This is a place where people are real.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in a rural area. You can see farms and small cities. There is no big store like Walmart or Target. You must drive to find what you need. But my home is in a beautiful place. I live near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you can find a place to swim.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some are old and some are new. Most houses have a basement. You can see the basement from the road. Many houses have old aluminum siding. The houses are all different colors. Most houses have yards. Some yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The houses look like they belong in America. People work hard to make a living. They raise families or have raised families. You can see kids playing outside. You can see people walking dogs, riding bikes, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who lives here and who does not. You can see people grilling outside and wave. You can see people walking their dogs and smile. The lawns are well taken care of. People do not leave leaves on the ground. The grass is short and neat. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nThis neighborhood is not very pretty, but it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful. It is safe. There are important places near our neighborhood. The police station and jail are nearby. The health department is close. We have a place where people take things they do not need to the garbage. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the people keeping score. You can hear the planes flying in and out of our small airport. You can walk to get ice cream. You can walk to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is a good place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My home is in a big city. The city is very different from one place to another. One place can be a home for people, and the next place can be a store or a restaurant. There are many stores and restaurants. Some stores are big and famous. Others are small and new. Some people like to visit these stores. Some stores are in big buildings called malls. Others are on the street. The streets are not always quiet. They are near homes where people live.\n\nThere are also parks in the city. People like to visit these parks with their children. My city is home to many different kinds of people. In one place, there are many people from the LGBTQ+ community. There are also many Jewish people. And there are people from the Soviet Union. The city is very big. There are many different communities in the city. Some of these communities are near my home. There are Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These are just a few of the many communities.\n\nBut the city is very big. It takes a long time to get from one place to another. People do not like to walk. The city has very bad traffic. It is hard to find a place to park. The city is building more and more homes. Some people like this. Others do not. They do not want more people in the city. They do not want more cars on the road.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes in the city. Some people live in big buildings. Others live in small houses. Some houses are for one family. Others are for two families. This is true in my neighborhood. There are many different kinds of homes. There are people of all ages in my neighborhood. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not very close. But when I was a child, I played with my neighbors. We had fun together.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family homes. But some have been divided into two, connected to each other. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway to the left. It looks like a home from a long time ago. This was the American dream. But now things are different. The dream is not as strong as it was. My neighborhood still looks nice. But the people are not as happy. The yards are not as clean. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside. The public school is old. It has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks good. It makes the children think about their future. It makes the older people remember the past. There are a few churches, but they are not very full. The basketball courts are always busy. All the houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a family from Yemen. They are the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people are African American. The streets are wide and the children play football. They stop playing to let the cars pass. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for a long time. They know each other's families. There used to be a karate school. But it closed when people stopped watching karate movies. Now it is a pharmacy. People think medicine can solve any problem. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a low price. The children do not like it. But the older people do. They think it is a good way to have fun. There is a highway that goes through our town. But it does not come into our town. We tried to get an entrance, but the older people did not want it. They said it would ruin our town. The town is building a new school. We are choosing a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good choice.",
            "You might not see it at first glance. This area is behind a shopping strip. It does not look like a place where people live. But if you go behind the old, empty store called Whole Foods, you can find a community. You have to walk behind the hotels that are empty most of the time.\n\nThese hotels are only used sometimes. They are for family reunions in the summer. There are many apartment buildings in this community. They are next to each other. They look like they were built to be together.\n\nThe first apartments you see have had bad things happen there. We will not talk about them too much. Appearances can be deceiving. But the other buildings are a different story. Almost nobody in this area knows about them.\n\nAcross from these buildings is a college. It is a small part of a bigger college. Students go there. They drink coffee and wake up early in the morning. The gates of the college open slowly to let them in. The students go to class. People driving by get angry because the students are holding up traffic.\n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park on one side and a place where people go to get better after they break a bone. The people who run this place have nice chairs outside. They have a fan that moves the air around. Children play in the park. They spin around and fall down in the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road.\n\nOld people walk their dogs. They look at the teenagers on skateboards and the girls talking about boys and YouTube. There is a place to eat sushi nearby. It is cheap, but it is not busy. There is also a store to buy things for the pool. You can get a haircut and food at the same time. There is a place to buy frozen yogurt too. Teenagers eat frozen yogurt and do tricks on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a part of America. It is a small piece of history in a quiet part of the south. Nothing much changes here. Even time seems to stand still.",
            "She looked out at the corn fields. \"Where are we?\" she asked. I said, \"This is it!\" I knew she would be surprised to see so much open space. She was from a town where the grocery store was close to her house. She had never seen so much open land before. I told her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio. She finally understood where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a two-lane road. We passed a quarry with water. Then we came to a small development where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard, and everyone takes care of them. In the spring, the yards have many flowers and trees. The driveways have nice cars like Mercedes-Benz. They shine in the sunlight after a car wash.\n\nI went to my house, a grey stucco house. My Korean neighbor was outside. He was happy to see me. He was always mowing his lawn and singing. People in the neighborhood liked him. He was a nice person with a special history. He was a doctor a long time ago. He is older now and not as funny. He uses a John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nMy house is near a stream. There are many geese and a Terrier. The stream goes into the quarry. You can hear the bullfrogs, the stream, and the cows from the nearby farms. Across the stream is a special place. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I played there a lot as a child. I built forts and chased animals. I had friends to play with. The winters were very cold, but they were beautiful. The trees were bare, and it snowed sometimes. We made snowmen and snow angels. My sister and I played together, even though we fought sometimes. We built forts to keep our snowballs safe. We played pretend in our own little world.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special place. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This means that people in Portland are not afraid to be different. They like things that are not normal. Portland was once a small, cheap city with its own unique culture. But now, many people from California are moving here, and the city is becoming more expensive. Still, Portland is weird in a good way. It means we accept things that others do not. We have all the modern things people want. We buy many things from China. But we also have a lot of things that are not modern. We have people who practice yoga, and people who like hipsters. We even have businesspeople. Maybe being weird just means we do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, the houses are colorful. The streets are lined with gardens full of flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In the summer, people put boxes on the street with things they no longer want. These boxes are called \"free boxes.\" They can have anything in them. Sometimes they have clothes and books. But they can have anything. Walking through my neighborhood is like a treasure hunt. You never know what you might find.\n\nPortland has many different kinds of people. Some people would never pick clothes out of a box on the street. They might go to yoga with goats or watch the city soccer team play. Portland is full of people who love many things. We are also full of people who want to achieve their dreams. But some people have mental health problems that make them turn to drugs. The rain and gray skies in Portland do not help. We also have a problem with homelessness. Many people come to Portland because we have good social services. But we do not have enough services to help everyone. The people who live here are not sure what to do about it. We are not weird when it comes to this problem.",
            "The mountains are always there. They stand in the north, watching the sun rise and set every day. I often forget they are there, but they do not change. They stand strong and still, no matter what happens in my life. When I am stressed and worried, the mountains call to me. When I look at them, I feel a little better. They give me strength to go on. \n\nI first saw the mountains when I started college. They are near the university where I study. The college has many beautiful buildings and a nice pond. But the mountains are special to me. They have a special place in my heart.\n\nThe rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafes where I study and drink coffee. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is an old part of town with old buildings. It is a fun place to be. But then I can walk to the library and be in a quiet place.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. One is busy and exciting. The other is quiet and peaceful. This makes the town interesting. I have many happy memories of my time here. I walk with my friends in the park or go to a movie in the college theater. But I also have sad memories. I have cried by the pond in the middle of the night when I was feeling unhappy.\n\nI like to walk by the pond and look at the turtles and ducks. They live their lives and do their jobs. This makes me think about my own life and what I want to do. I wonder if I have a purpose. I walk to the main street and look at the mountains. They are always there. They are strong and still. They make me feel strong and able to go on.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a hard time finding it. The neighborhood is easy to reach by public transportation. It is one of the most popular ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a busy area with many Asian stores. This is because many Asian people have moved to the area in the last twenty years. You will see an Asian store on almost every block as you walk. These stores often sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, the prices are low, and they are convenient. There are several Asian stores near where I live. In fact, I can walk to four stores in just a few minutes. This makes it easy to buy groceries. Bensonhurst is not all Asian people. It is a diverse area with people from different countries and their families. Many big stores in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby with a basketball court, a field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, a playground for kids, and a water fountain for kids to play in during the summer. The park is also a place where people from different backgrounds can play together. In Bensonhurst, you will not see many big buildings for companies. Most buildings are apartments for people who own them together, or houses. Many people live in two-family houses. The people in this area are generally nice, but they can be loud. Every day, you will hear loud music from cars driving by or people speeding. If you visit at night, be careful. While Bensonhurst is safe, you might meet people who want to cause trouble. I have had some problems with people in the past, but it was a long time ago. There is also a problem with people stealing packages. This is a common problem in many areas. Another problem is that people do not follow the rules about cleaning up after their dogs. Every morning, you will see dog waste on the sidewalk as you walk to the train or the store. My biggest complaint is the dog waste on the sidewalks everywhere I go. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I do not live on a street with many sidewalks. My house is at the top of the biggest hill in my neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many people like to run up it. There is no sidewalk on my street. So, everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good condition. In some places, it is pitted. This can be a problem for drivers. The telephone and electric wires around the block look old. They are often damaged in storms. We get many storms and rainfalls in my area. This causes branches to fall on the power lines. The repairs make the lines look old and broken.\n\nThere are many tall trees here. But people do not like them. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are high up on the hill. They have big windows on the top floor to see the ocean.\n\nThe view is beautiful at sunset. The water in the bay looks nice. The sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy. This makes the sunlight weak. Most days are overcast and damp.\n\nMoss grows on everything here, including roofs, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month. It got moss and looked funny. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school nearby. Most people are older and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs run around the neighborhood. They like to jump into yards or run in the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might get in. I once found a dog in my house. I had to chase it out.\n\nRabbits are common in my neighborhood. They are big and like to dig up plants and burrow into yards. My cats like to chase them. They have made most of the rabbits leave.\n\nWe have many birds here, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even through the mist.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My home is in a quiet neighborhood. It's a street between two big roads, so we see some cars all the time. But it's not too busy. Many people in the neighborhood are friendly. They take care of their yards. In the winter, we like to sled down a hill near our house. Our home is at the corner of the street, so we see everyone who comes and goes. When we see a strange car, we take notice.\n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and play. We like to go outside and play, even when it's raining. We have a big deck where we grill food. It smells good when we cook outside. We hear lawn mowers a lot from March to October. Our neighborhood was once a forest, so there are many trees and shade. We have to clean up leaves in the fall. It's a lot of work, but the smell of burning leaves is nice.\n\nWe don't have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of the house. We don't use the front door much. I like to work in the garage on my truck. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet. But sometimes we see many cars because family members visit from other places. I like living here. If the street weren't a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "My home is in the middle of the desert. It is a dry and brown place. People who live here are used to seeing so much dirt. If you don't live here, you might not understand this. When I lived here in the nineteen nineties, there were not many houses. Now there are more. The area is changing like many places. People here are usually friendly. But, like in any city, there are good and bad things. I live near old people who are kind. My neighborhood is nice.\n\nThere are not many stores in my area. Most are big chains. You can buy food at places like Food for Less or Smart. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Most people in my city work in construction. This is because the city is growing and there is still much empty space. I work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like my job.\n\nI like my home because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is a hard place for animals to live. We need to learn about the animals that live here so we can coexist peacefully. My family and I like the animals. My children are excited to see lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them.\n\nIf you visit my area, there are some things to see. Victorville is good for families who want to experience the desert. You can go to the San Bernardino County Fair. It is a fun event. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the mountains and ski. If you want to learn about the desert's history and culture, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has interesting objects and stories about the area.",
            "I am different from other people who live in a neighborhood. I do not live in a house with a family. Instead, I live in a college. My neighborhood is the people and the buildings on my college campus. My dorm is my home. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood.\n\nMy neighborhood has many buildings. Some are big and have many rooms. These are called apartments. Many students live in these buildings. Each building has about 20 people. Some buildings are small and have only a few rooms. These are not very common.\n\nThere are also houses that students can rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. But not many students live in these houses.\n\nMost students live in dorm rooms. These rooms are shared with one other person. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from many cultures and countries live here. The people who run the college, like professors and staff, live in the houses. Students live in the apartments and dorm rooms. We all come together to make a community.\n\nMy neighborhood has many stores. We have places to eat, buy food, and buy school clothes. We have everything we need right here.\n\nOur campus has a park. It is a safe and clean place for everyone to go. We take care of it together.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. I moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was sad at first because I missed my old home and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a new place with good housing and a good high school. \n\nIt took some time, but I got used to the new neighborhood. I made some new friends and some new enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are nice people and I consider them like family. I remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun and I was happy to be there. I caught a white strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but I did not catch the flowers.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I use a GPS to help me find my way. I like to explore and have fun with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games and enjoy life together. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I like to bring sticks and practice my balance, and I like to bring my wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. My dad taught me and my friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a lot of fun, but we were also very tired. The neighborhood has many good memories for me. I am glad I lived here and I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I like my neighborhood. It is near the college I attend. This is good for me because I can walk to class. The neighborhood has many apartment buildings. Some of these buildings are old, but they have been fixed up. There are a few restaurants and bars in the area. These places are fun to visit and not too expensive.\n\nOne of the bars recently changed its name. It is more expensive than the others. But the service and drinks are not bad. Most people in the neighborhood are nice. They are students or they have low incomes because the apartments are not very expensive.\n\nThere are many children in the area because there is a school nearby. I do not know my neighbors. But I do not want to know them. They smoke a lot of marijuana, and my landlord put a machine to freshen the air in front of their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny.\n\nThe buildings around me look old, but they have new things inside. Some people live in new buildings down the street. But I do not like them. I think they are poorly built, and the rent is too high. They are near the college, so the owners can charge a lot of money.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates, and most of the food is cooked in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard that it is a bad place to work.\n\nThe city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now the sidewalk is big and there is grass on the sides of the road. This makes the area look nicer. But my apartment building is covered in trees. Some of the trees were cut down, and there are stumps left. There are many more trees near my home than on the other street.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. But 43rd Street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look bad. There are many trees on this street, but they hide the way the buildings look. There is a lot of crime on this street. But I think my area is okay. I can afford it, and there are many useful things near my home. I like that the college is close, and there are two bus stops so I can go to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses on a circle street. The houses look like separate homes, but they are part of a larger building. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of our driveways some evenings and talk while the children play outside. It is a good feeling in this world with many machines and computers. It is like being in the past. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But we have a problem. There are storms with strong winds called tornadoes. This season, we have had warnings. Last night, we heard the sirens and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of big ice pieces falling from the sky. After the storm, the street was hot and the ice melted. It was very hot outside, but then it started to rain. I saw a beautiful color in the sky, like a big rainbow. I quickly took a picture with my camera. Then, people slowly came home from where they were. It was quiet again, and then it was like normal. Parents and children were outside, and dinner was cooking. I like my neighborhood. I recently moved from one state to another. I love the way people talk in this new place. I live in a two-bedroom apartment, like most of my neighbors. But some apartments are small. It doesn't make sense to me. I like to walk in the big field behind my home and go to the pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a good place to live, not too far from the city. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to enter eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to a boy who lives next door and another boy on my street. Neither of them lives there now, but I still think about the good times we had. Most of the people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. It has two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside when it is warm. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. People are friendly and do not bother you unless you need help. I have ordered packages online many times and never had them stolen. I trust my neighbors. A park is close to my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt there playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now, I go to the park to visit my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and reminds me of my childhood. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There are also fast food places and pizza shops. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. Some stores are different, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I see stories on social media and the news about people having problems with their neighbors, and I am grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns in the area. But it has a big job in the agriculture business. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town is proud of this title and has a sign that says so.\n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. There are many peach trees and cattle. Most of the houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer. Or they have gray shingles. The houses are far away from the road. They are near fields where people grow food for animals.\n\nIn the middle of the town, there is one traffic light. This is where the only stores are. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. But people often go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things and is busy all day.\n\nThere is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. The owner is kind and well-known in the community. She has been in business for a long time and delivers furniture to people's homes. Next to the furniture store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of dogs and other animals. There is a doctor's office and a vet's office in the town. They are small, but good at their jobs. There is an elementary school in the town. But when kids get a little older, they go to school in another town.\n\nThere is no park in the town, but they are building a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. The town is small, so there is not much to do. There is no movie theater, no bowling alley, and no place to walk your dog. But it is a nice town. You can drive through it quickly and not notice it's there.",
            "The first time I heard about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who went missing. It surprised me. Almost every apartment in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's because of the hard times. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. It is expensive, but we have learned to be careful with money. You start to like the smell of old toys from flea markets and old clothes that are not used. You smell less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just get used to things being like this. But flea markets always exist. The smell of adulthood is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in the leather even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three thrift stores near my home that I can walk to. If I start on one side, I can visit two stores that sell used things for charity, a library, a store that sells rare books, and a store that sells strange things. Downtown is crowded, with many cars and people. But it is quiet in the thrift stores. You cannot hear the noise of cars and people from inside. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more people and cars come to this area. It is a growing city, they say. It is home to a big company that sells things online and delivers them. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals, and nobody asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It is different from the South, where people care about each other. You do not ask questions about each other's lives here. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will be busy like the sea. It is a lively place to be. There is always something happening, like music from the pianist next door or singing from the people upstairs. We have less of an apartment with strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other when we need it, celebrate birthdays, and mourn when someone dies. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring mail to my neighbors, and they bring it to me. It is nice to see them, and I think they like my presence as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but it is my neighbors who make me feel like I did not completely ruin my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is very neat and clean. A homeowner's group helps keep everything looking good. You see many single-family homes with well-maintained lawns. Each lawn has small trees, grass, and pebbles. Every house has a two-car garage. The streets are in good condition. They are paved and smooth. You will not see any holes in the road. Most houses have one floor, but some have two. There are no mailboxes in front of each house. There is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. People use a key to get their mail. There are two large boxes for packages. We have a lot of space because our neighborhood is on the edge of the nearby city. It is like a mix of country and suburban areas. We have many things here. There are community swimming pools and walking paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can get exercise by walking around the neighborhood. Many people in our community are retired. It is a safe area. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young professionals living here. The city is big in population but feels small. It has many things you need. We have one big shopping center. It is not very big, but it has what you need. It takes 15 minutes to drive to any important place. After that, you can find many stores. Some stores sell healthy food, and others sell things at low prices. In general, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things here, like pools and walking paths. We can easily drive to any big store we want.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town near a big city. It is a town with a lower income area. My neighborhood is on the east side. The houses here are not expensive. Many people live here who have low incomes. However, the neighborhood is not ugly or unpleasant. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nThere is a little more crime here than in other areas of the town. There have been some violent crimes, like shootings and one murder. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting. But my family has not been hurt by crime. We have lost some things if we left them outside.\n\nThe town has a problem with the \"opioid epidemic.\" Many people have died from overdoses. But there are places to help people with addiction. We have programs to stop people from dying from overdoses.\n\nMy town has good and bad things. The elementary school is good. The teachers and staff are helpful. My son likes going to school. They have programs to make sure kids do not get bullied. All kids get free food at school. No one is treated unfairly because they do not have money.\n\nThe town's leaders have made the town look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But most of these changes happened in the center of town and where people shop. My neighborhood does not get as much attention. This is a problem for us.\n\nI like living in this town. People are kind. The schools are good. There are stores to buy what we need. Our house is not worth much money, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for a long time. I do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting place. It is built on a hill. The buildings in my neighborhood are old and important. I live in a big apartment building with seven stories. It is across the street from an old theater. A short walk away is a fun bar that is popular on warm nights. People of different kinds come to this bar. Many people want to go in, especially in June and July on weekends. A little further away is a big park. The park is good for the area. Around the park, there are steps and concrete walls. In cold weather, some people sleep in tents on the sidewalk and steps. They make their tents in a row. They do this to stay warm. It doesn't snow much here, but it rains a lot. The rain makes it hard to stay warm. They stay in the city because it is warmer and near a place where they can take a shower.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not just the old buildings that I like. What I like is the people. My neighborhood used to be a bad place with a lot of violence. People still talk about this. They talk about when the police and the DEA came to clean up the streets. The people remember. They still work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their town. They tell people not to walk around at night if they are white. I think this is not true. I think it is because of old ways of thinking. Maybe I am accepted here because I am not white. Or maybe the people here see that I understand their problems. I know that racism and unfair ideas are still a problem. This is true even in a place that is supposed to be welcoming to everyone. I like my neighborhood. I like the people. I feel alive when I am walking around at night. People are kind to me. They help me when I need it. This is a place where people are real.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in a rural area. You can see farms and small cities. There is no big store like Walmart or Target. You must drive to find what you need. But my home is in a beautiful place. I live near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you can find a place to swim.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some are old and some are new. Most houses have a basement. You can see the basement from the road. Many houses have old aluminum siding. The houses are all different colors. Most houses have yards. Some yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The houses look like they belong in America. People work hard to make a living. They raise families or have raised families. You can see kids playing outside. You can see people walking dogs, riding bikes, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who lives here and who does not. You can see people grilling outside and wave. You can see people walking their dogs and smile. The lawns are well taken care of. People do not leave leaves on the ground. The grass is short and neat. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nThis neighborhood is not very pretty, but it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful. It is safe. There are important places near our neighborhood. The police station and jail are nearby. The health department is close. We have a place where people take things they do not need to the garbage. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the people keeping score. You can hear the planes flying in and out of our small airport. You can walk to get ice cream. You can walk to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is a good place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My home is in a big city. The city is very different from one place to another. One place can be a home for people, and the next place can be a store or a restaurant. There are many stores and restaurants. Some stores are big and famous. Others are small and new. Some people like to visit these stores. Some stores are in big buildings called malls. Others are on the street. The streets are not always quiet. They are near homes where people live.\n\nThere are also parks in the city. People like to visit these parks with their children. My city is home to many different kinds of people. In one place, there are many people from the LGBTQ+ community. There are also many Jewish people. And there are people from the Soviet Union. The city is very big. There are many different communities in the city. Some of these communities are near my home. There are Korea town, China town, and Little Armenia. These are just a few of the many communities.\n\nBut the city is very big. It takes a long time to get from one place to another. People do not like to walk. The city has very bad traffic. It is hard to find a place to park. The city is building more and more homes. Some people like this. Others do not. They do not want more people in the city. They do not want more cars on the road.\n\nThere are many kinds of homes in the city. Some people live in big buildings. Others live in small houses. Some houses are for one family. Others are for two families. This is true in my neighborhood. There are many different kinds of homes. There are people of all ages in my neighborhood. I do not know most of my neighbors. We are not very close. But when I was a child, I played with my neighbors. We had fun together.",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family homes. But some have been divided into two, connected to each other. My home has a small front yard and a small driveway to the left. It looks like a home from a long time ago. This was the American dream. But now things are different. The dream is not as strong as it was. My neighborhood still looks nice. But the people are not as happy. The yards are not as clean. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside. The public school is old. It has been here for almost 90 years. It still looks good. It makes the children think about their future. It makes the older people remember the past. There are a few churches, but they are not very full. The basketball courts are always busy. All the houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. It is owned by a family from Yemen. They are the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most of the people are African American. The streets are wide and the children play football. They stop playing to let the cars pass. Many people in my neighborhood have lived here for a long time. They know each other's families. There used to be a karate school. But it closed when people stopped watching karate movies. Now it is a pharmacy. People think medicine can solve any problem. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies at a low price. The children do not like it. But the older people do. They think it is a good way to have fun. There is a highway that goes through our town. But it does not come into our town. We tried to get an entrance, but the older people did not want it. They said it would ruin our town. The town is building a new school. We are choosing a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good choice.",
            "You might not see it at first glance. This area is behind a shopping strip. It does not look like a place where people live. But if you go behind the old, empty store called Whole Foods, you can find a community. You have to walk behind the hotels that are empty most of the time.\n\nThese hotels are only used sometimes. They are for family reunions in the summer. There are many apartment buildings in this community. They are next to each other. They look like they were built to be together.\n\nThe first apartments you see have had bad things happen there. We will not talk about them too much. Appearances can be deceiving. But the other buildings are a different story. Almost nobody in this area knows about them.\n\nAcross from these buildings is a college. It is a small part of a bigger college. Students go there. They drink coffee and wake up early in the morning. The gates of the college open slowly to let them in. The students go to class. People driving by get angry because the students are holding up traffic.\n\nThe road goes into another street. There is a park on one side and a place where people go to get better after they break a bone. The people who run this place have nice chairs outside. They have a fan that moves the air around. Children play in the park. They spin around and fall down in the grass. Bees fly around the flowers by the road.\n\nOld people walk their dogs. They look at the teenagers on skateboards and the girls talking about boys and YouTube. There is a place to eat sushi nearby. It is cheap, but it is not busy. There is also a store to buy things for the pool. You can get a haircut and food at the same time. There is a place to buy frozen yogurt too. Teenagers eat frozen yogurt and do tricks on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a part of America. It is a small piece of history in a quiet part of the south. Nothing much changes here. Even time seems to stand still.",
            "She looked out at the corn fields. \"Where are we?\" she asked. I said, \"This is it!\" I knew she would be surprised to see so much open space. She was from a town where the grocery store was close to her house. She had never seen so much open land before. I told her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio. She finally understood where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a two-lane road. We passed a quarry with water. Then we came to a small development where I live. The houses are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard, and everyone takes care of them. In the spring, the yards have many flowers and trees. The driveways have nice cars like Mercedes-Benz. They shine in the sunlight after a car wash.\n\nI went to my house, a grey stucco house. My Korean neighbor was outside. He was happy to see me. He was always mowing his lawn and singing. People in the neighborhood liked him. He was a nice person with a special history. He was a doctor a long time ago. He is older now and not as funny. He uses a John Deere Zero Turn mower.\n\nMy house is near a stream. There are many geese and a Terrier. The stream goes into the quarry. You can hear the bullfrogs, the stream, and the cows from the nearby farms. Across the stream is a special place. It has trees, herbs, and wildflowers. I played there a lot as a child. I built forts and chased animals. I had friends to play with. The winters were very cold, but they were beautiful. The trees were bare, and it snowed sometimes. We made snowmen and snow angels. My sister and I played together, even though we fought sometimes. We built forts to keep our snowballs safe. We played pretend in our own little world.",
            "Portland, Oregon is a special place. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This means that people in Portland are not afraid to be different. They like things that are not normal. Portland was once a small, cheap city with its own unique culture. But now, many people from California are moving here, and the city is becoming more expensive. Still, Portland is weird in a good way. It means we accept things that others do not. We have all the modern things people want. We buy many things from China. But we also have a lot of things that are not modern. We have people who practice yoga, and people who like hipsters. We even have businesspeople. Maybe being weird just means we do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, the houses are colorful. The streets are lined with gardens full of flowers, herbs, and vegetables. In the summer, people put boxes on the street with things they no longer want. These boxes are called \"free boxes.\" They can have anything in them. Sometimes they have clothes and books. But they can have anything. Walking through my neighborhood is like a treasure hunt. You never know what you might find.\n\nPortland has many different kinds of people. Some people would never pick clothes out of a box on the street. They might go to yoga with goats or watch the city soccer team play. Portland is full of people who love many things. We are also full of people who want to achieve their dreams. But some people have mental health problems that make them turn to drugs. The rain and gray skies in Portland do not help. We also have a problem with homelessness. Many people come to Portland because we have good social services. But we do not have enough services to help everyone. The people who live here are not sure what to do about it. We are not weird when it comes to this problem.",
            "The mountains are always there. They stand in the north, watching the sun rise and set every day. I often forget they are there, but they do not change. They stand strong and still, no matter what happens in my life. When I am stressed and worried, the mountains call to me. When I look at them, I feel a little better. They give me strength to go on. \n\nI first saw the mountains when I started college. They are near the university where I study. The college has many beautiful buildings and a nice pond. But the mountains are special to me. They have a special place in my heart.\n\nThe rest of the town is also nice. There are many cafes where I study and drink coffee. I can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is an old part of town with old buildings. It is a fun place to be. But then I can walk to the library and be in a quiet place.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. One is busy and exciting. The other is quiet and peaceful. This makes the town interesting. I have many happy memories of my time here. I walk with my friends in the park or go to a movie in the college theater. But I also have sad memories. I have cried by the pond in the middle of the night when I was feeling unhappy.\n\nI like to walk by the pond and look at the turtles and ducks. They live their lives and do their jobs. This makes me think about my own life and what I want to do. I wonder if I have a purpose. I walk to the main street and look at the mountains. They are always there. They are strong and still. They make me feel strong and able to go on.",
            "If you plan to visit Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you will not have a hard time finding it. The neighborhood is easy to reach by public transportation. It is one of the most popular ways to get around in New York City. Bensonhurst is a busy area with many Asian stores. This is because many Asian people have moved to the area in the last twenty years. You will see an Asian store on almost every block as you walk. These stores often sell food and do laundry. People like these stores because the food is good, the prices are low, and they are convenient. There are several Asian stores near where I live. In fact, I can walk to four stores in just a few minutes. This makes it easy to buy groceries. Bensonhurst is not all Asian people. It is a diverse area with people from different countries and their families. Many big stores in the area are owned by Asian people. There is also a park nearby with a basketball court, a field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, a playground for kids, and a water fountain for kids to play in during the summer. The park is also a place where people from different backgrounds can play together. In Bensonhurst, you will not see many big buildings for companies. Most buildings are apartments for people who own them together, or houses. Many people live in two-family houses. The people in this area are generally nice, but they can be loud. Every day, you will hear loud music from cars driving by or people speeding. If you visit at night, be careful. While Bensonhurst is safe, you might meet people who want to cause trouble. I have had some problems with people in the past, but it was a long time ago. There is also a problem with people stealing packages. This is a common problem in many areas. Another problem is that people do not follow the rules about cleaning up after their dogs. Every morning, you will see dog waste on the sidewalk as you walk to the train or the store. My biggest complaint is the dog waste on the sidewalks everywhere I go. Be careful and keep your shoes clean.",
            "I do not live on a street with many sidewalks. My house is at the top of the biggest hill in my neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because many people like to run up it. There is no sidewalk on my street. So, everyone walks on the road. The road is not in good condition. In some places, it is pitted. This can be a problem for drivers. The telephone and electric wires around the block look old. They are often damaged in storms. We get many storms and rainfalls in my area. This causes branches to fall on the power lines. The repairs make the lines look old and broken.\n\nThere are many tall trees here. But people do not like them. They want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are high up on the hill. They have big windows on the top floor to see the ocean.\n\nThe view is beautiful at sunset. The water in the bay looks nice. The sky turns orange. But it is often cloudy. This makes the sunlight weak. Most days are overcast and damp.\n\nMoss grows on everything here, including roofs, cars, and fences. I left my car outside for a month. It got moss and looked funny. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school nearby. Most people are older and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs run around the neighborhood. They like to jump into yards or run in the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might get in. I once found a dog in my house. I had to chase it out.\n\nRabbits are common in my neighborhood. They are big and like to dig up plants and burrow into yards. My cats like to chase them. They have made most of the rabbits leave.\n\nWe have many birds here, like small sparrows and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle comes by, but the crows chase it away. There are no stores near my house. But if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The bay is not very wide. You can see the other side even through the mist.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My home is in a quiet neighborhood. It's a street between two big roads, so we see some cars all the time. But it's not too busy. Many people in the neighborhood are friendly. They take care of their yards. In the winter, we like to sled down a hill near our house. Our home is at the corner of the street, so we see everyone who comes and goes. When we see a strange car, we take notice.\n\nSome neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and play. We like to go outside and play, even when it's raining. We have a big deck where we grill food. It smells good when we cook outside. We hear lawn mowers a lot from March to October. Our neighborhood was once a forest, so there are many trees and shade. We have to clean up leaves in the fall. It's a lot of work, but the smell of burning leaves is nice.\n\nWe don't have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is at the back of the house. We don't use the front door much. I like to work in the garage on my truck. When the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it's quiet. But sometimes we see many cars because family members visit from other places. I like living here. If the street weren't a main road, it would be perfect.",
            "My home is in the middle of the desert. It is a dry and brown place. People who live here are used to seeing so much dirt. If you don't live here, you might not understand this. When I lived here in the nineteen nineties, there were not many houses. Now there are more. The area is changing like many places. People here are usually friendly. But, like in any city, there are good and bad things. I live near old people who are kind. My neighborhood is nice.\n\nThere are not many stores in my area. Most are big chains. You can buy food at places like Food for Less or Smart. If you want to buy healthy food, you have to go somewhere else. Most people in my city work in construction. This is because the city is growing and there is still much empty space. I work in construction. I install drywall and T-bars. I like my job.\n\nI like my home because of the animals. People come to the desert for its beauty. The desert is a hard place for animals to live. We need to learn about the animals that live here so we can coexist peacefully. My family and I like the animals. My children are excited to see lizards and desert bugs. They are outside right now trying to catch them.\n\nIf you visit my area, there are some things to see. Victorville is good for families who want to experience the desert. You can go to the San Bernardino County Fair. It is a fun event. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the mountains and ski. If you want to learn about the desert's history and culture, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has interesting objects and stories about the area.",
            "I am different from other people who live in a neighborhood. I do not live in a house with a family. Instead, I live in a college. My neighborhood is the people and the buildings on my college campus. My dorm is my home. I also think of the campus as my neighborhood.\n\nMy neighborhood has many buildings. Some are big and have many rooms. These are called apartments. Many students live in these buildings. Each building has about 20 people. Some buildings are small and have only a few rooms. These are not very common.\n\nThere are also houses that students can rent. These houses have 2-4 bedrooms. But not many students live in these houses.\n\nMost students live in dorm rooms. These rooms are shared with one other person. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. People from many cultures and countries live here. The people who run the college, like professors and staff, live in the houses. Students live in the apartments and dorm rooms. We all come together to make a community.\n\nMy neighborhood has many stores. We have places to eat, buy food, and buy school clothes. We have everything we need right here.\n\nOur campus has a park. It is a safe and clean place for everyone to go. We take care of it together.",
            "I have lived in this neighborhood for about 10 years. I moved here from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I was sad at first because I missed my old home and friends. But my parents wanted the best for me and my sister, so we moved to a new place with good housing and a good high school. \n\nIt took some time, but I got used to the new neighborhood. I made some new friends and some new enemies at school. I did not really know my neighbors very well, except for Mr. Glen and his children. They are nice people and I consider them like family. I remember Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun and I was happy to be there. I caught a white strap from Ms. Veda's leg, but I did not catch the flowers.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze, but I use a GPS to help me find my way. I like to explore and have fun with my friends Kason and Curtis. We used to play video games and enjoy life together. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I like to bring sticks and practice my balance, and I like to bring my wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. My dad taught me and my friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a lot of fun, but we were also very tired. The neighborhood has many good memories for me. I am glad I lived here and I am excited to see what the future holds.",
            "I like my neighborhood. It is near the college I attend. This is good for me because I can walk to class. The neighborhood has many apartment buildings. Some of these buildings are old, but they have been fixed up. There are a few restaurants and bars in the area. These places are fun to visit and not too expensive.\n\nOne of the bars recently changed its name. It is more expensive than the others. But the service and drinks are not bad. Most people in the neighborhood are nice. They are students or they have low incomes because the apartments are not very expensive.\n\nThere are many children in the area because there is a school nearby. I do not know my neighbors. But I do not want to know them. They smoke a lot of marijuana, and my landlord put a machine to freshen the air in front of their door. My boyfriend and I think this is funny.\n\nThe buildings around me look old, but they have new things inside. Some people live in new buildings down the street. But I do not like them. I think they are poorly built, and the rent is too high. They are near the college, so the owners can charge a lot of money.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my home. They serve food on paper plates, and most of the food is cooked in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard that it is a bad place to work.\n\nThe city fixed the road near my home last summer. Now the sidewalk is big and there is grass on the sides of the road. This makes the area look nicer. But my apartment building is covered in trees. Some of the trees were cut down, and there are stumps left. There are many more trees near my home than on the other street.\n\nBehind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street. But 43rd Street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look bad. There are many trees on this street, but they hide the way the buildings look. There is a lot of crime on this street. But I think my area is okay. I can afford it, and there are many useful things near my home. I like that the college is close, and there are two bus stops so I can go to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My neighborhood is a group of houses on a circle street. The houses look like separate homes, but they are part of a larger building. They are all painted yellow with white porches and green roofs. Most people in the neighborhood are friends with each other. We stand at the end of our driveways some evenings and talk while the children play outside. It is a good feeling in this world with many machines and computers. It is like being in the past. We are near fields and trees with blue skies and white clouds. But we have a problem. There are storms with strong winds called tornadoes. This season, we have had warnings. Last night, we heard the sirens and went to a safe place. I was in my bathtub with my little dog and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was quiet, except for the sound of big ice pieces falling from the sky. After the storm, the street was hot and the ice melted. It was very hot outside, but then it started to rain. I saw a beautiful color in the sky, like a big rainbow. I quickly took a picture with my camera. Then, people slowly came home from where they were. It was quiet again, and then it was like normal. Parents and children were outside, and dinner was cooking. I like my neighborhood. I recently moved from one state to another. I love the way people talk in this new place. I live in a two-bedroom apartment, like most of my neighbors. But some apartments are small. It doesn't make sense to me. I like to walk in the big field behind my home and go to the pond. I see deer and hear a big frog singing in the morning. It is a good place to live, not too far from the city. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the nearby farms. It is like living in a small village. We even have a donkey that brays in the evening. I was lucky to find this nice neighborhood.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to enter eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to a boy who lives next door and another boy on my street. Neither of them lives there now, but I still think about the good times we had. Most of the people who lived here when I moved in are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. It has two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside when it is warm. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone in the neighborhood. People are friendly and do not bother you unless you need help. I have ordered packages online many times and never had them stolen. I trust my neighbors. A park is close to my house. I have good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with my friends. I also got hurt there playing football, but the good memories are more important. Now, I go to the park to visit my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me feel happy and reminds me of my childhood. My neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food nearby. There are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants within a short walk. Many people order food from apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. There are also fast food places and pizza shops. The stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. Some stores are different, like an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. I see stories on social media and the news about people having problems with their neighbors, and I am grateful for mine.",
            "My neighborhood is a small town in South Carolina. It is not very different from other towns in the area. But it has a big job in the agriculture business. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World. The town is proud of this title and has a sign that says so.\n\nThe town has a lot of farmland. There are many peach trees and cattle. Most of the houses are two stories high. They have metal roofs to keep cool in the hot summer. Or they have gray shingles. The houses are far away from the road. They are near fields where people grow food for animals.\n\nIn the middle of the town, there is one traffic light. This is where the only stores are. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong, a Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They sell Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. But people often go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food. The most popular store in town is Dollar General. It sells many things and is busy all day.\n\nThere is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. The owner is kind and well-known in the community. She has been in business for a long time and delivers furniture to people's homes. Next to the furniture store is a place to take care of pets called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They take care of dogs and other animals. There is a doctor's office and a vet's office in the town. They are small, but good at their jobs. There is an elementary school in the town. But when kids get a little older, they go to school in another town.\n\nThere is no park in the town, but they are building a new place for people to play. It will be 2.5 acres big. The town is small, so there is not much to do. There is no movie theater, no bowling alley, and no place to walk your dog. But it is a nice town. You can drive through it quickly and not notice it's there.",
            "The first time I heard about my neighborhood, I was listening to a podcast about people who went missing. It surprised me. Almost every apartment in the area cost over one thousand dollars a month. I had never heard this story before, and neither had my friends. Maybe it's because of the hard times. I know some of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. It is expensive, but we have learned to be careful with money. You start to like the smell of old toys from flea markets and old clothes that are not used. You smell less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just get used to things being like this. But flea markets always exist. The smell of adulthood is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in the leather even after you wash it.\n\nThere are three thrift stores near my home that I can walk to. If I start on one side, I can visit two stores that sell used things for charity, a library, a store that sells rare books, and a store that sells strange things. Downtown is crowded, with many cars and people. But it is quiet in the thrift stores. You cannot hear the noise of cars and people from inside. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Every year, more people and cars come to this area. It is a growing city, they say. It is home to a big company that sells things online and delivers them. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy with their own goals, and nobody asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It is different from the South, where people care about each other. You do not ask questions about each other's lives here. You can keep to yourself as long as you like, and the city will be busy like the sea. It is a lively place to be. There is always something happening, like music from the pianist next door or singing from the people upstairs. We have less of an apartment with strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other when we need it, celebrate birthdays, and mourn when someone dies. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I try to keep my apartment clean and leave food for them, and they do the same for me. I bring mail to my neighbors, and they bring it to me. It is nice to see them, and I think they like my presence as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern city, but it is my neighbors who make me feel like I did not completely ruin my life.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is very neat and clean. A homeowner's group helps keep everything looking good. You see many single-family homes with well-maintained lawns. Each lawn has small trees, grass, and pebbles. Every house has a two-car garage. The streets are in good condition. They are paved and smooth. You will not see any holes in the road. Most houses have one floor, but some have two. There are no mailboxes in front of each house. There is a group of mailboxes at the end of the street. People use a key to get their mail. There are two large boxes for packages. We have a lot of space because our neighborhood is on the edge of the nearby city. It is like a mix of country and suburban areas. We have many things here. There are community swimming pools and walking paths where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can get exercise by walking around the neighborhood. Many people in our community are retired. It is a safe area. People look out for each other. We also have some middle-aged and young professionals living here. The city is big in population but feels small. It has many things you need. We have one big shopping center. It is not very big, but it has what you need. It takes 15 minutes to drive to any important place. After that, you can find many stores. Some stores sell healthy food, and others sell things at low prices. In general, my neighborhood is safe and nice. We have many good things here, like pools and walking paths. We can easily drive to any big store we want.",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town near a big city. It is a town with a lower income area. My neighborhood is on the east side. The houses here are not expensive. Many people live here who have low incomes. However, the neighborhood is not ugly or unpleasant. My neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk by.\n\nThere is a little more crime here than in other areas of the town. There have been some violent crimes, like shootings and one murder. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting. But my family has not been hurt by crime. We have lost some things if we left them outside.\n\nThe town has a problem with the \"opioid epidemic.\" Many people have died from overdoses. But there are places to help people with addiction. We have programs to stop people from dying from overdoses.\n\nMy town has good and bad things. The elementary school is good. The teachers and staff are helpful. My son likes going to school. They have programs to make sure kids do not get bullied. All kids get free food at school. No one is treated unfairly because they do not have money.\n\nThe town's leaders have made the town look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But most of these changes happened in the center of town and where people shop. My neighborhood does not get as much attention. This is a problem for us.\n\nI like living in this town. People are kind. The schools are good. There are stores to buy what we need. Our house is not worth much money, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for a long time. I do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is an interesting place. It is built on a hill. The buildings in my neighborhood are old and important. I live in a big apartment building with seven stories. It is across the street from an old theater. A short walk away is a fun bar that is popular on warm nights. People of different kinds come to this bar. Many people want to go in, especially in June and July on weekends. A little further away is a big park. The park is good for the area. Around the park, there are steps and concrete walls. In cold weather, some people sleep in tents on the sidewalk and steps. They make their tents in a row. They do this to stay warm. It doesn't snow much here, but it rains a lot. The rain makes it hard to stay warm. They stay in the city because it is warmer and near a place where they can take a shower.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is not just the old buildings that I like. What I like is the people. My neighborhood used to be a bad place with a lot of violence. People still talk about this. They talk about when the police and the DEA came to clean up the streets. The people remember. They still work hard to keep the neighborhood clean. They care about what happens in their town. They tell people not to walk around at night if they are white. I think this is not true. I think it is because of old ways of thinking. Maybe I am accepted here because I am not white. Or maybe the people here see that I understand their problems. I know that racism and unfair ideas are still a problem. This is true even in a place that is supposed to be welcoming to everyone. I like my neighborhood. I like the people. I feel alive when I am walking around at night. People are kind to me. They help me when I need it. This is a place where people are real.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in a rural area. You can see farms and small cities. There is no big store like Walmart or Target. You must drive to find what you need. But my home is in a beautiful place. I live near two big lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. Everywhere you go, you can find a place to swim.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. The houses are not close together. They are not the same. Some are old and some are new. Most houses have a basement. You can see the basement from the road. Many houses have old aluminum siding. The houses are all different colors. Most houses have yards. Some yards have trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens and fences for their animals. The houses look like they belong in America. People work hard to make a living. They raise families or have raised families. You can see kids playing outside. You can see people walking dogs, riding bikes, and rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. You can tell who lives here and who does not. You can see people grilling outside and wave. You can see people walking their dogs and smile. The lawns are well taken care of. People do not leave leaves on the ground. The grass is short and neat. People take care of their plants and bushes.\n\nThis neighborhood is not very pretty, but it is a good place to live. It is quiet and peaceful. It is safe. There are important places near our neighborhood. The police station and jail are nearby. The health department is close. We have a place where people take things they do not need to the garbage. We have baseball and softball fields nearby. You can hear the people keeping score. You can hear the planes flying in and out of our small airport. You can walk to get ice cream. You can walk to the park. My kids can ride their bikes to the park. It is a good place to live."
