            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Bensonhurt is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. If you visit, you will not have trouble finding it. The public transportation is good. Many people use it. Bensonhurt is a busy place. You will still feel like you are in New York City. When you walk around, you will see many Asian stores. Many people from Asia live here. Over the past twenty years, the number of Asian people in Bensonhurt has increased. As a result, you will see one Asian store every few blocks. Many people like the Asian stores because they are good, cheap, and convenient. I live nearby. There are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This makes it easy to buy food.\n\nBensonhurt is not just Asian people. It is a mix of people from many countries. Immigrants and their children live here. Most of the big businesses are owned by Asians. There is also a park nearby. It has many things for people to do. There are basketball courts, a big field, handball courts, and a playground for children. In the summer, children can play with water.\n\nThe buildings in Bensonhurt are not very tall. Most people live in small houses or apartments. The people here are nice, but it can be noisy. You will hear cars with loud music and people driving fast. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurt is usually safe, but some people can be mean. I was once hurt here, but it was a long time ago. Recently, some people stole packages from houses. People also do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the ground every morning. Keep your shoes clean when you walk around.",
            "I live in a place where there are few sidewalks. A big hill is near my house. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many people like to run up it. The road I live on is not good for driving. There are many holes in it. Everyone walks on the road because there are no sidewalks. The telephone and electric wires around our block are old and broken. It rains a lot where I live. The wind and rain break the wires and cause problems. We have to repair them often.\n\nThere are many big trees in my area. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to look at the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset when the water is lit from below and the sky is orange. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on many things: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car alone for a month, and when I got back, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near my house. But most people in my area are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs like to run in people's yards or down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nWe also have rabbits in our area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see many birds: small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles fly by. The neighborhood crows chase them away. We do not have stores nearby, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The bay is not very wide, but you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a typical neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. The town is between two state highways. We have some traffic on our street, but it is mostly quiet. Few people move in and out of the neighborhood, so I know most of the people who live here. They like to take care of their lawns and do other daily tasks. In the winter, we sled down a hill on the side street. Our house is at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going. We pay attention to any strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and play. We are home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us: my wife and two daughters (eleven and fourteen years old). So, everyone is used to us coming and going. We go outside and play, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck and it smells nice. We can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. We have many trees, so it is shady. We have to rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. It is a sign that fall has arrived. We do not have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. I like to work in my garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. It is quiet on holidays. Thanksgiving and other holidays have extra cars because people visit from out of town. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the high desert. It is a very dry place with much dirt. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like to see brown everywhere. When I first moved here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now, there are many more houses. My neighborhood is becoming more like a city. But this is true of many places.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are friendly. However, like many cities, it has good and bad parts. I live near many older people. They are kind. In my neighborhood, there are many stores with chains, such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want organic food, you must go to a different place. \n\nThe main jobs in my city are in construction. This is because my city is still growing and there is much space to build. I am worried about this. I do not want my city to change too much. I came from a big city and do not want to go back.\n\nMy job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bar. What I like about my home is the animals. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has many plants and animals that need protecting. It is good to learn about these animals so we can live together safely. My family and I like the animals. My three children like to catch lizards and bugs.\n\nWe have some fun things to do in my city. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. You can see the snow-covered mountains and take lessons to learn how to ski. If you like history and nature, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many things to show you about the desert and the people who live here.",
            "I live in a special kind of neighborhood. It is not like other neighborhoods. I live on a college campus. My dormitory is my community. I also consider the campus around me my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses where I live. First, there are apartments. Each apartment has four rooms. Twenty people live in each building. Second, there are houses that people rent. These houses have two or four bedrooms. Not many people live in these houses. Finally, there are rooms in the dormitory where two people live. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nPeople from many countries and ages live in my neighborhood. The school is proud of its diversity. Most of the staff live in the houses. New students live in the dormitory. Older students live in the apartments.\n\nLet's talk about the stores. My school is a closed community. It has many stores. There are places to buy food, clothes and other things. All the things people need are in the neighborhood.\n\nThere is a park in my neighborhood. It is a good place for people to play. The park is clean and safe. All the people in my neighborhood help keep it that way.",
            "I live in my neighborhood for 10 years. I was sad when I first moved here. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and friends. But my mom and dad said this was a better place for us. We have a good house and a good school. It was not a bad neighborhood.\n\nOver time, I got used to it. I made some new friends. I also made some enemies in school. I did not know my neighbors very well. But Mr. Glen and his family were nice. They lived next to us. I also knew Dennis a little bit.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I danced with his daughter, Marsharii. I hope she is doing well. My mom and dad and my sister also went to the wedding. We all had a good time.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. But I have a GPS now. I can explore it more. I like to play video games with my friends Kason and Curtis. We have fun together. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm.\n\nI like to practice my balance with sticks. I also like to play with my bokken wooden sword. There are a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. They made us practice hard. But we had fun.\n\nI have had some good times in this neighborhood. I have a lot of memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. This is good for me. I like it. There are many apartment buildings in my neighborhood. Some restaurants and bars are also near me. These places are fun to visit and not very expensive. One of the bars was recently renamed. It costs more money to go there, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people in my neighborhood are nice. They are either college students or they do not have a lot of money. The apartments are not very expensive. There is a school near me for young children. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My landlord put a machine in their apartment to make the air smell good. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It feels insulting. The buildings around me are old and may need repair. A little ways down the street are new apartments. I do not like them. They are not well built, but the rent is high. I think this is unfair. They are close to the college, so the landlords can charge a lot of money. There is a cheap restaurant near me that serves food on paper plates. Most of the food is heated in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is a bad place to work. The city gave some money to fix the road near my apartment. Now the sidewalk is big and nice, and there are many trees and grass. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. Some of these trees were cut down, but there are many still left. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street. The street behind me is 43rd street. This street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they may be hiding the condition of the buildings. Many crimes have happened at an apartment complex on this street. But I do not blame them. There are also apartments across from me with problems. But I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many useful things near me. I like being close to the university and the two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses on a special street. The houses are close to each other and look like small towns. They have yellow paint and white porches. Almost everyone knows each other. We often stand at the end of our driveways and talk to each other. Our children play together outside. It is a nice change from the busy world. It feels like the past. We live near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and fluffy. But sometimes we have problems with big storms. This season, we had many warnings for tornadoes. One night, we even heard sirens. We went to a safe place in our house. My little dog was with me. My big dog stayed outside and barked. The storm brought big hail. After the storm, the road was hot and wet. We went from hot to cool in a short time. The hail melted on the hot road. As the sun came out, it started to rain. We saw a beautiful rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. We stayed inside for a little while. Then, people started coming home. Life went back to normal. We cooked dinner and talked outside. I like this neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a small apartment with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. But each apartment is different inside. Some are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond, but it is not for swimming. I have seen deer and birds. In the morning, I hear a big frog singing. It is a nice place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to a boy who lives two houses down from me and another boy who lives on my street. They are not there anymore, but the memories are still with me. Many of the people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. The neighborhood has many two-story houses. When the weather is warm, I hear kids playing outside every weekend. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I never have problems with my neighbors. If I need help, they will help me. I have ordered packages online many times and never lost one. I trust my neighbors. There is a park just a minute from my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the other boys in the neighborhood. I also have a bad memory there - I got hit in the nose playing football. But the good memories are more than the bad. Now, I go to the park to play with my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time because it reminds me of my neighborhood.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food near my house. In a short walk, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Most people order food online now. There are many fast food places near my house. There are also many stores near my house. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. There is even an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I read about problems with neighbors on social media, I am happy to have good neighbors like mine.",
            "My town is a small place in South Carolina. It is like other towns in the area. But it is important for farmers. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town says on its sign. Many farms have peach trees or cattle. Houses are far apart. They are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles to keep out the sun. Most houses are not near the road. They are set back so people can use the land for animals and crops. In the main part of town, there is a traffic light. This is where people can buy food. There are three places to get fast food. They are Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. A pizza place used to be there, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town, but people usually go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food. Many people like to go to Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in town for a long time and has people who will deliver your furniture. Next to the furniture store is a place to groom pets. They can take care of your pet while you are away. There is a doctor and a veterinarian in town, but they are not very big. There is a small school called Johnston Elementary. Students go to school there until they are in fifth grade. Then they go to school in another town. There are no parks in town, but they are building a small park. It will be 2.5 acres and people can go there to have fun. There are not many things to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice town.",
            "I heard a story about my place on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. My apartment costs more than a thousand dollars a month. I had not heard this story before. Neither had my friends. Perhaps it is the struggle. Some of my friends are sad every night. Life is expensive. But we know how to save money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. We like the smell of old magazines. It stays on old furniture even after we clean it. There are three second-hand stores near my home. I can walk there. I can visit two stores that help people, a place to borrow books, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are busy. Cars and people move every morning. But the stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Many people visit every year. The city is growing. A big company is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy. People do not ask for help. I can be alone and quiet. People do not bother me. It is not like the South. People care about each other in the South. Here, people do not ask about each other's lives. I can be myself. The city is lively. I hear music next door and people singing upstairs. We are not just strangers. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. We help each other when we need it. I am lucky to live here. I like my neighbors. They are kind to me. I clean after myself. They do the same. We share food and mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern building. But my neighbors make me feel at home.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is part of a community with a homeowner's association. This means everything looks the same. The houses are well-maintained and single-family homes. They have small yards with grass, some pebbles, and short driveways. Some houses are one-story, but some are two-story. \n\nThe streets are always in good shape. You will not see potholes or broken roads. We have many families living here, but everyone takes care of their homes. You will not see individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get to your mailbox. There are also big lockers for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. We have a lot of land, which is good for many things. There are community pools that everyone can use. They are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking trails where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can run around the neighborhood to get exercise.\n\nMost people who live here are old, but we also have some middle-aged and young people. It is a safe area, and people take care of each other. We have a small city nearby. It is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need, like a shopping mall. It is not very big, but it has everything we need. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to the mall. There are many stores to choose from. We have good food stores and cheap stores. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and trails. It is easy to get to the city and all its stores.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city but not in it. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. Many people in this area have low incomes. They rent or own homes here. The houses are not expensive. The neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates are higher here than in other parts of the town. There have been some violent crimes near my home. For example, there were shootings and one person died. But we have not been hurt. Sometimes things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. I am lucky my family has not been hurt by crime.\n\nThe town I live in has a big problem. Many people here have died from taking too much of a strong drug called fentanyl. There are places in town to help people with addiction. They have centers to help people get better and teach others how to help too. We have a lot of good things in our town. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and workers are kind. My son has special needs, but he is happy and safe at school. The school has a group that helps parents and makes events to get families involved. They give free food to all students. No one goes hungry because they cannot pay. The town council is working to make our town look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But they have mainly done this in the center of town and on the other side where there are stores. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have everything we need. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is located on a hill. Many famous buildings are here. I live in a 7-story building near a historic theater. A short walk away is a small bar where people like to go in the summer. It is very popular. Some people wait in line to get in. Near my house is a big park. It is nice for people who live in the city. The park is fenced in and has many stairs. In the winter, some people who do not have a home sleep here. They set up tents and stay together for safety and warmth. This is better than sleeping alone.\n\nI like my city. It is not just the old buildings that are special. The people are also special. This neighborhood was once very bad. There were many gangs and violence. But the people here work hard to keep it safe. They take care of their city. They remember the past, but they are not afraid. They want people to know they are kind and caring.\n\nSome people say it is not safe to walk around at night. But I think this is not true. The people here are friendly. They are kind to me. They help me when I need it. I feel safe walking around at night. I like it here. No matter where I go, this will always be my home. The people here are like a family to me. They make me feel welcome and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a country place. People live in houses on the land. They have big yards. Most houses are old. Some are new. They are not the same. They are different. Many houses have basements. You can see them from the street. They have old aluminum siding. The houses are different colors. Some people have animals. They have yards with swings and playsets. The town is like America. People work to make money. They have families. On the street, you see children playing. You see people walking dogs and riding bikes. People know their neighbors. They are friendly. They say hello. The lawns are nice. The grass is cut. The flowers are trimmed. It is a quiet and safe place. People want to live here. It is near the police station and the hospital. People can recycle here. There is a park where children play sports. There are baseball and softball fields. You can also hear airplanes flying in and out of the small airport. You can walk to get ice cream or go to the store. My children can ride their bikes to the park. It is a nice place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood is interesting. It has single family houses. But some homes are divided into two parts, while still connected. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the side. It is like the other houses. They look like they are from a long time ago. Back then, living in the suburbs was a popular choice for Americans. But now it is not as popular. My neighborhood still looks nice. It reminds people that the idea of a perfect life is still possible. The people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not well taken care of. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside as if nothing is wrong. The public school has been there for almost 90 years. It still looks strong. The churches are few and are not used much. But the basketball courts are still popular. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called \"A\" Supermarket. It is owned by a family from Yemen. They are probably the only family from Yemen in the neighborhood. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Children play football until cars come by. Most people have lived here for a long time. They know everyone. There was a karate school, but it closed when kids stopped wanting to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Most people do not like it because it does not have new movies. But older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is a highway that goes through our town, but it only goes through the town next to us. Some people wanted to make an exit in our town, but others did not. They thought it would ruin the town.

But if you go behind the old, abandoned store and walk back behind the hotels, you will find a busy community. There are many apartment buildings here. They are next to each other like a series of small boxes.\n\nSome of these buildings have problems. We will not talk about those. But the other buildings are very different. They are near a small college. The college has a quiet campus where students go to learn. They often go there early in the morning with coffee in their hands.\n\nThe college is near a road. The road meets another road with a park on one side. There is a building where people go to get help when they are hurt. The building has a nice porch and a fan that makes the air feel cool.\n\nChildren play in the park. They run and jump on the grass. There are flowers near the road, and bees are flying around them. Old people walk their dogs on a path in the park. They see the young people on skateboards and the girls talking by the swings. There is a store near the park where you can buy cheap food. There is also a store where you can buy things for your pool. You can even get a manicure and eat while you are there. There is a store with frozen yogurt too. The young people like to buy yogurt and eat it while they are on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a special place. It is a part of American life. It is a place where people live and do things. It is a place that does not change much.",
            "We drove past many corn fields. They went on forever. My friend was surprised by the empty space. She lived in a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home. She had never seen so much open space before. I told her what it was like growing up in a small town in Ohio. After that, she understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a two-lane road. There was a big hole in the ground filled with water. Just past it was where I live. My home is in a small group of houses. They are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a lot of land, over half an acre. Everyone takes care of their yard. In the spring, people plant flowers. The trees change with the seasons. The driveways have big, luxury cars. They shine in the sun after they are washed. My neighbor was mowing his lawn. He was singing a happy song. My friend and I laughed. He is a kind person with an interesting past. He used to be a doctor. He is older now and a little slower. He still mows his lawn every day.\n\nAs we kept driving, we reached my house. There were many geese in the yard. Our dog was chasing them. Behind the house, there was a small stream. The sound of the stream and the frogs was loud. Sometimes we could hear cows from the farms nearby. Across a small bridge made of wood, there was a quiet place. There were many trees, herbs, and wildflowers. That was where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and chased animals. I had friends in the neighborhood. In the winter, the town could be very cold. But it was also very beautiful. The trees were empty and the flowers were gone. Sometimes it snowed and a winter wonderland appeared. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot when we were kids. But in the winter, we just played and had fun.",
            "Portland, Oregon is an interesting city. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This means that people in Portland like to do things their own way. They like to be different. Some people remember the city as it was in the 1990s and early 2000s. It was less well-known and less expensive. The city had many creative and unique cultures.\n\nToday, many people from California are moving to Portland. They are building new homes and businesses. But Portland is still weird. Weird means accepting of things that are not normal. People in Portland do not always judge others for being different. They have yoga and hipsters and business people like other cities. But in Portland, they just do not take things as seriously.\n\nMy neighborhood is colorful. There are beautiful homes, gardens with flowers and herbs, and free boxes on the sidewalk in the summer. Free boxes are boxes with things that people are giving away. They can have clothes, books, or anything else. Walking through my neighborhood is fun. You might find something interesting.\n\nPortland is full of people who love many things. Some people go to goat yoga. Others like to watch the city's soccer team. Portland has a drug problem. It is caused by mental health issues. The rain and cloudy weather may also be a problem. The city also has a homelessness problem. Many people come to Portland because it has good social services. But the services are not enough.\n\nPeople in Portland are not strange about this problem. They are confused. They do not know what to do. Some people care about the homeless, but others do not. This is like other cities in the United States.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They watch the sun every day. The sun rises and sets in front of them. The mountains do not change. They are steady and strong. They do not care about our problems. But when we are sad or stressed, they call to us. We look at them and feel better. They give us strength to keep going.\n\nI first saw the mountains when I was in college. They are near the university. The campus is nice, but the mountains are special. There are many beautiful things on campus, like buildings and ponds and trees. But the mountains are the most beautiful. The rest of the town is nice too. There are many coffee shops where I studied for long time. You can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and interesting. The buildings are old and colorful.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. It is busy and fun in the downtown area. But you can also be quiet and peaceful in the small town. The library is a quiet place. You can go there to think and relax. This town has a special feeling. It invites you to explore it. I made many happy memories in this town. I walked with my friends through the park at night. We went to the movie theater and watched a movie. But I also made sad memories. We all make memories, both good and bad. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I have cried there many times.\n\nI walked near the pond and the park and the houses. I saw the sun shining on the palm trees. The sky was beautiful. I looked up and saw the mountains. They were strong and steady. They reminded me to be strong too. They told me to keep going.",
            "Bensonhurt is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. If you visit, you will not have trouble finding it. The public transportation is good. Many people use it. Bensonhurt is a busy place. You will still feel like you are in New York City. When you walk around, you will see many Asian stores. Many people from Asia live here. Over the past twenty years, the number of Asian people in Bensonhurt has increased. As a result, you will see one Asian store every few blocks. Many people like the Asian stores because they are good, cheap, and convenient. I live nearby. There are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This makes it easy to buy food.\n\nBensonhurt is not just Asian people. It is a mix of people from many countries. Immigrants and their children live here. Most of the big businesses are owned by Asians. There is also a park nearby. It has many things for people to do. There are basketball courts, a big field, handball courts, and a playground for children. In the summer, children can play with water.\n\nThe buildings in Bensonhurt are not very tall. Most people live in small houses or apartments. The people here are nice, but it can be noisy. You will hear cars with loud music and people driving fast. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurt is usually safe, but some people can be mean. I was once hurt here, but it was a long time ago. Recently, some people stole packages from houses. People also do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the ground every morning. Keep your shoes clean when you walk around.",
            "I live in a place where there are few sidewalks. A big hill is near my house. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many people like to run up it. The road I live on is not good for driving. There are many holes in it. Everyone walks on the road because there are no sidewalks. The telephone and electric wires around our block are old and broken. It rains a lot where I live. The wind and rain break the wires and cause problems. We have to repair them often.\n\nThere are many big trees in my area. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to look at the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset when the water is lit from below and the sky is orange. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on many things: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car alone for a month, and when I got back, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near my house. But most people in my area are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs like to run in people's yards or down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nWe also have rabbits in our area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see many birds: small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles fly by. The neighborhood crows chase them away. We do not have stores nearby, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The bay is not very wide, but you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a typical neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. The town is between two state highways. We have some traffic on our street, but it is mostly quiet. Few people move in and out of the neighborhood, so I know most of the people who live here. They like to take care of their lawns and do other daily tasks. In the winter, we sled down a hill on the side street. Our house is at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going. We pay attention to any strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and play. We are home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us: my wife and two daughters (eleven and fourteen years old). So, everyone is used to us coming and going. We go outside and play, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck and it smells nice. We can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. We have many trees, so it is shady. We have to rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. It is a sign that fall has arrived. We do not have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. I like to work in my garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. It is quiet on holidays. Thanksgiving and other holidays have extra cars because people visit from out of town. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the high desert. It is a very dry place with much dirt. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like to see brown everywhere. When I first moved here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now, there are many more houses. My neighborhood is becoming more like a city. But this is true of many places.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are friendly. However, like many cities, it has good and bad parts. I live near many older people. They are kind. In my neighborhood, there are many stores with chains, such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want organic food, you must go to a different place. \n\nThe main jobs in my city are in construction. This is because my city is still growing and there is much space to build. I am worried about this. I do not want my city to change too much. I came from a big city and do not want to go back.\n\nMy job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bar. What I like about my home is the animals. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has many plants and animals that need protecting. It is good to learn about these animals so we can live together safely. My family and I like the animals. My three children like to catch lizards and bugs.\n\nWe have some fun things to do in my city. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. You can see the snow-covered mountains and take lessons to learn how to ski. If you like history and nature, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many things to show you about the desert and the people who live here.",
            "I live in a special kind of neighborhood. It is not like other neighborhoods. I live on a college campus. My dormitory is my community. I also consider the campus around me my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses where I live. First, there are apartments. Each apartment has four rooms. Twenty people live in each building. Second, there are houses that people rent. These houses have two or four bedrooms. Not many people live in these houses. Finally, there are rooms in the dormitory where two people live. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nPeople from many countries and ages live in my neighborhood. The school is proud of its diversity. Most of the staff live in the houses. New students live in the dormitory. Older students live in the apartments.\n\nLet's talk about the stores. My school is a closed community. It has many stores. There are places to buy food, clothes and other things. All the things people need are in the neighborhood.\n\nThere is a park in my neighborhood. It is a good place for people to play. The park is clean and safe. All the people in my neighborhood help keep it that way.",
            "I live in my neighborhood for 10 years. I was sad when I first moved here. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and friends. But my mom and dad said this was a better place for us. We have a good house and a good school. It was not a bad neighborhood.\n\nOver time, I got used to it. I made some new friends. I also made some enemies in school. I did not know my neighbors very well. But Mr. Glen and his family were nice. They lived next to us. I also knew Dennis a little bit.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I danced with his daughter, Marsharii. I hope she is doing well. My mom and dad and my sister also went to the wedding. We all had a good time.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. But I have a GPS now. I can explore it more. I like to play video games with my friends Kason and Curtis. We have fun together. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm.\n\nI like to practice my balance with sticks. I also like to play with my bokken wooden sword. There are a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. They made us practice hard. But we had fun.\n\nI have had some good times in this neighborhood. I have a lot of memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. This is good for me. I like it. There are many apartment buildings in my neighborhood. Some restaurants and bars are also near me. These places are fun to visit and not very expensive. One of the bars was recently renamed. It costs more money to go there, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people in my neighborhood are nice. They are either college students or they do not have a lot of money. The apartments are not very expensive. There is a school near me for young children. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My landlord put a machine in their apartment to make the air smell good. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It feels insulting. The buildings around me are old and may need repair. A little ways down the street are new apartments. I do not like them. They are not well built, but the rent is high. I think this is unfair. They are close to the college, so the landlords can charge a lot of money. There is a cheap restaurant near me that serves food on paper plates. Most of the food is heated in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is a bad place to work. The city gave some money to fix the road near my apartment. Now the sidewalk is big and nice, and there are many trees and grass. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. Some of these trees were cut down, but there are many still left. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street. The street behind me is 43rd street. This street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they may be hiding the condition of the buildings. Many crimes have happened at an apartment complex on this street. But I do not blame them. There are also apartments across from me with problems. But I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many useful things near me. I like being close to the university and the two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses on a special street. The houses are close to each other and look like small towns. They have yellow paint and white porches. Almost everyone knows each other. We often stand at the end of our driveways and talk to each other. Our children play together outside. It is a nice change from the busy world. It feels like the past. We live near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and fluffy. But sometimes we have problems with big storms. This season, we had many warnings for tornadoes. One night, we even heard sirens. We went to a safe place in our house. My little dog was with me. My big dog stayed outside and barked. The storm brought big hail. After the storm, the road was hot and wet. We went from hot to cool in a short time. The hail melted on the hot road. As the sun came out, it started to rain. We saw a beautiful rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. We stayed inside for a little while. Then, people started coming home. Life went back to normal. We cooked dinner and talked outside. I like this neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a small apartment with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. But each apartment is different inside. Some are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond, but it is not for swimming. I have seen deer and birds. In the morning, I hear a big frog singing. It is a nice place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to a boy who lives two houses down from me and another boy who lives on my street. They are not there anymore, but the memories are still with me. Many of the people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. The neighborhood has many two-story houses. When the weather is warm, I hear kids playing outside every weekend. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I never have problems with my neighbors. If I need help, they will help me. I have ordered packages online many times and never lost one. I trust my neighbors. There is a park just a minute from my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the other boys in the neighborhood. I also have a bad memory there - I got hit in the nose playing football. But the good memories are more than the bad. Now, I go to the park to play with my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time because it reminds me of my neighborhood.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food near my house. In a short walk, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Most people order food online now. There are many fast food places near my house. There are also many stores near my house. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. There is even an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I read about problems with neighbors on social media, I am happy to have good neighbors like mine.",
            "My town is a small place in South Carolina. It is like other towns in the area. But it is important for farmers. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town says on its sign. Many farms have peach trees or cattle. Houses are far apart. They are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles to keep out the sun. Most houses are not near the road. They are set back so people can use the land for animals and crops. In the main part of town, there is a traffic light. This is where people can buy food. There are three places to get fast food. They are Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. A pizza place used to be there, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town, but people usually go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food. Many people like to go to Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in town for a long time and has people who will deliver your furniture. Next to the furniture store is a place to groom pets. They can take care of your pet while you are away. There is a doctor and a veterinarian in town, but they are not very big. There is a small school called Johnston Elementary. Students go to school there until they are in fifth grade. Then they go to school in another town. There are no parks in town, but they are building a small park. It will be 2.5 acres and people can go there to have fun. There are not many things to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice town.",
            "I heard a story about my place on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. My apartment costs more than a thousand dollars a month. I had not heard this story before. Neither had my friends. Perhaps it is the struggle. Some of my friends are sad every night. Life is expensive. But we know how to save money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. We like the smell of old magazines. It stays on old furniture even after we clean it. There are three second-hand stores near my home. I can walk there. I can visit two stores that help people, a place to borrow books, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are busy. Cars and people move every morning. But the stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Many people visit every year. The city is growing. A big company is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy. People do not ask for help. I can be alone and quiet. People do not bother me. It is not like the South. People care about each other in the South. Here, people do not ask about each other's lives. I can be myself. The city is lively. I hear music next door and people singing upstairs. We are not just strangers. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. We help each other when we need it. I am lucky to live here. I like my neighbors. They are kind to me. I clean after myself. They do the same. We share food and mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern building. But my neighbors make me feel at home.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is part of a community with a homeowner's association. This means everything looks the same. The houses are well-maintained and single-family homes. They have small yards with grass, some pebbles, and short driveways. Some houses are one-story, but some are two-story. \n\nThe streets are always in good shape. You will not see potholes or broken roads. We have many families living here, but everyone takes care of their homes. You will not see individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get to your mailbox. There are also big lockers for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. We have a lot of land, which is good for many things. There are community pools that everyone can use. They are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking trails where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can run around the neighborhood to get exercise.\n\nMost people who live here are old, but we also have some middle-aged and young people. It is a safe area, and people take care of each other. We have a small city nearby. It is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need, like a shopping mall. It is not very big, but it has everything we need. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to the mall. There are many stores to choose from. We have good food stores and cheap stores. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and trails. It is easy to get to the city and all its stores.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city but not in it. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. Many people in this area have low incomes. They rent or own homes here. The houses are not expensive. The neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates are higher here than in other parts of the town. There have been some violent crimes near my home. For example, there were shootings and one person died. But we have not been hurt. Sometimes things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. I am lucky my family has not been hurt by crime.\n\nThe town I live in has a big problem. Many people here have died from taking too much of a strong drug called fentanyl. There are places in town to help people with addiction. They have centers to help people get better and teach others how to help too. We have a lot of good things in our town. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and workers are kind. My son has special needs, but he is happy and safe at school. The school has a group that helps parents and makes events to get families involved. They give free food to all students. No one goes hungry because they cannot pay. The town council is working to make our town look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But they have mainly done this in the center of town and on the other side where there are stores. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have everything we need. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is located on a hill. Many famous buildings are here. I live in a 7-story building near a historic theater. A short walk away is a small bar where people like to go in the summer. It is very popular. Some people wait in line to get in. Near my house is a big park. It is nice for people who live in the city. The park is fenced in and has many stairs. In the winter, some people who do not have a home sleep here. They set up tents and stay together for safety and warmth. This is better than sleeping alone.\n\nI like my city. It is not just the old buildings that are special. The people are also special. This neighborhood was once very bad. There were many gangs and violence. But the people here work hard to keep it safe. They take care of their city. They remember the past, but they are not afraid. They want people to know they are kind and caring.\n\nSome people say it is not safe to walk around at night. But I think this is not true. The people here are friendly. They are kind to me. They help me when I need it. I feel safe walking around at night. I like it here. No matter where I go, this will always be my home. The people here are like a family to me. They make me feel welcome and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a country place. People live in houses on the land. They have big yards. Most houses are old. Some are new. They are not the same. They are different. Many houses have basements. You can see them from the street. They have old aluminum siding. The houses are different colors. Some people have animals. They have yards with swings and playsets. The town is like America. People work to make money. They have families. On the street, you see children playing. You see people walking dogs and riding bikes. People know their neighbors. They are friendly. They say hello. The lawns are nice. The grass is cut. The flowers are trimmed. It is a quiet and safe place. People want to live here. It is near the police station and the hospital. People can recycle here. There is a park where children play sports. There are baseball and softball fields. You can also hear airplanes flying in and out of the small airport. You can walk to get ice cream or go to the store. My children can ride their bikes to the park. It is a nice place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood is interesting. It has single family houses. But some homes are divided into two parts, while still connected. My home has a small yard in front and a small driveway to the side. It is like the other houses. They look like they are from a long time ago. Back then, living in the suburbs was a popular choice for Americans. But now it is not as popular. My neighborhood still looks nice. It reminds people that the idea of a perfect life is still possible. The people are not as happy as they used to be. The yards are not well taken care of. But there are still cars in every driveway. Children play outside as if nothing is wrong. The public school has been there for almost 90 years. It still looks strong. The churches are few and are not used much. But the basketball courts are still popular. All the houses look different, but feel the same. There is a big store called \"A\" Supermarket. It is owned by a family from Yemen. They are probably the only family from Yemen in the neighborhood. Most people in the neighborhood are African American. The streets are wide. Children play football until cars come by. Most people have lived here for a long time. They know everyone. There was a karate school, but it closed when kids stopped wanting to be like the Karate Kid. Now it is a pharmacy. There is also a small movie theater that shows old movies at a low price. Most people do not like it because it does not have new movies. But older people like it because it is a cheap night out. There is a highway that goes through our town, but it only goes through the town next to us. Some people wanted to make an exit in our town, but others did not. They thought it would ruin the town. Now we are building a new school. We need to choose a symbol for our town. I think a robot with a country accent and a log cabin would be a good choice.",
            "You might not notice this place at first. It is a residential area behind a shopping strip. People may think it is not a good place to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned store and walk back behind the hotels, you will find a busy community. There are many apartment buildings here. They are next to each other like a series of small boxes.\n\nSome of these buildings have problems. We will not talk about those. But the other buildings are very different. They are near a small college. The college has a quiet campus where students go to learn. They often go there early in the morning with coffee in their hands.\n\nThe college is near a road. The road meets another road with a park on one side. There is a building where people go to get help when they are hurt. The building has a nice porch and a fan that makes the air feel cool.\n\nChildren play in the park. They run and jump on the grass. There are flowers near the road, and bees are flying around them. Old people walk their dogs on a path in the park. They see the young people on skateboards and the girls talking by the swings. There is a store near the park where you can buy cheap food. There is also a store where you can buy things for your pool. You can even get a manicure and eat while you are there. There is a store with frozen yogurt too. The young people like to buy yogurt and eat it while they are on their skateboards.\n\nThis neighborhood is a special place. It is a part of American life. It is a place where people live and do things. It is a place that does not change much.",
            "We drove past many corn fields. They went on forever. My friend was surprised by the empty space. She lived in a town where the grocery store was just a five-minute walk from her home. She had never seen so much open space before. I told her what it was like growing up in a small town in Ohio. After that, she understood who I was and where I came from.\n\nWe drove down a two-lane road. There was a big hole in the ground filled with water. Just past it was where I live. My home is in a small group of houses. They are made of brick and stucco. Each house has a lot of land, over half an acre. Everyone takes care of their yard. In the spring, people plant flowers. The trees change with the seasons. The driveways have big, luxury cars. They shine in the sun after they are washed. My neighbor was mowing his lawn. He was singing a happy song. My friend and I laughed. He is a kind person with an interesting past. He used to be a doctor. He is older now and a little slower. He still mows his lawn every day.\n\nAs we kept driving, we reached my house. There were many geese in the yard. Our dog was chasing them. Behind the house, there was a small stream. The sound of the stream and the frogs was loud. Sometimes we could hear cows from the farms nearby. Across a small bridge made of wood, there was a quiet place. There were many trees, herbs, and wildflowers. That was where I spent most of my childhood. I built forts and chased animals. I had friends in the neighborhood. In the winter, the town could be very cold. But it was also very beautiful. The trees were empty and the flowers were gone. Sometimes it snowed and a winter wonderland appeared. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot when we were kids. But in the winter, we just played and had fun.",
            "Portland, Oregon is an interesting city. The city's unofficial slogan is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" This means that people in Portland like to do things their own way. They like to be different. Some people remember the city as it was in the 1990s and early 2000s. It was less well-known and less expensive. The city had many creative and unique cultures.\n\nToday, many people from California are moving to Portland. They are building new homes and businesses. But Portland is still weird. Weird means accepting of things that are not normal. People in Portland do not always judge others for being different. They have yoga and hipsters and business people like other cities. But in Portland, they just do not take things as seriously.\n\nMy neighborhood is colorful. There are beautiful homes, gardens with flowers and herbs, and free boxes on the sidewalk in the summer. Free boxes are boxes with things that people are giving away. They can have clothes, books, or anything else. Walking through my neighborhood is fun. You might find something interesting.\n\nPortland is full of people who love many things. Some people go to goat yoga. Others like to watch the city's soccer team. Portland has a drug problem. It is caused by mental health issues. The rain and cloudy weather may also be a problem. The city also has a homelessness problem. Many people come to Portland because it has good social services. But the services are not enough.\n\nPeople in Portland are not strange about this problem. They are confused. They do not know what to do. Some people care about the homeless, but others do not. This is like other cities in the United States.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They watch the sun every day. The sun rises and sets in front of them. The mountains do not change. They are steady and strong. They do not care about our problems. But when we are sad or stressed, they call to us. We look at them and feel better. They give us strength to keep going.\n\nI first saw the mountains when I was in college. They are near the university. The campus is nice, but the mountains are special. There are many beautiful things on campus, like buildings and ponds and trees. But the mountains are the most beautiful. The rest of the town is nice too. There are many coffee shops where I studied for long time. You can walk or take a bus to the downtown area. It is old and interesting. The buildings are old and colorful.\n\nThe town has two different feelings. It is busy and fun in the downtown area. But you can also be quiet and peaceful in the small town. The library is a quiet place. You can go there to think and relax. This town has a special feeling. It invites you to explore it. I made many happy memories in this town. I walked with my friends through the park at night. We went to the movie theater and watched a movie. But I also made sad memories. We all make memories, both good and bad. The ponds are a good place to think and cry. I have cried there many times.\n\nI walked near the pond and the park and the houses. I saw the sun shining on the palm trees. The sky was beautiful. I looked up and saw the mountains. They were strong and steady. They reminded me to be strong too. They told me to keep going.",
            "Bensonhurt is a neighborhood in Brooklyn. If you visit, you will not have trouble finding it. The public transportation is good. Many people use it. Bensonhurt is a busy place. You will still feel like you are in New York City. When you walk around, you will see many Asian stores. Many people from Asia live here. Over the past twenty years, the number of Asian people in Bensonhurt has increased. As a result, you will see one Asian store every few blocks. Many people like the Asian stores because they are good, cheap, and convenient. I live nearby. There are four Asian supermarkets within a short walk. This makes it easy to buy food.\n\nBensonhurt is not just Asian people. It is a mix of people from many countries. Immigrants and their children live here. Most of the big businesses are owned by Asians. There is also a park nearby. It has many things for people to do. There are basketball courts, a big field, handball courts, and a playground for children. In the summer, children can play with water.\n\nThe buildings in Bensonhurt are not very tall. Most people live in small houses or apartments. The people here are nice, but it can be noisy. You will hear cars with loud music and people driving fast. If you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurt is usually safe, but some people can be mean. I was once hurt here, but it was a long time ago. Recently, some people stole packages from houses. People also do not clean up after their dogs. You will see dog waste on the ground every morning. Keep your shoes clean when you walk around.",
            "I live in a place where there are few sidewalks. A big hill is near my house. People call it the \"workout hill\" because many people like to run up it. The road I live on is not good for driving. There are many holes in it. Everyone walks on the road because there are no sidewalks. The telephone and electric wires around our block are old and broken. It rains a lot where I live. The wind and rain break the wires and cause problems. We have to repair them often.\n\nThere are many big trees in my area. But people do not like the trees. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. That is why many houses are built high up on the hill. They have big windows to look at the ocean. It is beautiful at sunset when the water is lit from below and the sky is orange. But most days are cloudy and wet. Moss grows on many things: roofs, cars, and railings. I left my car alone for a month, and when I got back, it was covered in moss. It took me three hours to clean it off.\n\nThere are not many children in my neighborhood. There is a school near my house. But most people in my area are old and retired. They have dogs instead of children. Dogs like to run in people's yards or down the street. If you leave a door or window open, they might come in. I once found a dog in my living room and had to chase it out.\n\nWe also have rabbits in our area. They dig up plants and make holes in people's lawns. My cats like to hunt them. We also see many birds: small birds, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles fly by. The neighborhood crows chase them away. We do not have stores nearby, but if you walk down to the waterfront, there are some restaurants that serve fresh seafood. The bay is not very wide, but you can see the other side even on cloudy days.",
            "I live in a typical neighborhood in a small town in Tennessee. The town is between two state highways. We have some traffic on our street, but it is mostly quiet. Few people move in and out of the neighborhood, so I know most of the people who live here. They like to take care of their lawns and do other daily tasks. In the winter, we sled down a hill on the side street. Our house is at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going. We pay attention to any strange cars. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Children ride their bikes and play. We are home a lot because we work from home. There are four of us: my wife and two daughters (eleven and fourteen years old). So, everyone is used to us coming and going. We go outside and play, even in the rain. We sometimes grill on our back deck and it smells nice. We can hear a lawn mower almost every day from March to October. We have many trees, so it is shady. We have to rake and burn leaves in the fall. I like the smell of burning leaves. It is a sign that fall has arrived. We do not have much winter, so it feels like a long fall. I like to work in my garage, and when the garage doors are open, I feel connected to the neighborhood. It is quiet on holidays. Thanksgiving and other holidays have extra cars because people visit from out of town. I like living here. If it were not a through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood in the high desert. It is a very dry place with much dirt. If you have not lived here, you may not understand what it is like to see brown everywhere. When I first moved here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now, there are many more houses. My neighborhood is becoming more like a city. But this is true of many places.\n\nMost people in my neighborhood are friendly. However, like many cities, it has good and bad parts. I live near many older people. They are kind. In my neighborhood, there are many stores with chains, such as Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want organic food, you must go to a different place. \n\nThe main jobs in my city are in construction. This is because my city is still growing and there is much space to build. I am worried about this. I do not want my city to change too much. I came from a big city and do not want to go back.\n\nMy job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bar. What I like about my home is the animals. People come to the high desert for its beauty. The desert has many plants and animals that need protecting. It is good to learn about these animals so we can live together safely. My family and I like the animals. My three children like to catch lizards and bugs.\n\nWe have some fun things to do in my city. Victorville is a good place for families to visit the desert. You can see the snow-covered mountains and take lessons to learn how to ski. If you like history and nature, you can visit the Victor Valley Museum. It has many things to show you about the desert and the people who live here.",
            "I live in a special kind of neighborhood. It is not like other neighborhoods. I live on a college campus. My dormitory is my community. I also consider the campus around me my neighborhood. My neighborhood is like other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores and parks.\n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses where I live. First, there are apartments. Each apartment has four rooms. Twenty people live in each building. Second, there are houses that people rent. These houses have two or four bedrooms. Not many people live in these houses. Finally, there are rooms in the dormitory where two people live. Many students live in these rooms.\n\nPeople from many countries and ages live in my neighborhood. The school is proud of its diversity. Most of the staff live in the houses. New students live in the dormitory. Older students live in the apartments.\n\nLet's talk about the stores. My school is a closed community. It has many stores. There are places to buy food, clothes and other things. All the things people need are in the neighborhood.\n\nThere is a park in my neighborhood. It is a good place for people to play. The park is clean and safe. All the people in my neighborhood help keep it that way.",
            "I live in my neighborhood for 10 years. I was sad when I first moved here. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge. I missed my old home and friends. But my mom and dad said this was a better place for us. We have a good house and a good school. It was not a bad neighborhood.\n\nOver time, I got used to it. I made some new friends. I also made some enemies in school. I did not know my neighbors very well. But Mr. Glen and his family were nice. They lived next to us. I also knew Dennis a little bit.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun. I danced with his daughter, Marsharii. I hope she is doing well. My mom and dad and my sister also went to the wedding. We all had a good time.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. But I have a GPS now. I can explore it more. I like to play video games with my friends Kason and Curtis. We have fun together. I also like to go to the park and enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm.\n\nI like to practice my balance with sticks. I also like to play with my bokken wooden sword. There are a basketball and tennis court in the neighborhood. I used to play tennis with my dad and Mr. Graves. They made us practice hard. But we had fun.\n\nI have had some good times in this neighborhood. I have a lot of memories. I think the best times are yet to come.",
            "I live near the college I attend. This is good for me. I like it. There are many apartment buildings in my neighborhood. Some restaurants and bars are also near me. These places are fun to visit and not very expensive. One of the bars was recently renamed. It costs more money to go there, but the service and drinks are not bad. Most people in my neighborhood are nice. They are either college students or they do not have a lot of money. The apartments are not very expensive. There is a school near me for young children. I do not know my neighbors well. They smoke a lot of marijuana. My landlord put a machine in their apartment to make the air smell good. My boyfriend and I think this is funny. It feels insulting. The buildings around me are old and may need repair. A little ways down the street are new apartments. I do not like them. They are not well built, but the rent is high. I think this is unfair. They are close to the college, so the landlords can charge a lot of money. There is a cheap restaurant near me that serves food on paper plates. Most of the food is heated in a microwave. Across from this restaurant is a gas station. I have heard it is a bad place to work. The city gave some money to fix the road near my apartment. Now the sidewalk is big and nice, and there are many trees and grass. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. Some of these trees were cut down, but there are many still left. Behind my building is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd street. The street behind me is 43rd street. This street is not as nice. The sidewalk is broken, and the buildings look old. There are many trees on this street, but they may be hiding the condition of the buildings. Many crimes have happened at an apartment complex on this street. But I do not blame them. There are also apartments across from me with problems. But I like where I live. I can afford it, and there are many useful things near me. I like being close to the university and the two bus stops.",
            "My neighborhood is made up of houses on a special street. The houses are close to each other and look like small towns. They have yellow paint and white porches. Almost everyone knows each other. We often stand at the end of our driveways and talk to each other. Our children play together outside. It is a nice change from the busy world. It feels like the past. We live near fields and trees. The sky is blue and the clouds are white and fluffy. But sometimes we have problems with big storms. This season, we had many warnings for tornadoes. One night, we even heard sirens. We went to a safe place in our house. My little dog was with me. My big dog stayed outside and barked. The storm brought big hail. After the storm, the road was hot and wet. We went from hot to cool in a short time. The hail melted on the hot road. As the sun came out, it started to rain. We saw a beautiful rainbow. I took a picture with my camera. We stayed inside for a little while. Then, people started coming home. Life went back to normal. We cooked dinner and talked outside. I like this neighborhood. I moved here from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I like the way people talk here. I have a small apartment with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. But each apartment is different inside. Some are very small. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. I go to the pond, but it is not for swimming. I have seen deer and birds. In the morning, I hear a big frog singing. It is a nice place to live, near the city of Charlotte. Each morning, I hear roosters crowing from the farms. It is like living in a small village. We have a donkey that brays in the evening. I am lucky to live here.",
            "I moved to this neighborhood when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first, but I got close to a boy who lives two houses down from me and another boy who lives on my street. They are not there anymore, but the memories are still with me. Many of the people who lived here when I first moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like many American suburban neighborhoods. The neighborhood has many two-story houses. When the weather is warm, I hear kids playing outside every weekend. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I never have problems with my neighbors. If I need help, they will help me. I have ordered packages online many times and never lost one. I trust my neighbors. There is a park just a minute from my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with the other boys in the neighborhood. I also have a bad memory there - I got hit in the nose playing football. But the good memories are more than the bad. Now, I go to the park to play with my cousin's kids. They are younger than me and like to play on swings and slides. The park makes me happy and sad at the same time because it reminds me of my neighborhood.\n\nThe neighborhood is diverse. You can find many kinds of food near my house. In a short walk, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Most people order food online now. There are many fast food places near my house. There are also many stores near my house. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a grocery store. There is even an Indian store where you can buy Indian food. I like my neighborhood. When I read about problems with neighbors on social media, I am happy to have good neighbors like mine.",
            "My town is a small place in South Carolina. It is like other towns in the area. But it is important for farmers. Johnston is called the Peach Capital of the World. This is what the town says on its sign. Many farms have peach trees or cattle. Houses are far apart. They are usually two stories high with metal roofs or gray shingles to keep out the sun. Most houses are not near the road. They are set back so people can use the land for animals and crops. In the main part of town, there is a traffic light. This is where people can buy food. There are three places to get fast food. They are Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a small burger place. A pizza place used to be there, but it closed. There is a small pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug. They are famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a small grocery store called IGA. It is the only store in town, but people usually go to a bigger store in another town to buy most of their food. Many people like to go to Dollar General. It sells many things and is very busy. There is a small furniture store called Possibilities Furniture & More. It has been in town for a long time and has people who will deliver your furniture. Next to the furniture store is a place to groom pets. They can take care of your pet while you are away. There is a doctor and a veterinarian in town, but they are not very big. There is a small school called Johnston Elementary. Students go to school there until they are in fifth grade. Then they go to school in another town. There are no parks in town, but they are building a small park. It will be 2.5 acres and people can go there to have fun. There are not many things to do in town. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds. But it is a nice town.",
            "I heard a story about my place on a podcast. It was about people who disappeared. My apartment costs more than a thousand dollars a month. I had not heard this story before. Neither had my friends. Perhaps it is the struggle. Some of my friends are sad every night. Life is expensive. But we know how to save money. We like second-hand things. We like the smell of old toys and old clothes. We like the smell of old magazines. It stays on old furniture even after we clean it. There are three second-hand stores near my home. I can walk there. I can visit two stores that help people, a place to borrow books, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. The streets are busy. Cars and people move every morning. But the stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend the afternoon. Many people visit every year. The city is growing. A big company is here. The city is still growing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is busy. People do not ask for help. I can be alone and quiet. People do not bother me. It is not like the South. People care about each other in the South. Here, people do not ask about each other's lives. I can be myself. The city is lively. I hear music next door and people singing upstairs. We are not just strangers. We help each other. We celebrate birthdays and funerals. We help each other when we need it. I am lucky to live here. I like my neighbors. They are kind to me. I clean after myself. They do the same. We share food and mail. It is nice to see them. I think they like my company as much as I like theirs. I live in a big, modern building. But my neighbors make me feel at home.",
            "I live in a typical suburban area. My neighborhood is part of a community with a homeowner's association. This means everything looks the same. The houses are well-maintained and single-family homes. They have small yards with grass, some pebbles, and short driveways. Some houses are one-story, but some are two-story. \n\nThe streets are always in good shape. You will not see potholes or broken roads. We have many families living here, but everyone takes care of their homes. You will not see individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are many mailboxes at the end of the street. You need a key to get to your mailbox. There are also big lockers for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. We have a lot of land, which is good for many things. There are community pools that everyone can use. They are well-maintained and locked. We also have walking trails where you can walk your dog or go for a walk. You can run around the neighborhood to get exercise.\n\nMost people who live here are old, but we also have some middle-aged and young people. It is a safe area, and people take care of each other. We have a small city nearby. It is big, but it feels small. We have many things we need, like a shopping mall. It is not very big, but it has everything we need. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to the mall. There are many stores to choose from. We have good food stores and cheap stores. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and nice. We have many good things, like pools and trails. It is easy to get to the city and all its stores.",
            "I live in a small town in the Midwest. It is near a big city but not in it. My neighborhood is on the east side of the town. Many people in this area have low incomes. They rent or own homes here. The houses are not expensive. The neighbors are friendly. They say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates are higher here than in other parts of the town. There have been some violent crimes near my home. For example, there were shootings and one person died. But we have not been hurt. Sometimes things go missing from our porch if we leave them outside. Our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting near a bar. I am lucky my family has not been hurt by crime.\n\nThe town I live in has a big problem. Many people here have died from taking too much of a strong drug called fentanyl. There are places in town to help people with addiction. They have centers to help people get better and teach others how to help too. We have a lot of good things in our town. My son's school is excellent. The teachers and workers are kind. My son has special needs, but he is happy and safe at school. The school has a group that helps parents and makes events to get families involved. They give free food to all students. No one goes hungry because they cannot pay. The town council is working to make our town look better. They have fixed roads and parks. But they have mainly done this in the center of town and on the other side where there are stores. I like living in this town. People are friendly, the schools are good, and we have everything we need. Our home is not worth much, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for 16 years and do not want to move.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is located on a hill. Many famous buildings are here. I live in a 7-story building near a historic theater. A short walk away is a small bar where people like to go in the summer. It is very popular. Some people wait in line to get in. Near my house is a big park. It is nice for people who live in the city. The park is fenced in and has many stairs. In the winter, some people who do not have a home sleep here. They set up tents and stay together for safety and warmth. This is better than sleeping alone.\n\nI like my city. It is not just the old buildings that are special. The people are also special. This neighborhood was once very bad. There were many gangs and violence. But the people here work hard to keep it safe. They take care of their city. They remember the past, but they are not afraid. They want people to know they are kind and caring.\n\nSome people say it is not safe to walk around at night. But I think this is not true. The people here are friendly. They are kind to me. They help me when I need it. I feel safe walking around at night. I like it here. No matter where I go, this will always be my home. The people here are like a family to me. They make me feel welcome and valuable.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a country place. People live in houses on the land. They have big yards. Most houses are old. Some are new. They are not the same. They are different. Many houses have basements. You can see them from the street. They have old aluminum siding. The houses are different colors. Some people have animals. They have yards with swings and playsets. The town is like America. People work to make money. They have families. On the street, you see children playing. You see people walking dogs and riding bikes. People know their neighbors. They are friendly. They say hello. The lawns are nice. The grass is cut. The flowers are trimmed. It is a quiet and safe place. People want to live here. It is near the police station and the hospital. People can recycle here. There is a park where children play sports. There are baseball and softball fields. You can also hear airplanes flying in and out of the small airport. You can walk to get ice cream or go to the store. My children can ride their bikes to the park. It is a nice place to live."
