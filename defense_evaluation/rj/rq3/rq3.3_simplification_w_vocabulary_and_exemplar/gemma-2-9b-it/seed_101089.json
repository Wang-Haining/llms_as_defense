            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My area is interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some homes are split in two, still joined. My house has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the side. It is like the others, showing a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream seemed good for everyone, but it feels different now.  Still, my area and others like it say the dream is still here. People are still trying to hold onto it. People are not as happy as they were. Yards are not as neat. But there are cars in every driveway. Kids still play like the world is all around them. The public school is almost ninety years old. It is still there. It makes the kids think about the future and reminds older people of the past. There are not many churches, mostly empty. But the basketball courts are full. The houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big store called Super \"A\". It is owned by a big family from Yemen. They are probably the only Arab family in the area. Most people are African American. The streets are wide and kids play football. They stop only for cars. Most people in my area have lived here for a long time. They can tell stories about when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but kids stopped going when Hollywood stopped making karate movies. Now it is a pharmacy. Drugs are good, I have heard. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies for less money. Young people do not go because they want new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap. There is one highway that goes through our town. The entrances and exits are in the next town.  There was a plan to make exits for our town, but the young people wanted it, and the older people said no. They said the highway would ruin the town. They told the city council to say no. They are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be good.",

It is hidden.\n\nApartment buildings stand close together. They look like Russian nesting dolls, placed side by side. Some buildings are bad. We will not talk about them. But the next buildings are very different. A small college is nearby. Students go there. They drink coffee and go to class. Cars drive by and get angry at the students.\n\nThe road goes to another street. A park is on one side, and a place to heal broken bones is on the other. People sit on the porch with fans. Children play in the park. Old people walk dogs and watch the young people. \n\nThere are stores near the park. A place to eat sushi, a place for swimming supplies, and a place for nails. You can eat, buy things, and get a manicure, all in one place. \n\nThere is also a place for frozen yogurt. The young people eat it and ride skateboards. This area is like a picture from the past.",
            "She asked, \"Where is everything?\" We drove past the corn fields. The fields went on and on. I knew she would be surprised. She was from a town where you could walk to the store. She had never seen so much open space.  I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she understood me better. \n\nWe drove down a small road.  You will see a lake. Just past the lake is my home. My neighborhood has small houses made of brick and stucco. Each house has a lot of land. People take pride in keeping their yards nice. In the spring, there are many flowers. The trees change color with each season.  The driveways have expensive cars. They shine in the sun after a wash.\n\nMy neighbor, who is Korean, lives near my house. He is always outside. He mows his lawn all day. You can hear him singing. Everyone laughs at him, but he is a kind man. He was a doctor before. Now he works with his lawn mower. It looks like a big green tractor.\n\nMy house is gray.  There are geese in my side yard. My dog chases them. There is a small stream behind my house. You can hear frogs, the water, and cows in the distance.\n\nAcross a bridge is a special place.

            "Portland, Oregon has a special kind of strange. People say \"Keep Portland Weird,\" this is on a building that sells pizza and serves drinks. It also plays music and lets people dance. The slogan shows people want to keep Portland different. Some people think it means remembering the old Portland, when it was less famous. It was a place for creative people. Others think it means come to Portland and be different. You will be accepted.\n\nPortland is still weird, even with new people moving here. Many people from California have moved to Portland to live. They build new houses for people to live in. But Portland is still unique.\n\n\"Weird\" does not mean everyone is always nice. It means accepting things that are not normal. Portland has many things like other cities. People buy things made in China. There are many ways to be unique. Portland has people who do yoga, people who like fashion, and people who work in offices. Maybe weird means people in Portland do not take things so seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, houses are brightly colored. People grow flowers, herbs, and vegetables in their gardens.

There are not many big buildings in Bensonhurst. The buildings are for apartments or homes. Most people live in two-family houses.\n\nMost people are nice, but it can be noisy. Cars play loud music and drive fast.\n\nIf you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurst is safe, but people can be mean. You may meet people who want to fight or steal. I was bullied here many years ago. Recently, there have been reports of stolen packages.\n\nPeople do not always clean up after their dogs, even though there is a fine for doing so.\n\nYou will see dog waste on the streets. Look out for it!",
            "My house is at the top of a big hill. People call it the \"work out hill\" because runners like to run up it. There are no sidewalks, so people walk on the road. The road is bad in some places. Some wires are old and broken. It rains a lot, so the wires are often fixed. There are many tall trees. People want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are high up to see the ocean. The sunset is beautiful. The water is lit up, and the sky is orange. It is often cloudy, so the sun is not always bright. It is often wet.\n\nThere are not many children. There are many old people. People have dogs. They run in the yards. Be careful, they might go into your house! Rabbits live here, too. Gardens do not like them. My cats catch them. We have birds, too. Sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles. \n\nThere are no stores near my house. If you walk down to the water, there are some restaurants. The beach is small. The rocks are fun to throw in the water. The bay is not wide. You can see the other side.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My home is in a quiet area. It is near two big roads. We see many cars each day. I know most of the people who live near me. They do normal things like work in their yards. In winter, we use a hill to sled. We live at the beginning of our street. We see many cars every day. We remember new cars. Some people walk for exercise. Children ride bikes. My family is home often. There are four of us: me, my wife, and our two daughters. They are eleven and fourteen years old. People know us well. We play outside, even in the rain. We often cook outside. It smells good. Many people cut grass. You can hear the sound of mowers from March until October. \n\nWe have many trees. They make shade. In fall, there are many leaves. We rake and burn them. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. This year, we have not had much cold weather.\n\nOur garage is behind our house. We use the front door only when someone visits. I work in the garage on my truck. When the doors are open, I feel closer to my neighborhood. Our street is quiet on holidays. On Thanksgiving, people visit from other places. There are many cars. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. It would be better if it was not a busy road.",
            "My area is in the center of the high desert. There is a lot of dirt. People who have not lived here may not understand. The color is always brown. If you see a green lawn, it means someone spends a lot of money on it.\n\nWhen I first lived here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses, but they are still spread out. It looks more like a city now, but many places are changing.\n\nMost people are friendly. Like any place, there are good parts and bad parts. I live in a nice area with many friendly older people. \n\nThe stores are big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For smaller stores, you have to travel. I do not see many Whole Foods or similar stores.\n\nI think many people work in construction. The city is not very built up, so there is still a lot of space to build. I like it the way it is. I moved from a big city and do not want to go back.\n\nI work in construction as a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nI like the animals here. People come to the desert for many reasons. One reason is the beauty. The desert has tough environments that need protection. These environments are home to many types of animals. People who live here should learn about these animals to live together safely.\n\nMy family and I get along well with the animals. My three children love lizards and desert bugs.\n\nVictorville has some things to see. It is a good place for families to experience the desert.\n\nThe San Bernardino County Fair is held here every year. It is a fun event.\n\nYou can visit Wrightwood nearby to see snowy mountains.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum has rocks, bones, Native American objects, and things that show the history of Victorville.",
            "My neighborhood is a little different. I live on a college campus. The people in my dorm are my neighbors.  The campus is also my neighborhood, but not as close as my dorm. My neighborhood has houses, people, stores, and parks, just like other neighborhoods.\n\nFirst, there are three types of houses: apartments, regular houses, and dorm houses. Apartments have 2 to 4 people per room, and there are 4 to 6 rooms per floor. Most apartments have two floors, so about 20 people live in each building.\n\nRegular houses are for rent by anyone connected to the school. They have 2 to 4 bedrooms and mostly alumni live there. There are not many of these houses. Dorm houses are for students. Hundreds of students live in these houses. Two students share a room, except for a few cases. \n\nMy school has many different people. There are people from many cultures and ages. Staff members live in the regular houses. Newer students live in dorms, and older students live in apartments. \n\nThe campus has many stores. There are places to eat, and stores that sell school clothes and food. You can find almost anything you need on campus. \n\nThere is one park on campus. Everyone in the neighborhood uses it. It is clean and safe.",
            "I have lived here for ten years. When I first came to Stockbridge from Riverdale, I was sad. I missed my old home and friends. My parents wanted a better life for me and my sister, so we moved. We got a new house, a good high school, and a safer place to live.\n\nAt first, I made new friends and some new enemies at school. I did not get to know many neighbors except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis for a little while. They are good people, like family to me.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family. It was fun! I caught a piece of his wife’s dress when she threw it. I hope his wife, Ms. Veda, is happy. I enjoyed dancing with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I hope she is doing well.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to explore it. I have been to the park with my friends, Kason and Curtis. We played video games and had fun.\n\nThe park is peaceful. I like to go there to relax. I also practice my balance with sticks from the hardware store and sometimes bring my wooden sword. There is a basketball and tennis court, but I haven’t played in a long time.\n\nMy dad taught me and my best friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a great time. We worked hard, but we always had fun.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. I look forward to more happy memories in the future.",
            "My home is near my school. I like living there. There are many apartment buildings. There are also a few restaurants and bars. They are not very expensive. One bar just changed names. It is more expensive, but the drinks are good. Most people are nice. They are students or have low incomes. The rent is low. There are many children near my home. There is a school close by. I do not know my neighbors. I do not want to. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The building managers put air freshener near their door. It is funny. The buildings are old, but may have new insides. Down the street are new apartments. I do not like them. They are not built well, but the rent is high. The buildings are near the school, so the managers can charge more. There is a cheap restaurant nearby. They serve food on paper plates. Most food is warmed up in the microwave. Across the street is a gas station. People say it is a bad place to work. The city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a good sidewalk, grass, and the area is nicer. My building has many trees. They cut down some trees, but there are many left. Behind my building is a line of trees, then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind me is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad. The buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. Maybe they hide the buildings. Most crime in the area has happened at an apartment complex on this street. But I cannot blame them alone. There are other apartments across the street with crime and many people moving in and out. I like where I live. It is affordable and there are many things nearby. I like that the university is walkable and there are two bus stops. I can go to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My area has small houses. They are close together, but they look like they are far apart. All the houses are yellow with white front porches and green roofs. Almost everyone knows each other. We talk in the evenings. The small children play outside. It is nice to be in a place that is not filled with computers and machines. It feels like we are back in time. \n\nWe live near fields and trees. The sky is blue. There are white clouds in the sky. The bad thing is that we have storms. Last week, we had a warning about a tornado. We heard the sirens and went to a safe place.\n\nMy small dog went with me. My big dog stayed in the living room and was scared. We heard big hail fall on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot. The hail melted quickly.\n\nAfter the storm, a rainbow appeared. I took pictures to share with my friends. Then, people came home. Everything was normal again.\n\nI live in a two-bedroom apartment. Everyone else in the area lives in the same kind of apartment. The inside of the apartments are different. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my apartment. There is a pond there. I have seen deer. I hear a big frog sing in the morning.\n\nIt is a good place to live. It is close to the city. I hear roosters crow in the morning. It feels like a small village. We even have a donkey that makes noise in the evening. I am happy that I found this place.",
            "I lived in this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. I made friends with two boys. One lived two houses down. The other lived on my street.  They do not live here anymore, but I remember them. \n\nThe people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like other American neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses. On warm days, I hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had any problems with neighbors. People leave each other alone unless they need help.\n\nI have ordered things online and never had a package taken. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball there. I also got hurt there once playing football. But the good memories are better. Now, I go to the park with my cousins' children. They are young and like the swings and slides. Just thinking about the park makes them happy. The park makes me feel nostalgic.\n\nMy neighborhood is diverse. There are many kinds of food. Close by, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Some people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food. Fast food is popular, but you can find it anywhere. There are many pizza places too.\n\nThe stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There is even an Indian store. Overall, I like my neighborhood. Seeing bad things happen to people in other neighborhoods makes me thankful for mine.",
            "My town is small. It is in South Carolina. It is not special. But it has many peach farms. People call it the Peach Capital of the World. Most of the town is farm land. There are peach trees and cows.\n\nThe houses are far apart. Many are two stories. They have metal roofs or gray shingles. The houses are not near the road. They are back in the fields. There is one stop light in town. It is at a four way.\n\nThere are three places to buy fast food. There is a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, and a burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small drug store. It is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There is one grocery store, but people often go to a bigger store in another town. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things.\n\nThere is a small furniture store. It has been in town for a long time. There is a pet groomer next door. There is a doctor and a vet. They are small but good. There is one elementary school. Students go to school in another town for middle and high school.\n\nThere are no parks in town, but they are making one. There are not many things to do in town. There are no movies, bowling, or playgrounds. It is a quiet town.",
            "I first heard of my home when I listened to a podcast about missing people. It was a little strange. Most apartments here cost over a thousand dollars each month. I had not heard that story, and neither had my friends. Maybe it is the hard times. I know some friends cry at night. Things are expensive, but we have learned to save money. You learn to like old toys from the market and clothes that have been kept in storage. You do not smell as much when you are older. You might smoke, or you might just get used to things. But the market is always there. The smell of being an adult is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in your clothes even after you wash them. \n\nThere are three secondhand stores near here. If you start on one side, you can go to two charity stores, a library, a store for old books, and a shop with strange things. The city center is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you cannot hear it in the stores. It does not matter how many cars or people go by, the stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, there are more people and cars. It is a growing city, they say. It has one of the biggest online stores for buying and selling things. It is still growing and changing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is working on their own goals, and no one asks much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It is not like the South, where if you show a little concern, people think you care. No one asks about your life here. You can keep to yourself as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like waves on the beach. It is a lively place.\n\nBetween the piano player next door and the two people who sing upstairs, there is always something happening. In a way, we have less of an apartment building full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn deaths, and help each other when we can. In a way, I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same. I bring them mail, and they bring me mail. It is nice to see them, and I think they like me being here. I live in a big, impersonal city, but it is people like my neighbors that make me feel like I did not ruin my life.",
            "My area is a suburb. It is like many other suburbs. There is a group that looks after the houses. They make sure all the houses are the same.  There are small front yards with grass, rocks, and short drives. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories.\n\nThe mailboxes are not like other suburbs. They are all in one place, not in front of each house.  You need a key to open your mailbox. There are also big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. It is both suburb and country. There are pools and paths to walk on. You can exercise without going to a park.\n\nThe area has many older people. It is safe, and people look out for each other. There are also some middle-aged and young people. The city is big but feels small. It has most stores you need. There is one mall. It is not big, but it has what you need. It takes about fifteen minutes to drive to the mall.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. It has good things like pools and paths.  It is not near many stores, but you can drive to any store you want.",
            "I live in a small town. It is near a big city. My home is in a part of town where people have little money. Most houses are old, and many are rented. But it is a nice place to live. My neighbors are kind. They say hello when they see me. There is some crime here, but not much. A few years ago there were some shootings near my house. One person died. Luckily, my family has not been hurt.\n\nOur town has a big problem with drugs. Many people have died from taking too much medicine. There are places that can help people stop using drugs. There are also classes for people who know someone with a drug problem.\n\nMy son goes to a good school. The teachers and staff are great. My son has a disability, but no one has been mean to him. The school is a happy place. \n\nThe town has many things to do. The city workers have fixed the roads and parks. Most of these improvements are in the part of town where stores are. My part of town needs more help.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly. The schools are good. We can buy what we need. Our house is not big or expensive, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for many years and like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill with old buildings. I live in a tall apartment building. It is across from a old theater. Near my home is a small bar that people like to visit in the summer. Many people wait in line to go there. Not far away is a big park. People live in tents in the park during the winter. It rains a lot in winter. The tents keep them warm. They are near a place where they can shower.\n\nI love my city. It has old buildings and a beautiful view of the ocean. But I love the people most.\n\nMy neighborhood was once known for gangs. People still talk about the police who tried to stop the gangs. The people work hard to keep their neighborhood safe. They care about their city. Some people say that white people should not walk alone at night. I think this is wrong. Maybe I look different, or maybe the people see me as one of them. \n\nI see racism and fear in my city. But I also see kindness. People help each other. They offer me a jacket when I am cold. They let me charge my phone. They give me money when I am sad.\n\nNo matter where I go, my neighborhood is always home.",
            "I live in a small town in rural Michigan. It is a place where farmlands meet small tourist areas. There are no big city stores, like malls, Wal-Mart, or Applebee's. If you need to go somewhere, you have to drive. But, I live in a very beautiful place surrounded by water. My town is surrounded by Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You can find a beach to swim in almost everywhere.  \n\nMy neighborhood shows what small towns are like. The houses are spread out, not close together. They are old houses, some updated, some not. Most have full basements. Many houses have old aluminum siding. The houses are all different colors. Most have yards with swings, slides, and sometimes gardens or fences for animals.\n\nThe people here work hard, raise families, or have raised families. You see kids playing outside, people walking dogs, and neighbors biking and rollerblading. Everyone knows each other. If you see someone, you wave or smile.\n\nThe lawns are well-kept. No leaves are piled up. The grass is mowed. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It's not a neighborhood that looks fancy, but it feels like a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe.\n\nThere is a sheriff's department and jail, a health department, and a recycling center nearby. We have baseball and softball fields, and a small airport.  You can hear the planes taking off and landing. There is a local ice cream shop you can walk to. You can also walk to downtown. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a very nice place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My area is interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some homes are split in two, still joined. My house has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the side. It is like the others, showing a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream seemed good for everyone, but it feels different now.  Still, my area and others like it say the dream is still here. People are still trying to hold onto it. People are not as happy as they were. Yards are not as neat. But there are cars in every driveway. Kids still play like the world is all around them. The public school is almost ninety years old. It is still there. It makes the kids think about the future and reminds older people of the past. There are not many churches, mostly empty. But the basketball courts are full. The houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big store called Super \"A\". It is owned by a big family from Yemen. They are probably the only Arab family in the area. Most people are African American. The streets are wide and kids play football. They stop only for cars. Most people in my area have lived here for a long time. They can tell stories about when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but kids stopped going when Hollywood stopped making karate movies. Now it is a pharmacy. Drugs are good, I have heard. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies for less money. Young people do not go because they want new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap. There is one highway that goes through our town. The entrances and exits are in the next town.  There was a plan to make exits for our town, but the young people wanted it, and the older people said no. They said the highway would ruin the town. They told the city council to say no. They are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be good.",

It is hidden.\n\nApartment buildings stand close together. They look like Russian nesting dolls, placed side by side. Some buildings are bad. We will not talk about them. But the next buildings are very different. A small college is nearby. Students go there. They drink coffee and go to class. Cars drive by and get angry at the students.\n\nThe road goes to another street. A park is on one side, and a place to heal broken bones is on the other. People sit on the porch with fans. Children play in the park. Old people walk dogs and watch the young people. \n\nThere are stores near the park. A place to eat sushi, a place for swimming supplies, and a place for nails. You can eat, buy things, and get a manicure, all in one place. \n\nThere is also a place for frozen yogurt. The young people eat it and ride skateboards. This area is like a picture from the past.",
            "She asked, \"Where is everything?\" We drove past the corn fields. The fields went on and on. I knew she would be surprised. She was from a town where you could walk to the store. She had never seen so much open space.  I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she understood me better. \n\nWe drove down a small road.  You will see a lake. Just past the lake is my home. My neighborhood has small houses made of brick and stucco. Each house has a lot of land. People take pride in keeping their yards nice. In the spring, there are many flowers. The trees change color with each season.  The driveways have expensive cars. They shine in the sun after a wash.\n\nMy neighbor, who is Korean, lives near my house. He is always outside. He mows his lawn all day. You can hear him singing. Everyone laughs at him, but he is a kind man. He was a doctor before. Now he works with his lawn mower. It looks like a big green tractor.\n\nMy house is gray.  There are geese in my side yard. My dog chases them. There is a small stream behind my house. You can hear frogs, the water, and cows in the distance.\n\nAcross a bridge is a special place.

            "Portland, Oregon has a special kind of strange. People say \"Keep Portland Weird,\" this is on a building that sells pizza and serves drinks. It also plays music and lets people dance. The slogan shows people want to keep Portland different. Some people think it means remembering the old Portland, when it was less famous. It was a place for creative people. Others think it means come to Portland and be different. You will be accepted.\n\nPortland is still weird, even with new people moving here. Many people from California have moved to Portland to live. They build new houses for people to live in. But Portland is still unique.\n\n\"Weird\" does not mean everyone is always nice. It means accepting things that are not normal. Portland has many things like other cities. People buy things made in China. There are many ways to be unique. Portland has people who do yoga, people who like fashion, and people who work in offices. Maybe weird means people in Portland do not take things so seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, houses are brightly colored. People grow flowers, herbs, and vegetables in their gardens. In the summer, there are boxes on the sidewalk. People put things they do not want in these boxes. They can be clothes, books, or anything. It is like a surprise gift.\n\nWalking around my neighborhood is fun. There are many different kinds of people in Portland. Some people like yoga with goats, some people like soccer. People in Portland like many things.\n\nPortland has problems like drug use and homelessness. These problems are caused by mental health issues. The rain and cloudy weather might make these problems worse. Portland tries to help people who do not have homes, but there are not enough services.\n\nSome people in Portland are kind to homeless people, others are not. This is not unique to Portland.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun each morning and each evening. No matter if I forget them or am busy, they are there. They are strong and do not change. When I am stressed, I look at them. They help me feel better. I first came here for school. The mountains north of the school are beautiful. The school is pretty too, with its buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are the best. The town is nice too. There are many cafes where I studied. You can walk or take the bus to the center of town. The old buildings look like they are from a long time ago. The town is busy like a big city. \n\nBut if you walk past the library, you are back in a small town. The town has two different feels that are close together. This makes it special. I have many memories here. \n\nI walk past the old swings in the park with my friends. We go to the movies in the fancy theater. But there are sad memories too. The ponds are good for thinking and crying. I spend time watching turtles and ducks. I think about my life. I walk past the pond and the park and the houses. Then I see the sun shining on the palm trees. I am walking north. The mountains are there. They are strong and tall. They make me feel like I can do anything.",
            "If you go to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transit is good. It is a popular way to travel in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban area. You will feel like you are still in New York City.\n\nDuring your visit, see the many Asian stores. Many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst in the last twenty years. You will see an Asian store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundry shops are popular.\n\nThese stores are good for local people. Food is good, prices are low, and it is very convenient. There are four Asian supermarkets near me. They are all within two minutes of each other. This is very helpful for getting food.\n\nBensonhurst has people from many places. There are immigrants and their children. Many big businesses are owned by Asian people.\n\nThere is also a new park. It has ten basketball courts, a big field, handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain.\n\nThe park is diverse. People of all kinds play there. There are not many big buildings in Bensonhurst. The buildings are for apartments or homes. Most people live in two-family houses.\n\nMost people are nice, but it can be noisy. Cars play loud music and drive fast.\n\nIf you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurst is safe, but people can be mean. You may meet people who want to fight or steal. I was bullied here many years ago. Recently, there have been reports of stolen packages.\n\nPeople do not always clean up after their dogs, even though there is a fine for doing so.\n\nYou will see dog waste on the streets. Look out for it!",
            "My house is at the top of a big hill. People call it the \"work out hill\" because runners like to run up it. There are no sidewalks, so people walk on the road. The road is bad in some places. Some wires are old and broken. It rains a lot, so the wires are often fixed. There are many tall trees. People want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are high up to see the ocean. The sunset is beautiful. The water is lit up, and the sky is orange. It is often cloudy, so the sun is not always bright. It is often wet.\n\nThere are not many children. There are many old people. People have dogs. They run in the yards. Be careful, they might go into your house! Rabbits live here, too. Gardens do not like them. My cats catch them. We have birds, too. Sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles. \n\nThere are no stores near my house. If you walk down to the water, there are some restaurants. The beach is small. The rocks are fun to throw in the water. The bay is not wide. You can see the other side.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My home is in a quiet area. It is near two big roads. We see many cars each day. I know most of the people who live near me. They do normal things like work in their yards. In winter, we use a hill to sled. We live at the beginning of our street. We see many cars every day. We remember new cars. Some people walk for exercise. Children ride bikes. My family is home often. There are four of us: me, my wife, and our two daughters. They are eleven and fourteen years old. People know us well. We play outside, even in the rain. We often cook outside. It smells good. Many people cut grass. You can hear the sound of mowers from March until October. \n\nWe have many trees. They make shade. In fall, there are many leaves. We rake and burn them. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. This year, we have not had much cold weather.\n\nOur garage is behind our house. We use the front door only when someone visits. I work in the garage on my truck. When the doors are open, I feel closer to my neighborhood. Our street is quiet on holidays. On Thanksgiving, people visit from other places. There are many cars. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. It would be better if it was not a busy road.",
            "My area is in the center of the high desert. There is a lot of dirt. People who have not lived here may not understand. The color is always brown. If you see a green lawn, it means someone spends a lot of money on it.\n\nWhen I first lived here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses, but they are still spread out. It looks more like a city now, but many places are changing.\n\nMost people are friendly. Like any place, there are good parts and bad parts. I live in a nice area with many friendly older people. \n\nThe stores are big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For smaller stores, you have to travel. I do not see many Whole Foods or similar stores.\n\nI think many people work in construction. The city is not very built up, so there is still a lot of space to build. I like it the way it is. I moved from a big city and do not want to go back.\n\nI work in construction as a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nI like the animals here. People come to the desert for many reasons. One reason is the beauty. The desert has tough environments that need protection. These environments are home to many types of animals. People who live here should learn about these animals to live together safely.\n\nMy family and I get along well with the animals. My three children love lizards and desert bugs.\n\nVictorville has some things to see. It is a good place for families to experience the desert.\n\nThe San Bernardino County Fair is held here every year. It is a fun event.\n\nYou can visit Wrightwood nearby to see snowy mountains.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum has rocks, bones, Native American objects, and things that show the history of Victorville.",
            "My neighborhood is a little different. I live on a college campus. The people in my dorm are my neighbors.  The campus is also my neighborhood, but not as close as my dorm. My neighborhood has houses, people, stores, and parks, just like other neighborhoods.\n\nFirst, there are three types of houses: apartments, regular houses, and dorm houses. Apartments have 2 to 4 people per room, and there are 4 to 6 rooms per floor. Most apartments have two floors, so about 20 people live in each building.\n\nRegular houses are for rent by anyone connected to the school. They have 2 to 4 bedrooms and mostly alumni live there. There are not many of these houses. Dorm houses are for students. Hundreds of students live in these houses. Two students share a room, except for a few cases. \n\nMy school has many different people. There are people from many cultures and ages. Staff members live in the regular houses. Newer students live in dorms, and older students live in apartments. \n\nThe campus has many stores. There are places to eat, and stores that sell school clothes and food. You can find almost anything you need on campus. \n\nThere is one park on campus. Everyone in the neighborhood uses it. It is clean and safe.",
            "I have lived here for ten years. When I first came to Stockbridge from Riverdale, I was sad. I missed my old home and friends. My parents wanted a better life for me and my sister, so we moved. We got a new house, a good high school, and a safer place to live.\n\nAt first, I made new friends and some new enemies at school. I did not get to know many neighbors except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis for a little while. They are good people, like family to me.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family. It was fun! I caught a piece of his wife’s dress when she threw it. I hope his wife, Ms. Veda, is happy. I enjoyed dancing with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I hope she is doing well.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to explore it. I have been to the park with my friends, Kason and Curtis. We played video games and had fun.\n\nThe park is peaceful. I like to go there to relax. I also practice my balance with sticks from the hardware store and sometimes bring my wooden sword. There is a basketball and tennis court, but I haven’t played in a long time.\n\nMy dad taught me and my best friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a great time. We worked hard, but we always had fun.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. I look forward to more happy memories in the future.",
            "My home is near my school. I like living there. There are many apartment buildings. There are also a few restaurants and bars. They are not very expensive. One bar just changed names. It is more expensive, but the drinks are good. Most people are nice. They are students or have low incomes. The rent is low. There are many children near my home. There is a school close by. I do not know my neighbors. I do not want to. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The building managers put air freshener near their door. It is funny. The buildings are old, but may have new insides. Down the street are new apartments. I do not like them. They are not built well, but the rent is high. The buildings are near the school, so the managers can charge more. There is a cheap restaurant nearby. They serve food on paper plates. Most food is warmed up in the microwave. Across the street is a gas station. People say it is a bad place to work. The city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a good sidewalk, grass, and the area is nicer. My building has many trees. They cut down some trees, but there are many left. Behind my building is a line of trees, then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind me is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad. The buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. Maybe they hide the buildings. Most crime in the area has happened at an apartment complex on this street. But I cannot blame them alone. There are other apartments across the street with crime and many people moving in and out. I like where I live. It is affordable and there are many things nearby. I like that the university is walkable and there are two bus stops. I can go to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My area has small houses. They are close together, but they look like they are far apart. All the houses are yellow with white front porches and green roofs. Almost everyone knows each other. We talk in the evenings. The small children play outside. It is nice to be in a place that is not filled with computers and machines. It feels like we are back in time. \n\nWe live near fields and trees. The sky is blue. There are white clouds in the sky. The bad thing is that we have storms. Last week, we had a warning about a tornado. We heard the sirens and went to a safe place.\n\nMy small dog went with me. My big dog stayed in the living room and was scared. We heard big hail fall on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot. The hail melted quickly.\n\nAfter the storm, a rainbow appeared. I took pictures to share with my friends. Then, people came home. Everything was normal again.\n\nI live in a two-bedroom apartment. Everyone else in the area lives in the same kind of apartment. The inside of the apartments are different. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my apartment. There is a pond there. I have seen deer. I hear a big frog sing in the morning.\n\nIt is a good place to live. It is close to the city. I hear roosters crow in the morning. It feels like a small village. We even have a donkey that makes noise in the evening. I am happy that I found this place.",
            "I lived in this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. I made friends with two boys. One lived two houses down. The other lived on my street.  They do not live here anymore, but I remember them. \n\nThe people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like other American neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses. On warm days, I hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had any problems with neighbors. People leave each other alone unless they need help.\n\nI have ordered things online and never had a package taken. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball there. I also got hurt there once playing football. But the good memories are better. Now, I go to the park with my cousins' children. They are young and like the swings and slides. Just thinking about the park makes them happy. The park makes me feel nostalgic.\n\nMy neighborhood is diverse. There are many kinds of food. Close by, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Some people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food. Fast food is popular, but you can find it anywhere. There are many pizza places too.\n\nThe stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There is even an Indian store. Overall, I like my neighborhood. Seeing bad things happen to people in other neighborhoods makes me thankful for mine.",
            "My town is small. It is in South Carolina. It is not special. But it has many peach farms. People call it the Peach Capital of the World. Most of the town is farm land. There are peach trees and cows.\n\nThe houses are far apart. Many are two stories. They have metal roofs or gray shingles. The houses are not near the road. They are back in the fields. There is one stop light in town. It is at a four way.\n\nThere are three places to buy fast food. There is a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, and a burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small drug store. It is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There is one grocery store, but people often go to a bigger store in another town. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things.\n\nThere is a small furniture store. It has been in town for a long time. There is a pet groomer next door. There is a doctor and a vet. They are small but good. There is one elementary school. Students go to school in another town for middle and high school.\n\nThere are no parks in town, but they are making one. There are not many things to do in town. There are no movies, bowling, or playgrounds. It is a quiet town.",
            "I first heard of my home when I listened to a podcast about missing people. It was a little strange. Most apartments here cost over a thousand dollars each month. I had not heard that story, and neither had my friends. Maybe it is the hard times. I know some friends cry at night. Things are expensive, but we have learned to save money. You learn to like old toys from the market and clothes that have been kept in storage. You do not smell as much when you are older. You might smoke, or you might just get used to things. But the market is always there. The smell of being an adult is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in your clothes even after you wash them. \n\nThere are three secondhand stores near here. If you start on one side, you can go to two charity stores, a library, a store for old books, and a shop with strange things. The city center is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you cannot hear it in the stores. It does not matter how many cars or people go by, the stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, there are more people and cars. It is a growing city, they say. It has one of the biggest online stores for buying and selling things. It is still growing and changing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is working on their own goals, and no one asks much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It is not like the South, where if you show a little concern, people think you care. No one asks about your life here. You can keep to yourself as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like waves on the beach. It is a lively place.\n\nBetween the piano player next door and the two people who sing upstairs, there is always something happening. In a way, we have less of an apartment building full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn deaths, and help each other when we can. In a way, I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same. I bring them mail, and they bring me mail. It is nice to see them, and I think they like me being here. I live in a big, impersonal city, but it is people like my neighbors that make me feel like I did not ruin my life.",
            "My area is a suburb. It is like many other suburbs. There is a group that looks after the houses. They make sure all the houses are the same.  There are small front yards with grass, rocks, and short drives. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories.\n\nThe mailboxes are not like other suburbs. They are all in one place, not in front of each house.  You need a key to open your mailbox. There are also big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. It is both suburb and country. There are pools and paths to walk on. You can exercise without going to a park.\n\nThe area has many older people. It is safe, and people look out for each other. There are also some middle-aged and young people. The city is big but feels small. It has most stores you need. There is one mall. It is not big, but it has what you need. It takes about fifteen minutes to drive to the mall.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. It has good things like pools and paths.  It is not near many stores, but you can drive to any store you want.",
            "I live in a small town. It is near a big city. My home is in a part of town where people have little money. Most houses are old, and many are rented. But it is a nice place to live. My neighbors are kind. They say hello when they see me. There is some crime here, but not much. A few years ago there were some shootings near my house. One person died. Luckily, my family has not been hurt.\n\nOur town has a big problem with drugs. Many people have died from taking too much medicine. There are places that can help people stop using drugs. There are also classes for people who know someone with a drug problem.\n\nMy son goes to a good school. The teachers and staff are great. My son has a disability, but no one has been mean to him. The school is a happy place. \n\nThe town has many things to do. The city workers have fixed the roads and parks. Most of these improvements are in the part of town where stores are. My part of town needs more help.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly. The schools are good. We can buy what we need. Our house is not big or expensive, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for many years and like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill with old buildings. I live in a tall apartment building. It is across from a old theater. Near my home is a small bar that people like to visit in the summer. Many people wait in line to go there. Not far away is a big park. People live in tents in the park during the winter. It rains a lot in winter. The tents keep them warm. They are near a place where they can shower.\n\nI love my city. It has old buildings and a beautiful view of the ocean. But I love the people most.\n\nMy neighborhood was once known for gangs. People still talk about the police who tried to stop the gangs. The people work hard to keep their neighborhood safe. They care about their city. Some people say that white people should not walk alone at night. I think this is wrong. Maybe I look different, or maybe the people see me as one of them. \n\nI see racism and fear in my city. But I also see kindness. People help each other. They offer me a jacket when I am cold. They let me charge my phone. They give me money when I am sad.\n\nNo matter where I go, my neighborhood is always home.",
            "I live in a small town in rural Michigan. It is a place where farmlands meet small tourist areas. There are no big city stores, like malls, Wal-Mart, or Applebee's. If you need to go somewhere, you have to drive. But, I live in a very beautiful place surrounded by water. My town is surrounded by Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You can find a beach to swim in almost everywhere.  \n\nMy neighborhood shows what small towns are like. The houses are spread out, not close together. They are old houses, some updated, some not. Most have full basements. Many houses have old aluminum siding. The houses are all different colors. Most have yards with swings, slides, and sometimes gardens or fences for animals.\n\nThe people here work hard, raise families, or have raised families. You see kids playing outside, people walking dogs, and neighbors biking and rollerblading. Everyone knows each other. If you see someone, you wave or smile.\n\nThe lawns are well-kept. No leaves are piled up. The grass is mowed. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It's not a neighborhood that looks fancy, but it feels like a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe.\n\nThere is a sheriff's department and jail, a health department, and a recycling center nearby. We have baseball and softball fields, and a small airport.  You can hear the planes taking off and landing. There is a local ice cream shop you can walk to. You can also walk to downtown. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a very nice place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

            "My area is interesting. Most houses are for one family. But some homes are split in two, still joined. My house has a small yard in front and a small driveway on the side. It is like the others, showing a time when living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream seemed good for everyone, but it feels different now.  Still, my area and others like it say the dream is still here. People are still trying to hold onto it. People are not as happy as they were. Yards are not as neat. But there are cars in every driveway. Kids still play like the world is all around them. The public school is almost ninety years old. It is still there. It makes the kids think about the future and reminds older people of the past. There are not many churches, mostly empty. But the basketball courts are full. The houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big store called Super \"A\". It is owned by a big family from Yemen. They are probably the only Arab family in the area. Most people are African American. The streets are wide and kids play football. They stop only for cars. Most people in my area have lived here for a long time. They can tell stories about when everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but kids stopped going when Hollywood stopped making karate movies. Now it is a pharmacy. Drugs are good, I have heard. There is a small movie theater that shows old movies for less money. Young people do not go because they want new movies. Older people like it because it is cheap. There is one highway that goes through our town. The entrances and exits are in the next town.  There was a plan to make exits for our town, but the young people wanted it, and the older people said no. They said the highway would ruin the town. They told the city council to say no. They are building a new high school. We are trying to choose a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be good.",

It is hidden.\n\nApartment buildings stand close together. They look like Russian nesting dolls, placed side by side. Some buildings are bad. We will not talk about them. But the next buildings are very different. A small college is nearby. Students go there. They drink coffee and go to class. Cars drive by and get angry at the students.\n\nThe road goes to another street. A park is on one side, and a place to heal broken bones is on the other. People sit on the porch with fans. Children play in the park. Old people walk dogs and watch the young people. \n\nThere are stores near the park. A place to eat sushi, a place for swimming supplies, and a place for nails. You can eat, buy things, and get a manicure, all in one place. \n\nThere is also a place for frozen yogurt. The young people eat it and ride skateboards. This area is like a picture from the past.",
            "She asked, \"Where is everything?\" We drove past the corn fields. The fields went on and on. I knew she would be surprised. She was from a town where you could walk to the store. She had never seen so much open space.  I told her about growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she understood me better. \n\nWe drove down a small road.  You will see a lake. Just past the lake is my home. My neighborhood has small houses made of brick and stucco. Each house has a lot of land. People take pride in keeping their yards nice. In the spring, there are many flowers. The trees change color with each season.  The driveways have expensive cars. They shine in the sun after a wash.\n\nMy neighbor, who is Korean, lives near my house. He is always outside. He mows his lawn all day. You can hear him singing. Everyone laughs at him, but he is a kind man. He was a doctor before. Now he works with his lawn mower. It looks like a big green tractor.\n\nMy house is gray.  There are geese in my side yard. My dog chases them. There is a small stream behind my house. You can hear frogs, the water, and cows in the distance.\n\nAcross a bridge is a special place. There are trees, plants, and flowers growing there. I played there when I was a child. I built forts and played games. \n\nWinter is hard here, but it is beautiful. The yard turns brown.

            "Portland, Oregon has a special kind of strange. People say \"Keep Portland Weird,\" this is on a building that sells pizza and serves drinks. It also plays music and lets people dance. The slogan shows people want to keep Portland different. Some people think it means remembering the old Portland, when it was less famous. It was a place for creative people. Others think it means come to Portland and be different. You will be accepted.\n\nPortland is still weird, even with new people moving here. Many people from California have moved to Portland to live. They build new houses for people to live in. But Portland is still unique.\n\n\"Weird\" does not mean everyone is always nice. It means accepting things that are not normal. Portland has many things like other cities. People buy things made in China. There are many ways to be unique. Portland has people who do yoga, people who like fashion, and people who work in offices. Maybe weird means people in Portland do not take things so seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, houses are brightly colored. People grow flowers, herbs, and vegetables in their gardens. In the summer, there are boxes on the sidewalk. People put things they do not want in these boxes. They can be clothes, books, or anything. It is like a surprise gift.\n\nWalking around my neighborhood is fun. There are many different kinds of people in Portland. Some people like yoga with goats, some people like soccer. People in Portland like many things.\n\nPortland has problems like drug use and homelessness. These problems are caused by mental health issues. The rain and cloudy weather might make these problems worse. Portland tries to help people who do not have homes, but there are not enough services.\n\nSome people in Portland are kind to homeless people, others are not. This is not unique to Portland.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun each morning and each evening. No matter if I forget them or am busy, they are there. They are strong and do not change. When I am stressed, I look at them. They help me feel better. I first came here for school. The mountains north of the school are beautiful. The school is pretty too, with its buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are the best. The town is nice too. There are many cafes where I studied. You can walk or take the bus to the center of town. The old buildings look like they are from a long time ago. The town is busy like a big city. \n\nBut if you walk past the library, you are back in a small town. The town has two different feels that are close together. This makes it special. I have many memories here. \n\nI walk past the old swings in the park with my friends. We go to the movies in the fancy theater. But there are sad memories too. The ponds are good for thinking and crying. I spend time watching turtles and ducks. I think about my life. I walk past the pond and the park and the houses. Then I see the sun shining on the palm trees. I am walking north. The mountains are there. They are strong and tall. They make me feel like I can do anything.",
            "If you go to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transit is good. It is a popular way to travel in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban area. You will feel like you are still in New York City.\n\nDuring your visit, see the many Asian stores. Many Asian people have moved to Bensonhurst in the last twenty years. You will see an Asian store on almost every block. Supermarkets and laundry shops are popular.\n\nThese stores are good for local people. Food is good, prices are low, and it is very convenient. There are four Asian supermarkets near me. They are all within two minutes of each other. This is very helpful for getting food.\n\nBensonhurst has people from many places. There are immigrants and their children. Many big businesses are owned by Asian people.\n\nThere is also a new park. It has ten basketball courts, a big field, handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain.\n\nThe park is diverse. People of all kinds play there. There are not many big buildings in Bensonhurst. The buildings are for apartments or homes. Most people live in two-family houses.\n\nMost people are nice, but it can be noisy. Cars play loud music and drive fast.\n\nIf you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurst is safe, but people can be mean. You may meet people who want to fight or steal. I was bullied here many years ago. Recently, there have been reports of stolen packages.\n\nPeople do not always clean up after their dogs, even though there is a fine for doing so.\n\nYou will see dog waste on the streets. Look out for it!",
            "My house is at the top of a big hill. People call it the \"work out hill\" because runners like to run up it. There are no sidewalks, so people walk on the road. The road is bad in some places. Some wires are old and broken. It rains a lot, so the wires are often fixed. There are many tall trees. People want to cut them down because they block the view of the ocean. Many houses are high up to see the ocean. The sunset is beautiful. The water is lit up, and the sky is orange. It is often cloudy, so the sun is not always bright. It is often wet.\n\nThere are not many children. There are many old people. People have dogs. They run in the yards. Be careful, they might go into your house! Rabbits live here, too. Gardens do not like them. My cats catch them. We have birds, too. Sparrows, hummingbirds, and sometimes hawks or eagles. \n\nThere are no stores near my house. If you walk down to the water, there are some restaurants. The beach is small. The rocks are fun to throw in the water. The bay is not wide. You can see the other side.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My home is in a quiet area. It is near two big roads. We see many cars each day. I know most of the people who live near me. They do normal things like work in their yards. In winter, we use a hill to sled. We live at the beginning of our street. We see many cars every day. We remember new cars. Some people walk for exercise. Children ride bikes. My family is home often. There are four of us: me, my wife, and our two daughters. They are eleven and fourteen years old. People know us well. We play outside, even in the rain. We often cook outside. It smells good. Many people cut grass. You can hear the sound of mowers from March until October. \n\nWe have many trees. They make shade. In fall, there are many leaves. We rake and burn them. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. This year, we have not had much cold weather.\n\nOur garage is behind our house. We use the front door only when someone visits. I work in the garage on my truck. When the doors are open, I feel closer to my neighborhood. Our street is quiet on holidays. On Thanksgiving, people visit from other places. There are many cars. It is the same on Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. It would be better if it was not a busy road.",
            "My area is in the center of the high desert. There is a lot of dirt. People who have not lived here may not understand. The color is always brown. If you see a green lawn, it means someone spends a lot of money on it.\n\nWhen I first lived here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses, but they are still spread out. It looks more like a city now, but many places are changing.\n\nMost people are friendly. Like any place, there are good parts and bad parts. I live in a nice area with many friendly older people. \n\nThe stores are big chains like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For smaller stores, you have to travel. I do not see many Whole Foods or similar stores.\n\nI think many people work in construction. The city is not very built up, so there is still a lot of space to build. I like it the way it is. I moved from a big city and do not want to go back.\n\nI work in construction as a drywall and T-bar installer.\n\nI like the animals here. People come to the desert for many reasons. One reason is the beauty. The desert has tough environments that need protection. These environments are home to many types of animals. People who live here should learn about these animals to live together safely.\n\nMy family and I get along well with the animals. My three children love lizards and desert bugs.\n\nVictorville has some things to see. It is a good place for families to experience the desert.\n\nThe San Bernardino County Fair is held here every year. It is a fun event.\n\nYou can visit Wrightwood nearby to see snowy mountains.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum has rocks, bones, Native American objects, and things that show the history of Victorville.",
            "My neighborhood is a little different. I live on a college campus. The people in my dorm are my neighbors.  The campus is also my neighborhood, but not as close as my dorm. My neighborhood has houses, people, stores, and parks, just like other neighborhoods.\n\nFirst, there are three types of houses: apartments, regular houses, and dorm houses. Apartments have 2 to 4 people per room, and there are 4 to 6 rooms per floor. Most apartments have two floors, so about 20 people live in each building.\n\nRegular houses are for rent by anyone connected to the school. They have 2 to 4 bedrooms and mostly alumni live there. There are not many of these houses. Dorm houses are for students. Hundreds of students live in these houses. Two students share a room, except for a few cases. \n\nMy school has many different people. There are people from many cultures and ages. Staff members live in the regular houses. Newer students live in dorms, and older students live in apartments. \n\nThe campus has many stores. There are places to eat, and stores that sell school clothes and food. You can find almost anything you need on campus. \n\nThere is one park on campus. Everyone in the neighborhood uses it. It is clean and safe.",
            "I have lived here for ten years. When I first came to Stockbridge from Riverdale, I was sad. I missed my old home and friends. My parents wanted a better life for me and my sister, so we moved. We got a new house, a good high school, and a safer place to live.\n\nAt first, I made new friends and some new enemies at school. I did not get to know many neighbors except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis for a little while. They are good people, like family to me.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen’s wedding with my family. It was fun! I caught a piece of his wife’s dress when she threw it. I hope his wife, Ms. Veda, is happy. I enjoyed dancing with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I hope she is doing well.\n\nMy neighborhood is like a maze. I use a GPS to explore it. I have been to the park with my friends, Kason and Curtis. We played video games and had fun.\n\nThe park is peaceful. I like to go there to relax. I also practice my balance with sticks from the hardware store and sometimes bring my wooden sword. There is a basketball and tennis court, but I haven’t played in a long time.\n\nMy dad taught me and my best friend how to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a great time. We worked hard, but we always had fun.\n\nI have had many good times in this neighborhood. I look forward to more happy memories in the future.",
            "My home is near my school. I like living there. There are many apartment buildings. There are also a few restaurants and bars. They are not very expensive. One bar just changed names. It is more expensive, but the drinks are good. Most people are nice. They are students or have low incomes. The rent is low. There are many children near my home. There is a school close by. I do not know my neighbors. I do not want to. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The building managers put air freshener near their door. It is funny. The buildings are old, but may have new insides. Down the street are new apartments. I do not like them. They are not built well, but the rent is high. The buildings are near the school, so the managers can charge more. There is a cheap restaurant nearby. They serve food on paper plates. Most food is warmed up in the microwave. Across the street is a gas station. People say it is a bad place to work. The city fixed the road last summer. Now there is a good sidewalk, grass, and the area is nicer. My building has many trees. They cut down some trees, but there are many left. Behind my building is a line of trees, then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street. Behind me is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad. The buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. Maybe they hide the buildings. Most crime in the area has happened at an apartment complex on this street. But I cannot blame them alone. There are other apartments across the street with crime and many people moving in and out. I like where I live. It is affordable and there are many things nearby. I like that the university is walkable and there are two bus stops. I can go to the store and downtown easily.",
            "My area has small houses. They are close together, but they look like they are far apart. All the houses are yellow with white front porches and green roofs. Almost everyone knows each other. We talk in the evenings. The small children play outside. It is nice to be in a place that is not filled with computers and machines. It feels like we are back in time. \n\nWe live near fields and trees. The sky is blue. There are white clouds in the sky. The bad thing is that we have storms. Last week, we had a warning about a tornado. We heard the sirens and went to a safe place.\n\nMy small dog went with me. My big dog stayed in the living room and was scared. We heard big hail fall on the ground. After the storm, the road was hot. The hail melted quickly.\n\nAfter the storm, a rainbow appeared. I took pictures to share with my friends. Then, people came home. Everything was normal again.\n\nI live in a two-bedroom apartment. Everyone else in the area lives in the same kind of apartment. The inside of the apartments are different. Some are small. I like to walk in the big field behind my apartment. There is a pond there. I have seen deer. I hear a big frog sing in the morning.\n\nIt is a good place to live. It is close to the city. I hear roosters crow in the morning. It feels like a small village. We even have a donkey that makes noise in the evening. I am happy that I found this place.",
            "I lived in this neighborhood when I started eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. I made friends with two boys. One lived two houses down. The other lived on my street.  They do not live here anymore, but I remember them. \n\nThe people who lived here when I moved here are still here. My neighborhood is like other American neighborhoods. There are many two-story houses. On warm days, I hear children playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had any problems with neighbors. People leave each other alone unless they need help.\n\nI have ordered things online and never had a package taken. I trust my neighbors. There is a park near my house. I have many good memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball there. I also got hurt there once playing football. But the good memories are better. Now, I go to the park with my cousins' children. They are young and like the swings and slides. Just thinking about the park makes them happy. The park makes me feel nostalgic.\n\nMy neighborhood is diverse. There are many kinds of food. Close by, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Some people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food. Fast food is popular, but you can find it anywhere. There are many pizza places too.\n\nThe stores have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There is even an Indian store. Overall, I like my neighborhood. Seeing bad things happen to people in other neighborhoods makes me thankful for mine.",
            "My town is small. It is in South Carolina. It is not special. But it has many peach farms. People call it the Peach Capital of the World. Most of the town is farm land. There are peach trees and cows.\n\nThe houses are far apart. Many are two stories. They have metal roofs or gray shingles. The houses are not near the road. They are back in the fields. There is one stop light in town. It is at a four way.\n\nThere are three places to buy fast food. There is a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, and a burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small drug store. It is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There is one grocery store, but people often go to a bigger store in another town. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things.\n\nThere is a small furniture store. It has been in town for a long time. There is a pet groomer next door. There is a doctor and a vet. They are small but good. There is one elementary school. Students go to school in another town for middle and high school.\n\nThere are no parks in town, but they are making one. There are not many things to do in town. There are no movies, bowling, or playgrounds. It is a quiet town.",
            "I first heard of my home when I listened to a podcast about missing people. It was a little strange. Most apartments here cost over a thousand dollars each month. I had not heard that story, and neither had my friends. Maybe it is the hard times. I know some friends cry at night. Things are expensive, but we have learned to save money. You learn to like old toys from the market and clothes that have been kept in storage. You do not smell as much when you are older. You might smoke, or you might just get used to things. But the market is always there. The smell of being an adult is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays in your clothes even after you wash them. \n\nThere are three secondhand stores near here. If you start on one side, you can go to two charity stores, a library, a store for old books, and a shop with strange things. The city center is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you cannot hear it in the stores. It does not matter how many cars or people go by, the stores are quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, there are more people and cars. It is a growing city, they say. It has one of the biggest online stores for buying and selling things. It is still growing and changing. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is working on their own goals, and no one asks much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It is not like the South, where if you show a little concern, people think you care. No one asks about your life here. You can keep to yourself as long as you want, and the city will keep moving like waves on the beach. It is a lively place.\n\nBetween the piano player next door and the two people who sing upstairs, there is always something happening. In a way, we have less of an apartment building full of strangers and more of a community of friends. We help each other, celebrate birthdays, mourn deaths, and help each other when we can. In a way, I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and leave them food, and they do the same. I bring them mail, and they bring me mail. It is nice to see them, and I think they like me being here. I live in a big, impersonal city, but it is people like my neighbors that make me feel like I did not ruin my life.",
            "My area is a suburb. It is like many other suburbs. There is a group that looks after the houses. They make sure all the houses are the same.  There are small front yards with grass, rocks, and short drives. Most houses are one story, but some are two stories.\n\nThe mailboxes are not like other suburbs. They are all in one place, not in front of each house.  You need a key to open your mailbox. There are also big boxes for packages.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. It is both suburb and country. There are pools and paths to walk on. You can exercise without going to a park.\n\nThe area has many older people. It is safe, and people look out for each other. There are also some middle-aged and young people. The city is big but feels small. It has most stores you need. There is one mall. It is not big, but it has what you need. It takes about fifteen minutes to drive to the mall.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. It has good things like pools and paths.  It is not near many stores, but you can drive to any store you want.",
            "I live in a small town. It is near a big city. My home is in a part of town where people have little money. Most houses are old, and many are rented. But it is a nice place to live. My neighbors are kind. They say hello when they see me. There is some crime here, but not much. A few years ago there were some shootings near my house. One person died. Luckily, my family has not been hurt.\n\nOur town has a big problem with drugs. Many people have died from taking too much medicine. There are places that can help people stop using drugs. There are also classes for people who know someone with a drug problem.\n\nMy son goes to a good school. The teachers and staff are great. My son has a disability, but no one has been mean to him. The school is a happy place. \n\nThe town has many things to do. The city workers have fixed the roads and parks. Most of these improvements are in the part of town where stores are. My part of town needs more help.\n\nI like living in this town. People are friendly. The schools are good. We can buy what we need. Our house is not big or expensive, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for many years and like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill with old buildings. I live in a tall apartment building. It is across from a old theater. Near my home is a small bar that people like to visit in the summer. Many people wait in line to go there. Not far away is a big park. People live in tents in the park during the winter. It rains a lot in winter. The tents keep them warm. They are near a place where they can shower.\n\nI love my city. It has old buildings and a beautiful view of the ocean. But I love the people most.\n\nMy neighborhood was once known for gangs. People still talk about the police who tried to stop the gangs. The people work hard to keep their neighborhood safe. They care about their city. Some people say that white people should not walk alone at night. I think this is wrong. Maybe I look different, or maybe the people see me as one of them. \n\nI see racism and fear in my city. But I also see kindness. People help each other. They offer me a jacket when I am cold. They let me charge my phone. They give me money when I am sad.\n\nNo matter where I go, my neighborhood is always home.",
            "I live in a small town in rural Michigan. It is a place where farmlands meet small tourist areas. There are no big city stores, like malls, Wal-Mart, or Applebee's. If you need to go somewhere, you have to drive. But, I live in a very beautiful place surrounded by water. My town is surrounded by Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You can find a beach to swim in almost everywhere.  \n\nMy neighborhood shows what small towns are like. The houses are spread out, not close together. They are old houses, some updated, some not. Most have full basements. Many houses have old aluminum siding. The houses are all different colors. Most have yards with swings, slides, and sometimes gardens or fences for animals.\n\nThe people here work hard, raise families, or have raised families. You see kids playing outside, people walking dogs, and neighbors biking and rollerblading. Everyone knows each other. If you see someone, you wave or smile.\n\nThe lawns are well-kept. No leaves are piled up. The grass is mowed. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It's not a neighborhood that looks fancy, but it feels like a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe.\n\nThere is a sheriff's department and jail, a health department, and a recycling center nearby. We have baseball and softball fields, and a small airport.  You can hear the planes taking off and landing. There is a local ice cream shop you can walk to. You can also walk to downtown. My kids can ride their bikes to the park, which is just a few blocks away. It is a very nice place to live."
