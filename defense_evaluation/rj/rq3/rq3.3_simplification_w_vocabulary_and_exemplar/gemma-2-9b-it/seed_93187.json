            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

Some are gay, some are Jewish, and some are from Russia. There are other areas in the city with many people from different countries. For example, there is Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia. It is hard to drive in the city. Traffic is bad. People drive a lot. There are not many sidewalks. It is hard to find a place to park. The city is building many new apartments.

It looks like houses from long ago when living in the suburbs was very popular. This dream used to make people happy.\n\nNow, fewer people think this way. But my neighborhood still shows the dream is alive. People are not as happy as before. Yards are not as nice. But there are still cars in the drives. Kids play like the world is all they know.\n\nThe old school is still here. It is almost ninety years old. It shows hope to the young and remembers the past for older people. There are not many churches, but the basketball courts are full.\n\nAll the houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big grocery store called Super \"A\". A big family from Yemen owns it. They are the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people are African American.\n\nThe streets are wide and kids play football. Cars stop for them. Many people have lived here for a long time. They know each other.\n\nThere used to be a karate school, but kids stopped going when karate movies were not popular.

It is not in our town exactly, but close.

            "This area looks small and quiet. It is behind stores, not a place people think to live. But if you walk behind the old store and old hotels, you find a busy place. There are many apartment buildings here. They are close together, like toys inside each other.\n\nThe first buildings were in the news for bad things. We will not talk about those. The next buildings are different. They are a secret, known only to a few.  Across from these buildings is a small school. Students go there with coffee in the morning. They walk slow. Drivers get mad when they are late. The road goes to another place with a park and a hospital.\n\nThe hospital helps people who are hurt. It has chairs outside and a fan that moves the hot air. Children play in the park. They run and jump. Old people walk their dogs and watch the young people. They talk about their lives.\n\nThere is a place to buy food and things for pools. People can get a meal and buy pool stuff. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Young people eat it while they ride their bikes and use special things that make smoke.\n\nThis area is a part of America. It is old and quiet. Not much changes here.",
            "\"Where is every thing?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields.  They filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the open space.  She was from a town where the store was a short walk away. She had never seen so much open land.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio.  In that moment, she understood who I am and where I come from.  \n\nWe drove down a small road. We came to a lake. A small town is just past it. The houses are made of brick and stucco.  Each house has a lot of land. People take pride in keeping it nice. In the spring, there are many flowers. The trees change color in the fall. The driveways have expensive cars. They shine in the sun after a car wash.\n\nMy neighbor is Korean. He is always outside. He mows his lawn all day. He sings while he mows. Everyone laughs at him, but he is a good person. He had a long life and has lost some of his memory. He used to be a doctor.  He likes to mow his lawn with a John Deere mower.\n\nYou will come to my house. Geese are in the side yard. Our dog chases them. There is a small stream behind the house. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and cows from the farms nearby.\n\nAcross a wooden bridge is a quiet place. There are trees, plants, and flowers.  I spent much of my childhood there. I built tree houses and chased animals. There were always friends to play with.\n\nWinter can be cold, but it is very beautiful. The yard changes from green to brown. The trees lose their leaves. When it snows, it looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot. In the winter, we used snowballs as weapons. We built forts to store our snowballs.\n\nIn our winter wonderland, we played pretend. It was a time when nothing else mattered. We were just kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon has a special way. People say it is \"weird\". The city has a sign that says \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some people like this sign because it shows a time when Portland was smaller and more different.  Others think it means Portland is a good place to be different. Even though many rich people from California move to Portland, and there are many new buildings, Portland is still weird. \n\n\"Weird\" does not mean everyone is nice to each other. But it means people accept things that are not usual. Portland has modern things like stores from China.  There are many ways to be different. But Portland also has normal things like yoga, people who like to look stylish, and people who work in offices. \n\nMaybe \"weird\" means people in Portland do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, houses have bright colors. People grow flowers, fruits, and vegetables in their yards. There are boxes outside in the summer. These boxes have things people do not want anymore. Sometimes these boxes have clothes or books. Sometimes they have something special. It is fun to see what is inside.  \n\nThis is what Portland means to me. But there are many kinds of weird people in Portland.  Some people would never take clothes from a box on the street. These people do things like yoga with goats or watch soccer games. Portland has people who like many different things.  \n\nPortland has some problems. Some people use drugs. This is often connected to mental health problems. The rain and clouds can make people feel sad.  There are also many homeless people. People in Portland want to help, but it is hard to know what to do.",

The school is pretty, with buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special. The town is also nice. There are many cafes where I studied. The center of town is old. The buildings are made of brick. It is busy there. But after a few blocks, the town is quiet again. This makes the town interesting. I have made many memories here. I have walked with friends in the park. I have seen movies in the theater. But there are sad memories too. The ponds are a good place to think. I have cried there when I felt lost. I watched the turtles and ducks. I wondered about my life. I walked past the pond, the park, and the houses. I reached a main street. The sun was shining. I saw the mountains. They were big and strong. They made me feel brave.",

I was bullied here once, but this was a long time ago.  People sometimes steal packages.\n\nPeople do not always clean up after their dogs. You might see dog waste on the sidewalk.\n\nBe careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "My house is at the top of a big hill.  People call it the “workout hill” because runners like to go up it. There are no sidewalks on my street, so people walk on the road. The road has holes and is hard to drive on. The telephone and electric wires look old and broken. It rains a lot here, so branches fall on the wires. The wires are fixed many times.\n\nThere are many tall trees around.  People do not like the trees. They want to cut them down. The trees block the view of the ocean.\n\nMany houses are built high on the hill with big windows to see the bay. The sunset is pretty. The water shines and the sky is orange. It is often cloudy. \n\nMoss grows on everything.  My car turned green after I left it in the driveway for a month.\n\nThere are not many children here. There is a school nearby, but most people are old. People have dogs. They sit in yards or run down the street. Dogs sometimes go into houses.\n\nRabbits are everywhere. Gardeners do not like them because they dig in the ground. My cats like to hunt rabbits. We also see birds: small birds, hummingbirds, hawks, and eagles.  \n\nThere are no stores near my house. If you go down to the water, there are some restaurants. You can eat seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not wide. You can see the other side.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street that connects two big roads. There are many cars on the street. \n\nMy neighborhood is quiet. Most people have lived here a long time. They take care of their yards and do normal things. In the winter, we go sledding down a small hill. Our house is at the corner. We see everyone driving by. \n\nWe know most of the cars. If we see a car we do not know, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise. Kids ride their bikes. It is normal. My wife and I work from home. We have two daughters, eleven and fourteen years old. We are home a lot. We play outside, even in the rain.\n\nWe often grill on our back deck. The smell is good. Many neighbors cut grass. We hear lawnmowers often from spring until fall. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was a forest before houses were built. There are many leaves in the fall. We rake and burn them. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has arrived.\n\nWe have not had much winter lately. It just feels like fall. Our garage is in the back. We do not use our front door much. I like to work in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.\n\nHolidays are quiet. Thanksgiving is busy. Many families visit. There are many cars. It is the same for Mother's Day and Christmas.\n\nI like living here. If it were not a busy street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the center of the high desert. There is much dirt. People who have not lived here do not know how it feels to see only brown. If you see a green lawn, you know that person spends a lot of money on it. When I first lived here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. It looks more like a city each day. Most places are changing this way. Most people here are friendly. Like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. My neighborhood has many friendly older people. This makes it a good place to live. The stores are big chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want good food, you must travel. I do not see many Whole Foods stores here. Most jobs in this city are in construction. I think this is because the city is still growing. There is much empty space. This makes me worried. I like things as they are. I left a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bar. I like the animals in my home. People come to the high desert for many reasons. One reason is the beautiful desert. The desert climate and land have made special places that need protection. These places are home to many animals. People should learn about the animals to live together safely. My family and I live well with the animals. My three children love lizards and desert bugs.\n\nVictorville has some attractions. It is good for families to experience the desert. They can have a different experience. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair is fun for everyone. Visit Wrightwood nearby to see the snow-covered mountains. You can learn winter sports there.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum has interesting things to see. There are rocks, old things, and objects from Native American people. These things show the history of Victorville.",
            "My neighbor hood is different. I live on a college campus. My friends in the dorms are my neighbors. The campus is also my neighbor hood. It is like other neighbor hoods. It has houses, people, stores, and a park. \n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds: apartments, regular houses, and dorm rooms. Apartments have 2 to 4 people per room. There are 4 to 6 rooms per floor. Most apartments have 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each building. \n\nThe regular houses are for rent. They have 2 to 4 bedrooms. Mostly older students live there. Dorm rooms are for students. Two students share a room. \n\nMy school has many different kinds of people. Students, teachers, and staff live here. Older students live in apartments, newer students live in dorms, and staff live in the regular houses. \n\nThere are many stores on campus. There are restaurants, shops, and grocery stores. You can get anything you need on campus. There is also a park. Everyone uses the park. It is safe and clean.",
            "I have lived in my neighborhood for about ten years. When I first came here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I felt sad. I missed my old friends and home. But my parents wanted a better life for me and my sister. Stockbridge had better houses and schools. It was a good move.\n\nI made new friends and some enemies at school. I did not get to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They are good people. They feel like family. I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun and happy. I hope to have a wedding like that someday.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. I use GPS to explore it. I have gone with my friends Kason and Curtis to the park. We played video games a lot and had fun. Sometimes I go to the park alone. Nature gives me peace. I also practice balancing with sticks from Home Depot and my wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court, but I haven't played in a long time.\n\nMy dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a lot of fun, even when we worked hard.\n\nI have had a lot of fun in this neighborhood. There are many good memories. I know there are more good times to come.",
            "My house is near the college I go to. I like living there. There are many apartment buildings, with some restaurants and bars. The bars are not very expensive. One bar changed its name and is more expensive, but the drinks and service are good. The people there are nice. They are students or have low incomes. The apartments are not very expensive. There are many children nearby because there is a school close by. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of weed. The building managers put an air freshener near their door. It is funny. The buildings around me are old but may have new insides. \n\nDown the street are new apartments. I do not like them. They are cheaply built but expensive to rent. The rent is high because they are near the college. There is a cheap restaurant near me. They serve food on paper plates and most things are microwaved. Across from it is a gas station. People say it is not a good place to work. Last summer, the city put new sidewalks and grass on the road. It looks better. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut down a few trees, but there are still many. Behind my building is a line of trees, and then more apartments.\n\nI live on 42nd street. Behind me is 43rd street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees there, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime in the area happens at an apartment complex on 43rd street. But other apartments nearby also have crime. I like where I live. I can afford it, and it has what I need. I like that the college is walkable and there are bus stops close by.",
            "My home is in a small area.  Many houses look alike. They are small buildings with two living areas. All the houses are yellow with white steps and green roofs. Most people living here know each other.  We often talk outside in the evenings. The children play together. It is good to be here.  It is quiet and peaceful. \n\nThere are fields and trees around us. The sky is often blue with white clouds.  \n\nThis year, we had bad weather. There were warnings about tornadoes. One night, we heard loud alarms. We had to go to a safe place. I went to my bathroom with my small dog, my purse, and some pillows. My other dog stayed in the living room and was afraid.\n\nThere was a lot of hail. It made a loud noise when it hit the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steam came up. The hail melted quickly. The sun came out and it started to rain. There was a long rainbow in the sky. I took pictures with my camera. I shared them with my friends and family.  They were happy to see them.\n\nAfter the storm, people came back home. The children played again.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is nice to live here.\n\nI live in a two-bedroom apartment. All the apartments look the same outside. But inside, they are different sizes. Some are small. \n\nI like to walk in the field behind my house. There is a small pond there. I have seen deer and frogs. It is a good place to live. It is near Charlotte.  Every morning, I hear roosters crowing. It is like living in a small town. There is even a donkey on a nearby farm. We can hear it make noise in the evening. I am glad I found this nice place to live.",
            "I moved to this place when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I became close to two boys. One lives two houses away, and the other lives on my street. They do not live there now, but I still think about them. Most of the people who lived here when I first arrived are still here. My neighborhood is like most places in America. It has many two-story houses. On nice days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People here leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many things online, and no one has ever taken them from my porch. I trust my neighbors.\n\nThere is a park near my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other boys. Once, I got hurt badly playing football, but the good times are better than the bad. Now, I go to the park with my cousins' kids. They are much younger than me and like to play on the swings and slides. Just thinking about the park makes them happy. The park makes me think about the past.\n\nMy neighborhood has many different kinds of people. There are many places to eat. In just one mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian food. But many people order food using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food places are popular, but you can find them anywhere. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There is even a store owned by an Indian family if you want to cook or buy Indian food.\n\nI like my neighborhood. Reading about bad things that happen to people in other neighborhoods on social media makes me thankful for mine.",
            "My town is small. It is in South Carolina. The town is known for peaches. It is called the Peach Capital of the World.  Most of the town is farms with peach trees and cows.  \n\nThe houses are far apart. They are two stories tall. Many have metal roofs. They are often far from the road.\n\nThere is one stop light in town.  There are a few stores there. There is a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, and a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small drug store. They are known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a grocery store called IGA. Many people go to a larger store in a nearby town for groceries. \n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things. There is a furniture store and a pet groomer. There is a doctor and a veterinarian. There is one elementary school. Older students go to school in another town.\n\nThere are no parks in town, but they are building one. There are not many places to go in town.  There are no movie theaters or bowling alleys. It is a quiet town.",
            "I first heard about my town on a show about missing people. It was strange. Most apartments cost more than one thousand dollars each month. I had not heard this story, and neither had my friends.  Maybe it is hard to live here. I know some friends feel sad at night. Things are expensive, but we have learned to save money. You like old toys from markets and clothes that are not new. You do not smell as much when you are older. You might smoke, or you just get used to things. But the market always feels important. The smell of being grown up is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays on your things even after you clean them.\n\nThere are three stores where you can buy used things within walking distance. If you start on one side, you can go to two stores that give money to good causes, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every day, but you cannot hear it in the stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, the store is quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, there are more cars and people. It is a growing city, they say. It is the home of a very big company that sells things online and sends them to people. It is still growing, and it has problems. It reminds me of New York City. Everyone has their own goals, and no one asks much from you. You can be alone and quiet, and people leave you alone. It is not like the South, where people care a lot about each other. No one asks about your life here. You can hide as much as you want, and the city keeps moving like waves on the beach. It is a lively place to be.\n\nBetween the man who plays piano next door and the two people who sing badly upstairs, there is always something happening. We are more like a community of friends than a group of strangers. We help each other when we need to, we celebrate birthdays, we mourn deaths, and we look after each other. In a way, I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they are kind to me. I clean up after myself and share food with them, and they do the same. I bring them their mail, and they bring me mine. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a big, empty building, but people like my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a big mistake with my life.",
            "My area is like most suburbs. The houses look the same. The homeowner's group keeps things neat.\n\nThe lawns are small and have flowers and rocks. There is a short drive way for each house. Every home has a two car garage. The roads are new and in good shape. There are no holes.\n\nMost homes have one story, but some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. We have one big box for all the mail at the end of the street. People use a key to get to their mail. There are two big boxes for packages too.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. It feels like both the city and the country. There are many pools and trails. You can walk or run.\n\nMost people here are older. The area is safe and everyone knows each other. There are some younger people here too. \n\nThe city is big, but it feels small. We have stores and things we need. We have one mall. It is small, but good. It takes about fifteen minutes to drive to bigger stores. We have stores for all kinds of food, from fancy food to cheap food with few workers.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and clean. It is like most suburbs. It has good things, but it is not special.",
            "I live in a small town. The town is near a big city. My house is on the east side of town. This side is not rich. Homes here are small and often rented. But the people here are kind. They say hello when I see them. There is some crime here, like in any town. A few years ago, a man was shot near my home. My neighbors lost their son in a shooting.  Luckily, nothing bad has happened to my family.\n\nOur town has been hurt by the drug problem. Many people have died. But there are good things here too. My son goes to a good school. The teachers are nice. He has friends and is happy there. \n\nThe town has shops and places to go. We can get what we need. Our house is small, but it is home. We have lived here for a long time and like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. There are old buildings there. I live in an apartment. It is seven stories tall. It is across from an old theater. Nearby is a small bar. Many people go there on warm nights.\n\nThere is a park near my house. It is big for this area. The park has walls. Steps go up the walls. In winter, homeless people live in tents near the park. They stay close together to keep warm. They are close to a center where they can wash up.\n\nI like my city. I like the people. Hilltop was a bad place in the past. There were gangs. The police came to clean up the streets. People remember these days. They work hard to keep the area clean. They care about their city. Some people say that white people should not walk around at night. I think this is from the past.  \n\nI think Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know about racism. I see it everywhere. I feel safe in my neighborhood. People are kind.\n\nI feel alive here. I have met good people. They help each other. This is my home.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a place where farms meet small tourist places. There are no big city stores like malls or Wal-Mart. To go shopping, you must drive. \n\nMy town is near two beautiful lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. There are many beaches nearby. \n\nThe houses in my neighborhood are not close together. They are old houses, some new and some old. Many have full basements. You can see the basements from the street. Many houses have aluminum siding. The houses are all different colors. Most have yards with things like trampolines and playsets. Some have gardens and fences for animals.\n\nThe people here are like people from all over Middle America. They work hard and raise families. You see children playing, people walking dogs, and people riding bikes. \n\nEveryone knows each other. You wave to your neighbors and smile at people you meet. The lawns are kept nice. There are no piles of leaves or overgrown bushes.\n\nThis neighborhood is not fancy, but it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It is a good place to come home to after a long day.\n\nThere is a sheriff’s office, jail, and health department nearby. The recycling center is close by too. There are baseball and softball fields where you can hear games. The town airport is nearby. You can hear planes taking off and landing.\n\nYou can walk to get ice cream. If you walk a little further, you can go downtown. My children can ride their bikes to the park. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

Some are gay, some are Jewish, and some are from Russia. There are other areas in the city with many people from different countries. For example, there is Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia. It is hard to drive in the city. Traffic is bad. People drive a lot. There are not many sidewalks. It is hard to find a place to park. The city is building many new apartments.

It looks like houses from long ago when living in the suburbs was very popular. This dream used to make people happy.\n\nNow, fewer people think this way. But my neighborhood still shows the dream is alive. People are not as happy as before. Yards are not as nice. But there are still cars in the drives. Kids play like the world is all they know.\n\nThe old school is still here. It is almost ninety years old. It shows hope to the young and remembers the past for older people. There are not many churches, but the basketball courts are full.\n\nAll the houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big grocery store called Super \"A\". A big family from Yemen owns it. They are the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people are African American.\n\nThe streets are wide and kids play football. Cars stop for them. Many people have lived here for a long time. They know each other.\n\nThere used to be a karate school, but kids stopped going when karate movies were not popular. Now it is a medicine store.\n\nThere is a small movie theater. It shows old movies for less money. Young people do not like it, but older people do.\n\nThere is a big road that goes through town. It is not in our town exactly, but close.

            "This area looks small and quiet. It is behind stores, not a place people think to live. But if you walk behind the old store and old hotels, you find a busy place. There are many apartment buildings here. They are close together, like toys inside each other.\n\nThe first buildings were in the news for bad things. We will not talk about those. The next buildings are different. They are a secret, known only to a few.  Across from these buildings is a small school. Students go there with coffee in the morning. They walk slow. Drivers get mad when they are late. The road goes to another place with a park and a hospital.\n\nThe hospital helps people who are hurt. It has chairs outside and a fan that moves the hot air. Children play in the park. They run and jump. Old people walk their dogs and watch the young people. They talk about their lives.\n\nThere is a place to buy food and things for pools. People can get a meal and buy pool stuff. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Young people eat it while they ride their bikes and use special things that make smoke.\n\nThis area is a part of America. It is old and quiet. Not much changes here.",
            "\"Where is every thing?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields.  They filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the open space.  She was from a town where the store was a short walk away. She had never seen so much open land.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio.  In that moment, she understood who I am and where I come from.  \n\nWe drove down a small road. We came to a lake. A small town is just past it. The houses are made of brick and stucco.  Each house has a lot of land. People take pride in keeping it nice. In the spring, there are many flowers. The trees change color in the fall. The driveways have expensive cars. They shine in the sun after a car wash.\n\nMy neighbor is Korean. He is always outside. He mows his lawn all day. He sings while he mows. Everyone laughs at him, but he is a good person. He had a long life and has lost some of his memory. He used to be a doctor.  He likes to mow his lawn with a John Deere mower.\n\nYou will come to my house. Geese are in the side yard. Our dog chases them. There is a small stream behind the house. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and cows from the farms nearby.\n\nAcross a wooden bridge is a quiet place. There are trees, plants, and flowers.  I spent much of my childhood there. I built tree houses and chased animals. There were always friends to play with.\n\nWinter can be cold, but it is very beautiful. The yard changes from green to brown. The trees lose their leaves. When it snows, it looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot. In the winter, we used snowballs as weapons. We built forts to store our snowballs.\n\nIn our winter wonderland, we played pretend. It was a time when nothing else mattered. We were just kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon has a special way. People say it is \"weird\". The city has a sign that says \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some people like this sign because it shows a time when Portland was smaller and more different.  Others think it means Portland is a good place to be different. Even though many rich people from California move to Portland, and there are many new buildings, Portland is still weird. \n\n\"Weird\" does not mean everyone is nice to each other. But it means people accept things that are not usual. Portland has modern things like stores from China.  There are many ways to be different. But Portland also has normal things like yoga, people who like to look stylish, and people who work in offices. \n\nMaybe \"weird\" means people in Portland do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, houses have bright colors. People grow flowers, fruits, and vegetables in their yards. There are boxes outside in the summer. These boxes have things people do not want anymore. Sometimes these boxes have clothes or books. Sometimes they have something special. It is fun to see what is inside.  \n\nThis is what Portland means to me. But there are many kinds of weird people in Portland.  Some people would never take clothes from a box on the street. These people do things like yoga with goats or watch soccer games. Portland has people who like many different things.  \n\nPortland has some problems. Some people use drugs. This is often connected to mental health problems. The rain and clouds can make people feel sad.  There are also many homeless people. People in Portland want to help, but it is hard to know what to do.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun each morning and each evening. No matter how busy I am, they are there. They do not change. They do not care about problems. When I am stressed, I look at the mountains. They help me feel better. I came here for school. The mountains near the school were the first thing I liked. The school is pretty, with buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special. The town is also nice. There are many cafes where I studied. The center of town is old. The buildings are made of brick. It is busy there. But after a few blocks, the town is quiet again. This makes the town interesting. I have made many memories here. I have walked with friends in the park. I have seen movies in the theater. But there are sad memories too. The ponds are a good place to think. I have cried there when I felt lost. I watched the turtles and ducks. I wondered about my life. I walked past the pond, the park, and the houses. I reached a main street. The sun was shining. I saw the mountains. They were big and strong. They made me feel brave.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transport is good in New York City. Bensonhurst is a city neighborhood. You will see many Asian stores.\n\nMany Asian people live in Bensonhurst now. You will see an Asian store almost every block. Supermarkets and laundry stores are popular. People like them because the food is good, the prices are low, and they are close.  Near where I live, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other. This is very easy.\n\nBensonhurst is not only Asian. There are many different kinds of people. Many immigrants and their children live here. Most big stores are owned by Asians.\n\nThere is a new park nearby. It has basketball courts, a soccer field, handball courts, swings, and a playground. The park is diverse. Many different people play there. \n\nThere are not many big offices in Bensonhurst. There are buildings for apartments and small houses. Most people are nice, but they are loud. Cars play loud music and drive fast. It can be noisy!\n\nIf you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurst is safe, but people can be mean. You might meet people who want to fight or steal. I was bullied here once, but this was a long time ago.  People sometimes steal packages.\n\nPeople do not always clean up after their dogs. You might see dog waste on the sidewalk.\n\nBe careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "My house is at the top of a big hill.  People call it the “workout hill” because runners like to go up it. There are no sidewalks on my street, so people walk on the road. The road has holes and is hard to drive on. The telephone and electric wires look old and broken. It rains a lot here, so branches fall on the wires. The wires are fixed many times.\n\nThere are many tall trees around.  People do not like the trees. They want to cut them down. The trees block the view of the ocean.\n\nMany houses are built high on the hill with big windows to see the bay. The sunset is pretty. The water shines and the sky is orange. It is often cloudy. \n\nMoss grows on everything.  My car turned green after I left it in the driveway for a month.\n\nThere are not many children here. There is a school nearby, but most people are old. People have dogs. They sit in yards or run down the street. Dogs sometimes go into houses.\n\nRabbits are everywhere. Gardeners do not like them because they dig in the ground. My cats like to hunt rabbits. We also see birds: small birds, hummingbirds, hawks, and eagles.  \n\nThere are no stores near my house. If you go down to the water, there are some restaurants. You can eat seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not wide. You can see the other side.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street that connects two big roads. There are many cars on the street. \n\nMy neighborhood is quiet. Most people have lived here a long time. They take care of their yards and do normal things. In the winter, we go sledding down a small hill. Our house is at the corner. We see everyone driving by. \n\nWe know most of the cars. If we see a car we do not know, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise. Kids ride their bikes. It is normal. My wife and I work from home. We have two daughters, eleven and fourteen years old. We are home a lot. We play outside, even in the rain.\n\nWe often grill on our back deck. The smell is good. Many neighbors cut grass. We hear lawnmowers often from spring until fall. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was a forest before houses were built. There are many leaves in the fall. We rake and burn them. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has arrived.\n\nWe have not had much winter lately. It just feels like fall. Our garage is in the back. We do not use our front door much. I like to work in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.\n\nHolidays are quiet. Thanksgiving is busy. Many families visit. There are many cars. It is the same for Mother's Day and Christmas.\n\nI like living here. If it were not a busy street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the center of the high desert. There is much dirt. People who have not lived here do not know how it feels to see only brown. If you see a green lawn, you know that person spends a lot of money on it. When I first lived here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. It looks more like a city each day. Most places are changing this way. Most people here are friendly. Like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. My neighborhood has many friendly older people. This makes it a good place to live. The stores are big chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want good food, you must travel. I do not see many Whole Foods stores here. Most jobs in this city are in construction. I think this is because the city is still growing. There is much empty space. This makes me worried. I like things as they are. I left a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bar. I like the animals in my home. People come to the high desert for many reasons. One reason is the beautiful desert. The desert climate and land have made special places that need protection. These places are home to many animals. People should learn about the animals to live together safely. My family and I live well with the animals. My three children love lizards and desert bugs.\n\nVictorville has some attractions. It is good for families to experience the desert. They can have a different experience. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair is fun for everyone. Visit Wrightwood nearby to see the snow-covered mountains. You can learn winter sports there.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum has interesting things to see. There are rocks, old things, and objects from Native American people. These things show the history of Victorville.",
            "My neighbor hood is different. I live on a college campus. My friends in the dorms are my neighbors. The campus is also my neighbor hood. It is like other neighbor hoods. It has houses, people, stores, and a park. \n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds: apartments, regular houses, and dorm rooms. Apartments have 2 to 4 people per room. There are 4 to 6 rooms per floor. Most apartments have 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each building. \n\nThe regular houses are for rent. They have 2 to 4 bedrooms. Mostly older students live there. Dorm rooms are for students. Two students share a room. \n\nMy school has many different kinds of people. Students, teachers, and staff live here. Older students live in apartments, newer students live in dorms, and staff live in the regular houses. \n\nThere are many stores on campus. There are restaurants, shops, and grocery stores. You can get anything you need on campus. There is also a park. Everyone uses the park. It is safe and clean.",
            "I have lived in my neighborhood for about ten years. When I first came here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I felt sad. I missed my old friends and home. But my parents wanted a better life for me and my sister. Stockbridge had better houses and schools. It was a good move.\n\nI made new friends and some enemies at school. I did not get to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They are good people. They feel like family. I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun and happy. I hope to have a wedding like that someday.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. I use GPS to explore it. I have gone with my friends Kason and Curtis to the park. We played video games a lot and had fun. Sometimes I go to the park alone. Nature gives me peace. I also practice balancing with sticks from Home Depot and my wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court, but I haven't played in a long time.\n\nMy dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a lot of fun, even when we worked hard.\n\nI have had a lot of fun in this neighborhood. There are many good memories. I know there are more good times to come.",
            "My house is near the college I go to. I like living there. There are many apartment buildings, with some restaurants and bars. The bars are not very expensive. One bar changed its name and is more expensive, but the drinks and service are good. The people there are nice. They are students or have low incomes. The apartments are not very expensive. There are many children nearby because there is a school close by. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of weed. The building managers put an air freshener near their door. It is funny. The buildings around me are old but may have new insides. \n\nDown the street are new apartments. I do not like them. They are cheaply built but expensive to rent. The rent is high because they are near the college. There is a cheap restaurant near me. They serve food on paper plates and most things are microwaved. Across from it is a gas station. People say it is not a good place to work. Last summer, the city put new sidewalks and grass on the road. It looks better. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut down a few trees, but there are still many. Behind my building is a line of trees, and then more apartments.\n\nI live on 42nd street. Behind me is 43rd street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees there, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime in the area happens at an apartment complex on 43rd street. But other apartments nearby also have crime. I like where I live. I can afford it, and it has what I need. I like that the college is walkable and there are bus stops close by.",
            "My home is in a small area.  Many houses look alike. They are small buildings with two living areas. All the houses are yellow with white steps and green roofs. Most people living here know each other.  We often talk outside in the evenings. The children play together. It is good to be here.  It is quiet and peaceful. \n\nThere are fields and trees around us. The sky is often blue with white clouds.  \n\nThis year, we had bad weather. There were warnings about tornadoes. One night, we heard loud alarms. We had to go to a safe place. I went to my bathroom with my small dog, my purse, and some pillows. My other dog stayed in the living room and was afraid.\n\nThere was a lot of hail. It made a loud noise when it hit the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steam came up. The hail melted quickly. The sun came out and it started to rain. There was a long rainbow in the sky. I took pictures with my camera. I shared them with my friends and family.  They were happy to see them.\n\nAfter the storm, people came back home. The children played again.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is nice to live here.\n\nI live in a two-bedroom apartment. All the apartments look the same outside. But inside, they are different sizes. Some are small. \n\nI like to walk in the field behind my house. There is a small pond there. I have seen deer and frogs. It is a good place to live. It is near Charlotte.  Every morning, I hear roosters crowing. It is like living in a small town. There is even a donkey on a nearby farm. We can hear it make noise in the evening. I am glad I found this nice place to live.",
            "I moved to this place when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I became close to two boys. One lives two houses away, and the other lives on my street. They do not live there now, but I still think about them. Most of the people who lived here when I first arrived are still here. My neighborhood is like most places in America. It has many two-story houses. On nice days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People here leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many things online, and no one has ever taken them from my porch. I trust my neighbors.\n\nThere is a park near my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other boys. Once, I got hurt badly playing football, but the good times are better than the bad. Now, I go to the park with my cousins' kids. They are much younger than me and like to play on the swings and slides. Just thinking about the park makes them happy. The park makes me think about the past.\n\nMy neighborhood has many different kinds of people. There are many places to eat. In just one mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian food. But many people order food using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food places are popular, but you can find them anywhere. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There is even a store owned by an Indian family if you want to cook or buy Indian food.\n\nI like my neighborhood. Reading about bad things that happen to people in other neighborhoods on social media makes me thankful for mine.",
            "My town is small. It is in South Carolina. The town is known for peaches. It is called the Peach Capital of the World.  Most of the town is farms with peach trees and cows.  \n\nThe houses are far apart. They are two stories tall. Many have metal roofs. They are often far from the road.\n\nThere is one stop light in town.  There are a few stores there. There is a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, and a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small drug store. They are known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a grocery store called IGA. Many people go to a larger store in a nearby town for groceries. \n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things. There is a furniture store and a pet groomer. There is a doctor and a veterinarian. There is one elementary school. Older students go to school in another town.\n\nThere are no parks in town, but they are building one. There are not many places to go in town.  There are no movie theaters or bowling alleys. It is a quiet town.",
            "I first heard about my town on a show about missing people. It was strange. Most apartments cost more than one thousand dollars each month. I had not heard this story, and neither had my friends.  Maybe it is hard to live here. I know some friends feel sad at night. Things are expensive, but we have learned to save money. You like old toys from markets and clothes that are not new. You do not smell as much when you are older. You might smoke, or you just get used to things. But the market always feels important. The smell of being grown up is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays on your things even after you clean them.\n\nThere are three stores where you can buy used things within walking distance. If you start on one side, you can go to two stores that give money to good causes, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every day, but you cannot hear it in the stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, the store is quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, there are more cars and people. It is a growing city, they say. It is the home of a very big company that sells things online and sends them to people. It is still growing, and it has problems. It reminds me of New York City. Everyone has their own goals, and no one asks much from you. You can be alone and quiet, and people leave you alone. It is not like the South, where people care a lot about each other. No one asks about your life here. You can hide as much as you want, and the city keeps moving like waves on the beach. It is a lively place to be.\n\nBetween the man who plays piano next door and the two people who sing badly upstairs, there is always something happening. We are more like a community of friends than a group of strangers. We help each other when we need to, we celebrate birthdays, we mourn deaths, and we look after each other. In a way, I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they are kind to me. I clean up after myself and share food with them, and they do the same. I bring them their mail, and they bring me mine. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a big, empty building, but people like my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a big mistake with my life.",
            "My area is like most suburbs. The houses look the same. The homeowner's group keeps things neat.\n\nThe lawns are small and have flowers and rocks. There is a short drive way for each house. Every home has a two car garage. The roads are new and in good shape. There are no holes.\n\nMost homes have one story, but some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. We have one big box for all the mail at the end of the street. People use a key to get to their mail. There are two big boxes for packages too.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. It feels like both the city and the country. There are many pools and trails. You can walk or run.\n\nMost people here are older. The area is safe and everyone knows each other. There are some younger people here too. \n\nThe city is big, but it feels small. We have stores and things we need. We have one mall. It is small, but good. It takes about fifteen minutes to drive to bigger stores. We have stores for all kinds of food, from fancy food to cheap food with few workers.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and clean. It is like most suburbs. It has good things, but it is not special.",
            "I live in a small town. The town is near a big city. My house is on the east side of town. This side is not rich. Homes here are small and often rented. But the people here are kind. They say hello when I see them. There is some crime here, like in any town. A few years ago, a man was shot near my home. My neighbors lost their son in a shooting.  Luckily, nothing bad has happened to my family.\n\nOur town has been hurt by the drug problem. Many people have died. But there are good things here too. My son goes to a good school. The teachers are nice. He has friends and is happy there. \n\nThe town has shops and places to go. We can get what we need. Our house is small, but it is home. We have lived here for a long time and like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. There are old buildings there. I live in an apartment. It is seven stories tall. It is across from an old theater. Nearby is a small bar. Many people go there on warm nights.\n\nThere is a park near my house. It is big for this area. The park has walls. Steps go up the walls. In winter, homeless people live in tents near the park. They stay close together to keep warm. They are close to a center where they can wash up.\n\nI like my city. I like the people. Hilltop was a bad place in the past. There were gangs. The police came to clean up the streets. People remember these days. They work hard to keep the area clean. They care about their city. Some people say that white people should not walk around at night. I think this is from the past.  \n\nI think Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know about racism. I see it everywhere. I feel safe in my neighborhood. People are kind.\n\nI feel alive here. I have met good people. They help each other. This is my home.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a place where farms meet small tourist places. There are no big city stores like malls or Wal-Mart. To go shopping, you must drive. \n\nMy town is near two beautiful lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. There are many beaches nearby. \n\nThe houses in my neighborhood are not close together. They are old houses, some new and some old. Many have full basements. You can see the basements from the street. Many houses have aluminum siding. The houses are all different colors. Most have yards with things like trampolines and playsets. Some have gardens and fences for animals.\n\nThe people here are like people from all over Middle America. They work hard and raise families. You see children playing, people walking dogs, and people riding bikes. \n\nEveryone knows each other. You wave to your neighbors and smile at people you meet. The lawns are kept nice. There are no piles of leaves or overgrown bushes.\n\nThis neighborhood is not fancy, but it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It is a good place to come home to after a long day.\n\nThere is a sheriff’s office, jail, and health department nearby. The recycling center is close by too. There are baseball and softball fields where you can hear games. The town airport is nearby. You can hear planes taking off and landing.\n\nYou can walk to get ice cream. If you walk a little further, you can go downtown. My children can ride their bikes to the park. It is a great place to live."

            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n"

I like to walk to the stores and restaurants. There are also parks near my home. People take their children to the parks. There are many different kinds of people in my neighborhood. Some are gay, some are Jewish, and some are from Russia. There are other areas in the city with many people from different countries. For example, there is Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia. It is hard to drive in the city. Traffic is bad. People drive a lot. There are not many sidewalks. It is hard to find a place to park. The city is building many new apartments. People are moving to the city.\n\nMy neighborhood has many kinds of homes. Some are big buildings, and some are small houses. Some have one family, and some have two families.

It looks like houses from long ago when living in the suburbs was very popular. This dream used to make people happy.\n\nNow, fewer people think this way. But my neighborhood still shows the dream is alive. People are not as happy as before. Yards are not as nice. But there are still cars in the drives. Kids play like the world is all they know.\n\nThe old school is still here. It is almost ninety years old. It shows hope to the young and remembers the past for older people. There are not many churches, but the basketball courts are full.\n\nAll the houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big grocery store called Super \"A\". A big family from Yemen owns it. They are the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people are African American.\n\nThe streets are wide and kids play football. Cars stop for them. Many people have lived here for a long time. They know each other.\n\nThere used to be a karate school, but kids stopped going when karate movies were not popular. Now it is a medicine store.\n\nThere is a small movie theater. It shows old movies for less money. Young people do not like it, but older people do.\n\nThere is a big road that goes through town. It is not in our town exactly, but close.

            "This area looks small and quiet. It is behind stores, not a place people think to live. But if you walk behind the old store and old hotels, you find a busy place. There are many apartment buildings here. They are close together, like toys inside each other.\n\nThe first buildings were in the news for bad things. We will not talk about those. The next buildings are different. They are a secret, known only to a few.  Across from these buildings is a small school. Students go there with coffee in the morning. They walk slow. Drivers get mad when they are late. The road goes to another place with a park and a hospital.\n\nThe hospital helps people who are hurt. It has chairs outside and a fan that moves the hot air. Children play in the park. They run and jump. Old people walk their dogs and watch the young people. They talk about their lives.\n\nThere is a place to buy food and things for pools. People can get a meal and buy pool stuff. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Young people eat it while they ride their bikes and use special things that make smoke.\n\nThis area is a part of America. It is old and quiet. Not much changes here.",
            "\"Where is every thing?\" she asked as we drove past the corn fields.  They filled the horizon. \"This is it!\" I said. I knew she would be surprised by the open space.  She was from a town where the store was a short walk away. She had never seen so much open land.\n\nI told her about growing up in rural Ohio.  In that moment, she understood who I am and where I come from.  \n\nWe drove down a small road. We came to a lake. A small town is just past it. The houses are made of brick and stucco.  Each house has a lot of land. People take pride in keeping it nice. In the spring, there are many flowers. The trees change color in the fall. The driveways have expensive cars. They shine in the sun after a car wash.\n\nMy neighbor is Korean. He is always outside. He mows his lawn all day. He sings while he mows. Everyone laughs at him, but he is a good person. He had a long life and has lost some of his memory. He used to be a doctor.  He likes to mow his lawn with a John Deere mower.\n\nYou will come to my house. Geese are in the side yard. Our dog chases them. There is a small stream behind the house. You can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and cows from the farms nearby.\n\nAcross a wooden bridge is a quiet place. There are trees, plants, and flowers.  I spent much of my childhood there. I built tree houses and chased animals. There were always friends to play with.\n\nWinter can be cold, but it is very beautiful. The yard changes from green to brown. The trees lose their leaves. When it snows, it looks like a winter wonderland. My sister and I made snow angels and snowmen. We fought a lot. In the winter, we used snowballs as weapons. We built forts to store our snowballs.\n\nIn our winter wonderland, we played pretend. It was a time when nothing else mattered. We were just kids.",
            "Portland, Oregon has a special way. People say it is \"weird\". The city has a sign that says \"Keep Portland Weird\". Some people like this sign because it shows a time when Portland was smaller and more different.  Others think it means Portland is a good place to be different. Even though many rich people from California move to Portland, and there are many new buildings, Portland is still weird. \n\n\"Weird\" does not mean everyone is nice to each other. But it means people accept things that are not usual. Portland has modern things like stores from China.  There are many ways to be different. But Portland also has normal things like yoga, people who like to look stylish, and people who work in offices. \n\nMaybe \"weird\" means people in Portland do not take things too seriously. In my neighborhood, houses have bright colors. People grow flowers, fruits, and vegetables in their yards. There are boxes outside in the summer. These boxes have things people do not want anymore. Sometimes these boxes have clothes or books. Sometimes they have something special. It is fun to see what is inside.  \n\nThis is what Portland means to me. But there are many kinds of weird people in Portland.  Some people would never take clothes from a box on the street. These people do things like yoga with goats or watch soccer games. Portland has people who like many different things.  \n\nPortland has some problems. Some people use drugs. This is often connected to mental health problems. The rain and clouds can make people feel sad.  There are also many homeless people. People in Portland want to help, but it is hard to know what to do.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. They see the sun each morning and each evening. No matter how busy I am, they are there. They do not change. They do not care about problems. When I am stressed, I look at the mountains. They help me feel better. I came here for school. The mountains near the school were the first thing I liked. The school is pretty, with buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special. The town is also nice. There are many cafes where I studied. The center of town is old. The buildings are made of brick. It is busy there. But after a few blocks, the town is quiet again. This makes the town interesting. I have made many memories here. I have walked with friends in the park. I have seen movies in the theater. But there are sad memories too. The ponds are a good place to think. I have cried there when I felt lost. I watched the turtles and ducks. I wondered about my life. I walked past the pond, the park, and the houses. I reached a main street. The sun was shining. I saw the mountains. They were big and strong. They made me feel brave.",
            "If you visit Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, it is easy to find. Public transport is good in New York City. Bensonhurst is a city neighborhood. You will see many Asian stores.\n\nMany Asian people live in Bensonhurst now. You will see an Asian store almost every block. Supermarkets and laundry stores are popular. People like them because the food is good, the prices are low, and they are close.  Near where I live, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other. This is very easy.\n\nBensonhurst is not only Asian. There are many different kinds of people. Many immigrants and their children live here. Most big stores are owned by Asians.\n\nThere is a new park nearby. It has basketball courts, a soccer field, handball courts, swings, and a playground. The park is diverse. Many different people play there. \n\nThere are not many big offices in Bensonhurst. There are buildings for apartments and small houses. Most people are nice, but they are loud. Cars play loud music and drive fast. It can be noisy!\n\nIf you visit at night, be careful. Bensonhurst is safe, but people can be mean. You might meet people who want to fight or steal. I was bullied here once, but this was a long time ago.  People sometimes steal packages.\n\nPeople do not always clean up after their dogs. You might see dog waste on the sidewalk.\n\nBe careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "My house is at the top of a big hill.  People call it the “workout hill” because runners like to go up it. There are no sidewalks on my street, so people walk on the road. The road has holes and is hard to drive on. The telephone and electric wires look old and broken. It rains a lot here, so branches fall on the wires. The wires are fixed many times.\n\nThere are many tall trees around.  People do not like the trees. They want to cut them down. The trees block the view of the ocean.\n\nMany houses are built high on the hill with big windows to see the bay. The sunset is pretty. The water shines and the sky is orange. It is often cloudy. \n\nMoss grows on everything.  My car turned green after I left it in the driveway for a month.\n\nThere are not many children here. There is a school nearby, but most people are old. People have dogs. They sit in yards or run down the street. Dogs sometimes go into houses.\n\nRabbits are everywhere. Gardeners do not like them because they dig in the ground. My cats like to hunt rabbits. We also see birds: small birds, hummingbirds, hawks, and eagles.  \n\nThere are no stores near my house. If you go down to the water, there are some restaurants. You can eat seafood. There is not much of a beach, but the rocks are fun to throw into the water. The bay is not wide. You can see the other side.",
            "I live in a small town in Tennessee. My house is on a street that connects two big roads. There are many cars on the street. \n\nMy neighborhood is quiet. Most people have lived here a long time. They take care of their yards and do normal things. In the winter, we go sledding down a small hill. Our house is at the corner. We see everyone driving by. \n\nWe know most of the cars. If we see a car we do not know, we notice it. Some neighbors walk for exercise. Kids ride their bikes. It is normal. My wife and I work from home. We have two daughters, eleven and fourteen years old. We are home a lot. We play outside, even in the rain.\n\nWe often grill on our back deck. The smell is good. Many neighbors cut grass. We hear lawnmowers often from spring until fall. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was a forest before houses were built. There are many leaves in the fall. We rake and burn them. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall has arrived.\n\nWe have not had much winter lately. It just feels like fall. Our garage is in the back. We do not use our front door much. I like to work in the garage. When the doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood.\n\nHolidays are quiet. Thanksgiving is busy. Many families visit. There are many cars. It is the same for Mother's Day and Christmas.\n\nI like living here. If it were not a busy street, it would be perfect.",
            "My neighborhood is in the center of the high desert. There is much dirt. People who have not lived here do not know how it feels to see only brown. If you see a green lawn, you know that person spends a lot of money on it. When I first lived here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses. It looks more like a city each day. Most places are changing this way. Most people here are friendly. Like any city, there are good parts and bad parts. My neighborhood has many friendly older people. This makes it a good place to live. The stores are big chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want good food, you must travel. I do not see many Whole Foods stores here. Most jobs in this city are in construction. I think this is because the city is still growing. There is much empty space. This makes me worried. I like things as they are. I left a big city and do not want to go back. My job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bar. I like the animals in my home. People come to the high desert for many reasons. One reason is the beautiful desert. The desert climate and land have made special places that need protection. These places are home to many animals. People should learn about the animals to live together safely. My family and I live well with the animals. My three children love lizards and desert bugs.\n\nVictorville has some attractions. It is good for families to experience the desert. They can have a different experience. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair is fun for everyone. Visit Wrightwood nearby to see the snow-covered mountains. You can learn winter sports there.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum has interesting things to see. There are rocks, old things, and objects from Native American people. These things show the history of Victorville.",
            "My neighbor hood is different. I live on a college campus. My friends in the dorms are my neighbors. The campus is also my neighbor hood. It is like other neighbor hoods. It has houses, people, stores, and a park. \n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds: apartments, regular houses, and dorm rooms. Apartments have 2 to 4 people per room. There are 4 to 6 rooms per floor. Most apartments have 2 floors, so about 20 people live in each building. \n\nThe regular houses are for rent. They have 2 to 4 bedrooms. Mostly older students live there. Dorm rooms are for students. Two students share a room. \n\nMy school has many different kinds of people. Students, teachers, and staff live here. Older students live in apartments, newer students live in dorms, and staff live in the regular houses. \n\nThere are many stores on campus. There are restaurants, shops, and grocery stores. You can get anything you need on campus. There is also a park. Everyone uses the park. It is safe and clean.",
            "I have lived in my neighborhood for about ten years. When I first came here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I felt sad. I missed my old friends and home. But my parents wanted a better life for me and my sister. Stockbridge had better houses and schools. It was a good move.\n\nI made new friends and some enemies at school. I did not get to know my neighbors well, except for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They are good people. They feel like family. I remember going to Mr. Glen's wedding. It was fun and happy. I hope to have a wedding like that someday.\n\nThe neighborhood is like a maze. I use GPS to explore it. I have gone with my friends Kason and Curtis to the park. We played video games a lot and had fun. Sometimes I go to the park alone. Nature gives me peace. I also practice balancing with sticks from Home Depot and my wooden sword.\n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court, but I haven't played in a long time.\n\nMy dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had a lot of fun, even when we worked hard.\n\nI have had a lot of fun in this neighborhood. There are many good memories. I know there are more good times to come.",
            "My house is near the college I go to. I like living there. There are many apartment buildings, with some restaurants and bars. The bars are not very expensive. One bar changed its name and is more expensive, but the drinks and service are good. The people there are nice. They are students or have low incomes. The apartments are not very expensive. There are many children nearby because there is a school close by. I do not know my neighbors. They smoke a lot of weed. The building managers put an air freshener near their door. It is funny. The buildings around me are old but may have new insides. \n\nDown the street are new apartments. I do not like them. They are cheaply built but expensive to rent. The rent is high because they are near the college. There is a cheap restaurant near me. They serve food on paper plates and most things are microwaved. Across from it is a gas station. People say it is not a good place to work. Last summer, the city put new sidewalks and grass on the road. It looks better. My apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut down a few trees, but there are still many. Behind my building is a line of trees, and then more apartments.\n\nI live on 42nd street. Behind me is 43rd street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad, and the buildings look old. There are many trees there, maybe to hide the buildings. Most crime in the area happens at an apartment complex on 43rd street. But other apartments nearby also have crime. I like where I live. I can afford it, and it has what I need. I like that the college is walkable and there are bus stops close by.",
            "My home is in a small area.  Many houses look alike. They are small buildings with two living areas. All the houses are yellow with white steps and green roofs. Most people living here know each other.  We often talk outside in the evenings. The children play together. It is good to be here.  It is quiet and peaceful. \n\nThere are fields and trees around us. The sky is often blue with white clouds.  \n\nThis year, we had bad weather. There were warnings about tornadoes. One night, we heard loud alarms. We had to go to a safe place. I went to my bathroom with my small dog, my purse, and some pillows. My other dog stayed in the living room and was afraid.\n\nThere was a lot of hail. It made a loud noise when it hit the ground. After the storm, the road was hot and steam came up. The hail melted quickly. The sun came out and it started to rain. There was a long rainbow in the sky. I took pictures with my camera. I shared them with my friends and family.  They were happy to see them.\n\nAfter the storm, people came back home. The children played again.\n\nI like my neighborhood. It is nice to live here.\n\nI live in a two-bedroom apartment. All the apartments look the same outside. But inside, they are different sizes. Some are small. \n\nI like to walk in the field behind my house. There is a small pond there. I have seen deer and frogs. It is a good place to live. It is near Charlotte.  Every morning, I hear roosters crowing. It is like living in a small town. There is even a donkey on a nearby farm. We can hear it make noise in the evening. I am glad I found this nice place to live.",
            "I moved to this place when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard to make friends at first. But I became close to two boys. One lives two houses away, and the other lives on my street. They do not live there now, but I still think about them. Most of the people who lived here when I first arrived are still here. My neighborhood is like most places in America. It has many two-story houses. On nice days, I hear kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People here leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many things online, and no one has ever taken them from my porch. I trust my neighbors.\n\nThere is a park near my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other boys. Once, I got hurt badly playing football, but the good times are better than the bad. Now, I go to the park with my cousins' kids. They are much younger than me and like to play on the swings and slides. Just thinking about the park makes them happy. The park makes me think about the past.\n\nMy neighborhood has many different kinds of people. There are many places to eat. In just one mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian food. But many people order food using apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food places are popular, but you can find them anywhere. There are also many pizza places. The stores here have everything you need. There are dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store. There is even a store owned by an Indian family if you want to cook or buy Indian food.\n\nI like my neighborhood. Reading about bad things that happen to people in other neighborhoods on social media makes me thankful for mine.",
            "My town is small. It is in South Carolina. The town is known for peaches. It is called the Peach Capital of the World.  Most of the town is farms with peach trees and cows.  \n\nThe houses are far apart. They are two stories tall. Many have metal roofs. They are often far from the road.\n\nThere is one stop light in town.  There are a few stores there. There is a Chinese restaurant, a Mexican restaurant, and a small burger place. There used to be a pizza place, but it closed. There is a small drug store. They are known for their Cherry Coca-Cola. There is a grocery store called IGA. Many people go to a larger store in a nearby town for groceries. \n\nThe most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things. There is a furniture store and a pet groomer. There is a doctor and a veterinarian. There is one elementary school. Older students go to school in another town.\n\nThere are no parks in town, but they are building one. There are not many places to go in town.  There are no movie theaters or bowling alleys. It is a quiet town.",
            "I first heard about my town on a show about missing people. It was strange. Most apartments cost more than one thousand dollars each month. I had not heard this story, and neither had my friends.  Maybe it is hard to live here. I know some friends feel sad at night. Things are expensive, but we have learned to save money. You like old toys from markets and clothes that are not new. You do not smell as much when you are older. You might smoke, or you just get used to things. But the market always feels important. The smell of being grown up is old magazines on a closed piano. It stays on your things even after you clean them.\n\nThere are three stores where you can buy used things within walking distance. If you start on one side, you can go to two stores that give money to good causes, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every day, but you cannot hear it in the stores. No matter how many people or cars go by, the store is quiet. It is a good place to spend an afternoon. Every year, there are more cars and people. It is a growing city, they say. It is the home of a very big company that sells things online and sends them to people. It is still growing, and it has problems. It reminds me of New York City. Everyone has their own goals, and no one asks much from you. You can be alone and quiet, and people leave you alone. It is not like the South, where people care a lot about each other. No one asks about your life here. You can hide as much as you want, and the city keeps moving like waves on the beach. It is a lively place to be.\n\nBetween the man who plays piano next door and the two people who sing badly upstairs, there is always something happening. We are more like a community of friends than a group of strangers. We help each other when we need to, we celebrate birthdays, we mourn deaths, and we look after each other. In a way, I am lucky to be here. I like most of my neighbors, and they are kind to me. I clean up after myself and share food with them, and they do the same. I bring them their mail, and they bring me mine. It is nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I live in a big, empty building, but people like my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a big mistake with my life.",
            "My area is like most suburbs. The houses look the same. The homeowner's group keeps things neat.\n\nThe lawns are small and have flowers and rocks. There is a short drive way for each house. Every home has a two car garage. The roads are new and in good shape. There are no holes.\n\nMost homes have one story, but some are two stories. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. We have one big box for all the mail at the end of the street. People use a key to get to their mail. There are two big boxes for packages too.\n\nMy house is on the edge of the city. It feels like both the city and the country. There are many pools and trails. You can walk or run.\n\nMost people here are older. The area is safe and everyone knows each other. There are some younger people here too. \n\nThe city is big, but it feels small. We have stores and things we need. We have one mall. It is small, but good. It takes about fifteen minutes to drive to bigger stores. We have stores for all kinds of food, from fancy food to cheap food with few workers.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and clean. It is like most suburbs. It has good things, but it is not special.",
            "I live in a small town. The town is near a big city. My house is on the east side of town. This side is not rich. Homes here are small and often rented. But the people here are kind. They say hello when I see them. There is some crime here, like in any town. A few years ago, a man was shot near my home. My neighbors lost their son in a shooting.  Luckily, nothing bad has happened to my family.\n\nOur town has been hurt by the drug problem. Many people have died. But there are good things here too. My son goes to a good school. The teachers are nice. He has friends and is happy there. \n\nThe town has shops and places to go. We can get what we need. Our house is small, but it is home. We have lived here for a long time and like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill. There are old buildings there. I live in an apartment. It is seven stories tall. It is across from an old theater. Nearby is a small bar. Many people go there on warm nights.\n\nThere is a park near my house. It is big for this area. The park has walls. Steps go up the walls. In winter, homeless people live in tents near the park. They stay close together to keep warm. They are close to a center where they can wash up.\n\nI like my city. I like the people. Hilltop was a bad place in the past. There were gangs. The police came to clean up the streets. People remember these days. They work hard to keep the area clean. They care about their city. Some people say that white people should not walk around at night. I think this is from the past.  \n\nI think Hilltop sees me as one of them. I know about racism. I see it everywhere. I feel safe in my neighborhood. People are kind.\n\nI feel alive here. I have met good people. They help each other. This is my home.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is a place where farms meet small tourist places. There are no big city stores like malls or Wal-Mart. To go shopping, you must drive. \n\nMy town is near two beautiful lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. There are many beaches nearby. \n\nThe houses in my neighborhood are not close together. They are old houses, some new and some old. Many have full basements. You can see the basements from the street. Many houses have aluminum siding. The houses are all different colors. Most have yards with things like trampolines and playsets. Some have gardens and fences for animals.\n\nThe people here are like people from all over Middle America. They work hard and raise families. You see children playing, people walking dogs, and people riding bikes. \n\nEveryone knows each other. You wave to your neighbors and smile at people you meet. The lawns are kept nice. There are no piles of leaves or overgrown bushes.\n\nThis neighborhood is not fancy, but it is a good place to raise a family. It is quiet, peaceful, and safe. It is a good place to come home to after a long day.\n\nThere is a sheriff’s office, jail, and health department nearby. The recycling center is close by too. There are baseball and softball fields where you can hear games. The town airport is nearby. You can hear planes taking off and landing.\n\nYou can walk to get ice cream. If you walk a little further, you can go downtown. My children can ride their bikes to the park. It is a great place to live."
