            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

You might meet people who want to start trouble. I was bullied here once, but that was a long time ago. Recently, there have been problems with people stealing packages.\n\nAnother problem is that people do not clean up after their dogs. Despite a city rule, you will see dog waste everywhere. My biggest complaint is seeing dog waste on the floor. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "My home is on a big hill. There are not many sidewalks. People call it the \"work out hill\" because runners like to go up it.  There are no sidewalks on my street, so people walk in the road. The road is bad in some places. Some wires are old and look bad. It rains a lot, so branches fall on the wires.\n\nThere are many tall trees. People do not like them. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. Many houses are on the hill to see the water. At sunset, the water shines and the sky is orange. It is often cloudy, so the sun is not very bright. It is often wet and damp. Moss grows on everything.\n\nThere are not many children. There is a school nearby, but most people are old. People have dogs. They walk in yards or run in the street. Dogs like to go into houses if doors are open.\n\nRabbits live here. Some are big. Gardeners do not like them because they dig in gardens. My cats like rabbits. We do not see many rabbits now.\n\nWe have small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by, but crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores nearby.  There are a few restaurants at the water. There is not much beach, but the rocks are fun to throw in the water. The bay is not wide. We can see the other side.",
            "I live in a small town. It is in the southern part of Tennessee. My house is on a street that connects two big roads. There is lots of car traffic. But it is still a quiet place. Most people have lived here for a long time. They keep busy with yard work and daily tasks. In the winter, we go sledding down a hill. We live at the front corner of our street. We see everyone who goes by. We know most cars that drive here. If we see a new car, we pay attention. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes, like in any neighborhood. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. My daughters are eleven and fourteen years old. Everyone knows us. We go outside to play, even in the rain. Sometimes we have a barbecue on our back deck. It smells good. It seems like someone is always cutting grass. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from spring to fall. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a forest. There is a lot of shade, but lots of leaves in the fall. We have to rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. We haven't had much winter lately, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is in the back of our house. We rarely use the front door unless someone knocks. I like to work on my truck and other projects in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet. Thanksgiving is busy because families visit. There are extra cars parked everywhere. It is the same for Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. It would be perfect if it were not for the traffic.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. People who have not lived here may not know how it feels to see only brown. When you see a green lawn, you know the person who owns it pays a lot of money to keep it that way. When I first lived here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses, but they are still spread out. It looks more like a city every day. But most places are changing. The people here are usually friendly, like in any city, there are good parts and bad parts. I live in a nice neighborhood with lots of friendly older people.\n\nThe stores here are mostly big chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want better stores, you have to travel. I do not see many Whole Foods or stores like that. Most of the jobs in my city are in construction. I think this is because the city is still growing. There is lots of open space to build. This makes me nervous because I like it the way it is. I moved from a big city and I do not want to go back.\n\nMy job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bar. I like the animals in my home. People come to the high desert for many reasons, one of which is the beauty of the desert. The desert has special plants and animals that need protection. People who live here should learn about the animals to live together safely. My family and I get along well with the animals. My three children love lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them.\n\nVictorville has some attractions. It is a good place for families to experience the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair every year. It is fun for everyone. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum has interesting things to see. It has rocks, fossils, Native American things, and old objects that tell the story of Victorville.",
            "My neighborhood is not like other neighborhoods. I live on a college campus. My house is a dorm. My neighbors are the other students who live here. I also see the campus as part of my neighborhood.  Even though it is different, my neighborhood has some things in common with other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores, and a park. \n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses: apartments, regular houses, and dorm rooms. Apartments have two to four people in each room. There are four to six rooms on each floor. Most buildings have two floors. So, about twenty people live in each building. Regular houses are for rent. They usually have two to four bedrooms and are mostly for alumni. There are not many of these. Dorm rooms are the most common. They have two people in each room.\n\nMy school has people from many different places and ages. Professors and staff live in the houses. New students live in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nThe stores on campus are like stores in other neighborhoods. There are places to eat and stores that sell things like clothes and food. You can find almost anything you need on campus. There is also a park. It is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "I have lived in my neighborhood for about ten years. When I first came here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was sad. I missed my old friends and family. My parents wanted a better life for me and my sister, so we moved.  Stockbridge is a nice place with good schools and houses. \n\nAt first, it was hard to make new friends. I made some friends at school, but also some enemies. I got to know my neighbors, Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They are good people, almost like family.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen's wedding with my family. It was fun! I caught his wife's garter, but not the flowers. We danced all night. I enjoyed talking with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I hope she is doing well. \n\nMy neighborhood is like a maze, but now I use GPS to explore. I have gone to the park with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun.\n\nSometimes I go to the park to enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I like to practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword. \n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court, but I haven't played in a while. My dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had fun practicing. \n\nThere are many happy memories from this neighborhood, and I am excited for more to come!",
            "My house is near my school. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. There are also some small restaurants and bars. These places are not very expensive. One bar changed its name and is now more expensive. But the drinks are good. Most people here are students or have low incomes. The apartments are not very cost. There are many children because there is a school near my house.\n\nI do not know my neighbors. I do not want to. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The building manager put air freshener near their door. This is funny. The buildings are old, but the insides are modern. Down the street are new apartments. But I do not like them. They are built poorly. They cost a lot to rent, but they are near the school.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my house. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is microwaved. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. People say it is a bad place to work. The city repaired the road last summer. Now there is a good sidewalk, grass, and the area is nice.\n\nMy apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut down some trees, but there are still many. Behind my building is another set of apartments. My street is 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad. The buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. They hide the buildings.\n\nMost crime in my area is at an apartment complex on 43rd Street. But other apartment buildings have crime too. I like where I live. It is affordable and close to things I need. I like that the school is close and I can take the bus to the store and downtown.",
            "My home area has small houses. They are close to each other but look like they are far apart. All the houses are yellow with white front steps and green metal roofs. Most people know each other. We talk at the end of our driveways in the evening. The young kids play. It is nice to be away from computers and cars. It feels like a different time. We live near fields and trees. The sky is blue with white clouds. The bad thing is, we have had storms with tornadoes. Last night, we heard the loud sirens. I went to my bathtub with my small dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The hail fell very hard. The road got hot because of the change in temperature. The hail melted quickly. Then the sun came out and it rained. A double rainbow appeared! I took pictures to show my friends. The streets were quiet for a while. Then people came home. It was like nothing happened. We talked and ate dinner. My neighborhood is friendly. I like the way people talk here. I moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I have a small apartment, like everyone else. The outside looks the same but the inside is different. Some are very small, which is strange. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I have seen deer and a big frog. It is a good place to live. It is forty minutes from Charlotte. Every morning, roosters crow from the farms. It feels like a small village. There is a donkey on a farm nearby. We hear him in the evening. I am happy to live here.",
            "I moved to this area when I was about to start eighth grade.  It was hard to make friends at first, but I became close to two people.  One lives two houses away, and the other lives on my street. They do not live there now, but I still remember them. Most of the people who lived here when I first moved are still here. My neighborhood is like most American suburbs.\n\nThere are many two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside every weekend, or any time the weather is warm. The area is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many things online and never had anything taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. \n\nThere is a park near my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt there once playing football. I got hit in the nose. But the good memories are better. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my cousin's children. They are much younger. They like to play on swings and slides. Just thinking about the park makes them happy. It makes me feel nostalgic for many reasons.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of food nearby. You could find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants all within one mile. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered.\n\nFast food places are popular, but you can find those in any suburb. There are many pizza places too.  There are stores that sell everything you need. There are many dry cleaners. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There is even an Indian-owned store if you want to buy ingredients for Indian food or ready-made meals.  \n\nOverall, I like my neighborhood. Reading about problems others have with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My town is small. It is in South Carolina. It is not big like other towns. But, it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World.  There are many peach trees and farms with cows.\n\nMost houses are far apart. They are two stories tall. Some have metal roofs to keep cool. The houses are back from the road. This lets people grow food in front.\n\nIn the center of town is one stop light.  There are a few stores here. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong (a Chinese restaurant), Fiesta (Mexican food), and Gary's (burgers). There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small drug store called Maxwell and Halford. They are famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  There is also a grocery store called IGA. It is small, but people often go to a bigger store in another town for most of their food. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things and is always busy.\n\nThere is a furniture store called Possibilities. It is run by a nice woman. They even have movers! Next to the furniture store is a place to take care of pets. They do grooming, daycare, and more.\n\nThe doctor and vet are outside the main part of town. They are small, but good. There is one elementary school. Older students go to school in another town.\n\nThere are no parks in town, but they are making one. People want more places to go. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places for kids to play.\n\nIt is a quiet town. You could drive through and not even notice it!",
            "I first heard about my area on a podcast about missing people.  It was a little strange.  All the apartments cost more than one thousand dollars a month. I never heard this story.  My friends did not know it, either.  Maybe it is hard to live here. I know some friends are sad. Things cost a lot, but we learn to save money. You like old toys and clothes from stores that are not new. When you grow up, you smell different. You might smoke or be used to how things are. But, old stores are always there. The smell of being an adult is old magazines. They are on a piano that is not used. The smell goes into the leather and stays even after you wash it.  There are three used clothing stores near here. You can go to two charity stores, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every day. But you do not hear it in the stores. No matter how many people are around, the store is quiet. It is a good place to spend time.  Every year, there are more cars and people. It is a growing city, they say. It has one of the biggest online store companies. It is still changing. It reminds me of New York City. Everyone has their own goals. No one asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and do your own thing. People will not bother you. It is not like the South, where if you care about someone, people think you are nice. People here do not ask about your life. You can stay quiet as long as you want. The city will continue like waves on the beach. It is a fun place to live. The man next door plays the piano and two people upstairs sing.  There is always something happening.  We are more like friends than just people who live near each other. We help each other. We have parties, we go to funerals, and we help each other when we need it. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They are good to me. I clean up after myself and give them food, and they do the same. I bring them mail, and they bring me mail. It is nice to see them, and I think they like me too. I live in a big, boring building, but my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a big mistake in life.",
            "My neighborhood is like many others. It is a suburb.\n\nThere is a group that makes sure everyone follows the rules. The houses look the same. They are small and have yards with grass, rocks, and short driveways. Every house has a garage for two cars. The roads are new and smooth.\n\nMost houses are one story, but some are two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone has a key to open their box. There are also big boxes for packages.\n\nMy home is near the edge of the city. It feels like both a suburb and the country. We have many things to do, like pools and walking trails.\n\nMany people here are old. It is a safe place, and people help each other. There are also some middle-aged and young people who work.\n\nThe city is big, but it feels small. We have all the things we need, like a mall. It is not very big, but it has many stores. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to the mall. We have stores for food, clothes, and other things.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have good things here, and it is easy to go to the city when we need to.",
            "I live in a small town. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is one of the poorer parts of town. Most houses are rented to people with low incomes. But it is not a bad place to live. My neighbors are kind. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. There have been some bad things happen close to my home, like shootings and even a murder. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. We have not been hurt by crime, but things sometimes go missing from our porch.\n\nOur town has been hurt by the opioid problem. Many people have died from drug overdoses. But there are things to help people with this problem. There are places to go for help with addiction. There are classes to teach people how to help others with addiction.\n\nMy son goes to a good elementary school. The teachers and staff are great. He has special needs, but he is not bullied. The school is a good place for him. There is a group of parents who help the school. They do many things to help the school and families.\n\nBecause so many people in town are poor, the school gives free breakfast and lunch to all the students. No child goes hungry. The school does not treat any child badly because they cannot pay. School fees and supplies are not expensive.\n\nThe city government has made the town look nicer. They have fixed the roads and parks. But most of these changes are in the center of town, where the stores are. The east side where I live is not as nice.\n\nI like living in this town. The people are friendly. The schools are good. There are stores to buy what we need. Our house is not very valuable, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for a long time, and we like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill with old buildings. I live in a seven-story apartment building. It is across from the old live theater. A block away is a small bar. People like to go there on warm nights. Many people wait in a line to get in. There is a park near my home. It is big for this part of town. The park has a wall made of concrete. There are tall steps in the wall. In the winter, homeless people sleep in their tents near the steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot. The rain can be hard in the winter. The people sleep close together to stay warm. They are also near a place where they can bathe and shower.\n\nI like my city. It has old buildings and good architecture. But I like the people the most. My neighborhood was once dangerous. People say the government tried to stop the violence. The people remember this history. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean. They care about their city. Some people say that white people should not walk in the neighborhood at night. I think this is from the past. Maybe people see me as one of them, because I am dark. I know racism is a problem. People make assumptions about others.\n\nI know one thing: my neighborhood is home. I feel safe walking there at night. People have been kind to me. A laundromat owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone. Someone gave me money and told me I was beautiful.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in a place where you see farmlands and small towns for tourists. There are no big stores like malls or Wal-Mart. You must drive to go anywhere. My town is near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You find beaches everywhere. \n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are spread out, not close together. They are old homes, some new, some old. Many have full basements you can see from the street. Many have old aluminum siding. The houses are all colors. Most have yards with things like trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens or fences for animals. \n\nThe people here are hardworking. They work to make a living and raise families. You see kids playing, people walking dogs, and others biking or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. You know who is from here and who is not.\n\nThe lawns are nice. People take care of them. The grass is green and cut short. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood, but it feels safe and good for families. It is quiet and peaceful.\n\nNear my house is the sheriff's office, jail, health department, and recycling center. People from the town use these. There are baseball and softball fields near there, and a small airport. You can hear planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream, and it is not far to the town center. My kids can bike to the park, which is eight blocks away. This is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

Some drivers get angry at them.\n\nThere is a road that goes to another area. There is a park and a hospital there. The hospital helps people who are hurt. There are kids playing in the park. There are also old people walking their dogs. \n\nThere is a shopping area near the park. There is a place to eat sushi, a swimming store, and a place to get your nails done. You can do many things there. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Teens like to eat there.\n\nThis area is like a small town. It is quiet and peaceful.",
            "She asked, \"Where is everything?\"  We drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She would be shocked by how empty it looked. She was from a town where the store was close. She had never seen so much open space.  I told her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she understood me and where I came from.\n\nWe drove on a small road.  You will see a lake.  Near the lake is my house. The houses are mostly made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People take pride in keeping their yards nice. In spring, there are many flowers and trees. The driveways have fancy cars, like Mercedes. They shine in the sun after a car wash.\n\nAs we drive toward my house, my Korean neighbor is always outside. He mows his lawn all day and sings. Everyone laughs, but he is a kind person. He was a doctor, but he is older now. He blends in with the grass and his mower.\n\nMy house is here. Geese are in the side yard. Our dog chases them.  There is a little stream behind the house. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the farms.\n\nAcross a wooden bridge is a special place. There are trees, plants, and flowers. I played there as a child. I built forts and chased animals. There were always friends to play with.\n\nWinter is very cold, but it is beautiful. The yard is empty. Trees are bare. Sometimes it snows. A winter wonderland appears. There are snow angels and snowmen. My sister and I fought a lot. We used snowballs as weapons. We built forts to keep our snowballs. We played pretend in our winter world. We were just kids, happy and free.",
            "Portland, Oregon has a special feeling. People say it is \"weird.\" The town has a sign that says, \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some people say this is a memory of Portland from long ago, a place where things were different and people made their own fun. Other people see it as an invitation to come be weird with them. \n\nPortland has changed a lot. Many people from California have moved here. There are many new buildings. But Portland is still weird. \"Weird\" means accepting things that are not normal. \n\nPortland has many things like other cities. There are yoga classes, people who dress in a special way, and people who work in offices. Maybe weird means that people in Portland do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, houses are colorful. People grow plants in their yards. There are boxes on the street where people put things they no longer need. You can find clothes, books, or even strange things in these boxes. \n\nThis is what Portland is like to me. There are many different kinds of people here. Some people do yoga with goats, or go to soccer games. \n\nPortland has problems like other cities. There is a problem with drugs and homelessness. The weather can be sad, and that may make things harder.  But Portland is a place where people try to follow their dreams.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. Every day, they see the sun rise and set. I forget about them sometimes. I am busy with work and life. But they are still there. They do not change. They do not care about life’s problems. When I am stressed, the mountains call to me. When I look at them, I feel calm. They give me strength. \n\nI moved here when I started college. The mountains north of campus were the first thing that caught my eye. The university is beautiful, with its buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special.\n\nThe town is also nice. There are many cafes where students study. The downtown area has old buildings. It feels like a city. But it is not far from the quiet town. This mix of places makes the town interesting.\n\nI have made many happy memories here. I walked past the park swings with friends after studying all night. We watched movies at a fancy theater.\n\nThe town also has sad memories. The ponds are good for thinking. I have cried there at two in the morning. I wondered about my life.\n\nI walked past the pond, the park, and the small houses. I walked until I reached a main street. The sun was shining on the palm trees. The sky was blue and yellow. As I looked up, I saw the mountains. They were there, like always. They were bigger than any building. They made me feel strong.",
            "You will not have a hard time finding Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Public transportation is easy to use and is very popular in New York City. Bensonhurst is a city neighborhood. You will still feel like you are in New York City. During your visit, you will see many Asian stores. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has had many new Asian people move in. You will see an Asian store on almost every block. The most popular stores are supermarkets and laundromats. These stores are very popular with people who live there. The food is good, the prices are low, and it is easy to go there. Near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other. This makes it easy to buy food.\n\nBensonhurst is not only for Asian people. It is very diverse. There are immigrants and their children who were born in America. Most of the big businesses are owned by Asian people. There is also a new park nearby. It has ten basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain. The park is very diverse.\n\nThere are not many big businesses in Bensonhurst. You will mostly see buildings for apartments or houses. Most people live in two-family houses.\n\nMost of the people are nice, but they are very loud. You will hear cars playing loud music or people speeding by. \n\nIf you are visiting at night, be careful. Bensonhurst is safe, but people can be unpredictable. You might meet people who want to start trouble. I was bullied here once, but that was a long time ago. Recently, there have been problems with people stealing packages.\n\nAnother problem is that people do not clean up after their dogs. Despite a city rule, you will see dog waste everywhere. My biggest complaint is seeing dog waste on the floor. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "My home is on a big hill. There are not many sidewalks. People call it the \"work out hill\" because runners like to go up it.  There are no sidewalks on my street, so people walk in the road. The road is bad in some places. Some wires are old and look bad. It rains a lot, so branches fall on the wires.\n\nThere are many tall trees. People do not like them. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. Many houses are on the hill to see the water. At sunset, the water shines and the sky is orange. It is often cloudy, so the sun is not very bright. It is often wet and damp. Moss grows on everything.\n\nThere are not many children. There is a school nearby, but most people are old. People have dogs. They walk in yards or run in the street. Dogs like to go into houses if doors are open.\n\nRabbits live here. Some are big. Gardeners do not like them because they dig in gardens. My cats like rabbits. We do not see many rabbits now.\n\nWe have small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by, but crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores nearby.  There are a few restaurants at the water. There is not much beach, but the rocks are fun to throw in the water. The bay is not wide. We can see the other side.",
            "I live in a small town. It is in the southern part of Tennessee. My house is on a street that connects two big roads. There is lots of car traffic. But it is still a quiet place. Most people have lived here for a long time. They keep busy with yard work and daily tasks. In the winter, we go sledding down a hill. We live at the front corner of our street. We see everyone who goes by. We know most cars that drive here. If we see a new car, we pay attention. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes, like in any neighborhood. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. My daughters are eleven and fourteen years old. Everyone knows us. We go outside to play, even in the rain. Sometimes we have a barbecue on our back deck. It smells good. It seems like someone is always cutting grass. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from spring to fall. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a forest. There is a lot of shade, but lots of leaves in the fall. We have to rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. We haven't had much winter lately, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is in the back of our house. We rarely use the front door unless someone knocks. I like to work on my truck and other projects in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet. Thanksgiving is busy because families visit. There are extra cars parked everywhere. It is the same for Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. It would be perfect if it were not for the traffic.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. People who have not lived here may not know how it feels to see only brown. When you see a green lawn, you know the person who owns it pays a lot of money to keep it that way. When I first lived here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses, but they are still spread out. It looks more like a city every day. But most places are changing. The people here are usually friendly, like in any city, there are good parts and bad parts. I live in a nice neighborhood with lots of friendly older people.\n\nThe stores here are mostly big chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want better stores, you have to travel. I do not see many Whole Foods or stores like that. Most of the jobs in my city are in construction. I think this is because the city is still growing. There is lots of open space to build. This makes me nervous because I like it the way it is. I moved from a big city and I do not want to go back.\n\nMy job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bar. I like the animals in my home. People come to the high desert for many reasons, one of which is the beauty of the desert. The desert has special plants and animals that need protection. People who live here should learn about the animals to live together safely. My family and I get along well with the animals. My three children love lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them.\n\nVictorville has some attractions. It is a good place for families to experience the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair every year. It is fun for everyone. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum has interesting things to see. It has rocks, fossils, Native American things, and old objects that tell the story of Victorville.",
            "My neighborhood is not like other neighborhoods. I live on a college campus. My house is a dorm. My neighbors are the other students who live here. I also see the campus as part of my neighborhood.  Even though it is different, my neighborhood has some things in common with other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores, and a park. \n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses: apartments, regular houses, and dorm rooms. Apartments have two to four people in each room. There are four to six rooms on each floor. Most buildings have two floors. So, about twenty people live in each building. Regular houses are for rent. They usually have two to four bedrooms and are mostly for alumni. There are not many of these. Dorm rooms are the most common. They have two people in each room.\n\nMy school has people from many different places and ages. Professors and staff live in the houses. New students live in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nThe stores on campus are like stores in other neighborhoods. There are places to eat and stores that sell things like clothes and food. You can find almost anything you need on campus. There is also a park. It is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "I have lived in my neighborhood for about ten years. When I first came here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was sad. I missed my old friends and family. My parents wanted a better life for me and my sister, so we moved.  Stockbridge is a nice place with good schools and houses. \n\nAt first, it was hard to make new friends. I made some friends at school, but also some enemies. I got to know my neighbors, Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They are good people, almost like family.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen's wedding with my family. It was fun! I caught his wife's garter, but not the flowers. We danced all night. I enjoyed talking with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I hope she is doing well. \n\nMy neighborhood is like a maze, but now I use GPS to explore. I have gone to the park with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun.\n\nSometimes I go to the park to enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I like to practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword. \n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court, but I haven't played in a while. My dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had fun practicing. \n\nThere are many happy memories from this neighborhood, and I am excited for more to come!",
            "My house is near my school. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. There are also some small restaurants and bars. These places are not very expensive. One bar changed its name and is now more expensive. But the drinks are good. Most people here are students or have low incomes. The apartments are not very cost. There are many children because there is a school near my house.\n\nI do not know my neighbors. I do not want to. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The building manager put air freshener near their door. This is funny. The buildings are old, but the insides are modern. Down the street are new apartments. But I do not like them. They are built poorly. They cost a lot to rent, but they are near the school.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my house. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is microwaved. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. People say it is a bad place to work. The city repaired the road last summer. Now there is a good sidewalk, grass, and the area is nice.\n\nMy apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut down some trees, but there are still many. Behind my building is another set of apartments. My street is 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad. The buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. They hide the buildings.\n\nMost crime in my area is at an apartment complex on 43rd Street. But other apartment buildings have crime too. I like where I live. It is affordable and close to things I need. I like that the school is close and I can take the bus to the store and downtown.",
            "My home area has small houses. They are close to each other but look like they are far apart. All the houses are yellow with white front steps and green metal roofs. Most people know each other. We talk at the end of our driveways in the evening. The young kids play. It is nice to be away from computers and cars. It feels like a different time. We live near fields and trees. The sky is blue with white clouds. The bad thing is, we have had storms with tornadoes. Last night, we heard the loud sirens. I went to my bathtub with my small dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The hail fell very hard. The road got hot because of the change in temperature. The hail melted quickly. Then the sun came out and it rained. A double rainbow appeared! I took pictures to show my friends. The streets were quiet for a while. Then people came home. It was like nothing happened. We talked and ate dinner. My neighborhood is friendly. I like the way people talk here. I moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I have a small apartment, like everyone else. The outside looks the same but the inside is different. Some are very small, which is strange. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I have seen deer and a big frog. It is a good place to live. It is forty minutes from Charlotte. Every morning, roosters crow from the farms. It feels like a small village. There is a donkey on a farm nearby. We hear him in the evening. I am happy to live here.",
            "I moved to this area when I was about to start eighth grade.  It was hard to make friends at first, but I became close to two people.  One lives two houses away, and the other lives on my street. They do not live there now, but I still remember them. Most of the people who lived here when I first moved are still here. My neighborhood is like most American suburbs.\n\nThere are many two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside every weekend, or any time the weather is warm. The area is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many things online and never had anything taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. \n\nThere is a park near my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt there once playing football. I got hit in the nose. But the good memories are better. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my cousin's children. They are much younger. They like to play on swings and slides. Just thinking about the park makes them happy. It makes me feel nostalgic for many reasons.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of food nearby. You could find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants all within one mile. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered.\n\nFast food places are popular, but you can find those in any suburb. There are many pizza places too.  There are stores that sell everything you need. There are many dry cleaners. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There is even an Indian-owned store if you want to buy ingredients for Indian food or ready-made meals.  \n\nOverall, I like my neighborhood. Reading about problems others have with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My town is small. It is in South Carolina. It is not big like other towns. But, it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World.  There are many peach trees and farms with cows.\n\nMost houses are far apart. They are two stories tall. Some have metal roofs to keep cool. The houses are back from the road. This lets people grow food in front.\n\nIn the center of town is one stop light.  There are a few stores here. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong (a Chinese restaurant), Fiesta (Mexican food), and Gary's (burgers). There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small drug store called Maxwell and Halford. They are famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  There is also a grocery store called IGA. It is small, but people often go to a bigger store in another town for most of their food. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things and is always busy.\n\nThere is a furniture store called Possibilities. It is run by a nice woman. They even have movers! Next to the furniture store is a place to take care of pets. They do grooming, daycare, and more.\n\nThe doctor and vet are outside the main part of town. They are small, but good. There is one elementary school. Older students go to school in another town.\n\nThere are no parks in town, but they are making one. People want more places to go. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places for kids to play.\n\nIt is a quiet town. You could drive through and not even notice it!",
            "I first heard about my area on a podcast about missing people.  It was a little strange.  All the apartments cost more than one thousand dollars a month. I never heard this story.  My friends did not know it, either.  Maybe it is hard to live here. I know some friends are sad. Things cost a lot, but we learn to save money. You like old toys and clothes from stores that are not new. When you grow up, you smell different. You might smoke or be used to how things are. But, old stores are always there. The smell of being an adult is old magazines. They are on a piano that is not used. The smell goes into the leather and stays even after you wash it.  There are three used clothing stores near here. You can go to two charity stores, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every day. But you do not hear it in the stores. No matter how many people are around, the store is quiet. It is a good place to spend time.  Every year, there are more cars and people. It is a growing city, they say. It has one of the biggest online store companies. It is still changing. It reminds me of New York City. Everyone has their own goals. No one asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and do your own thing. People will not bother you. It is not like the South, where if you care about someone, people think you are nice. People here do not ask about your life. You can stay quiet as long as you want. The city will continue like waves on the beach. It is a fun place to live. The man next door plays the piano and two people upstairs sing.  There is always something happening.  We are more like friends than just people who live near each other. We help each other. We have parties, we go to funerals, and we help each other when we need it. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They are good to me. I clean up after myself and give them food, and they do the same. I bring them mail, and they bring me mail. It is nice to see them, and I think they like me too. I live in a big, boring building, but my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a big mistake in life.",
            "My neighborhood is like many others. It is a suburb.\n\nThere is a group that makes sure everyone follows the rules. The houses look the same. They are small and have yards with grass, rocks, and short driveways. Every house has a garage for two cars. The roads are new and smooth.\n\nMost houses are one story, but some are two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone has a key to open their box. There are also big boxes for packages.\n\nMy home is near the edge of the city. It feels like both a suburb and the country. We have many things to do, like pools and walking trails.\n\nMany people here are old. It is a safe place, and people help each other. There are also some middle-aged and young people who work.\n\nThe city is big, but it feels small. We have all the things we need, like a mall. It is not very big, but it has many stores. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to the mall. We have stores for food, clothes, and other things.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have good things here, and it is easy to go to the city when we need to.",
            "I live in a small town. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is one of the poorer parts of town. Most houses are rented to people with low incomes. But it is not a bad place to live. My neighbors are kind. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. There have been some bad things happen close to my home, like shootings and even a murder. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. We have not been hurt by crime, but things sometimes go missing from our porch.\n\nOur town has been hurt by the opioid problem. Many people have died from drug overdoses. But there are things to help people with this problem. There are places to go for help with addiction. There are classes to teach people how to help others with addiction.\n\nMy son goes to a good elementary school. The teachers and staff are great. He has special needs, but he is not bullied. The school is a good place for him. There is a group of parents who help the school. They do many things to help the school and families.\n\nBecause so many people in town are poor, the school gives free breakfast and lunch to all the students. No child goes hungry. The school does not treat any child badly because they cannot pay. School fees and supplies are not expensive.\n\nThe city government has made the town look nicer. They have fixed the roads and parks. But most of these changes are in the center of town, where the stores are. The east side where I live is not as nice.\n\nI like living in this town. The people are friendly. The schools are good. There are stores to buy what we need. Our house is not very valuable, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for a long time, and we like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill with old buildings. I live in a seven-story apartment building. It is across from the old live theater. A block away is a small bar. People like to go there on warm nights. Many people wait in a line to get in. There is a park near my home. It is big for this part of town. The park has a wall made of concrete. There are tall steps in the wall. In the winter, homeless people sleep in their tents near the steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot. The rain can be hard in the winter. The people sleep close together to stay warm. They are also near a place where they can bathe and shower.\n\nI like my city. It has old buildings and good architecture. But I like the people the most. My neighborhood was once dangerous. People say the government tried to stop the violence. The people remember this history. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean. They care about their city. Some people say that white people should not walk in the neighborhood at night. I think this is from the past. Maybe people see me as one of them, because I am dark. I know racism is a problem. People make assumptions about others.\n\nI know one thing: my neighborhood is home. I feel safe walking there at night. People have been kind to me. A laundromat owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone. Someone gave me money and told me I was beautiful.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in a place where you see farmlands and small towns for tourists. There are no big stores like malls or Wal-Mart. You must drive to go anywhere. My town is near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You find beaches everywhere. \n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are spread out, not close together. They are old homes, some new, some old. Many have full basements you can see from the street. Many have old aluminum siding. The houses are all colors. Most have yards with things like trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens or fences for animals. \n\nThe people here are hardworking. They work to make a living and raise families. You see kids playing, people walking dogs, and others biking or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. You know who is from here and who is not.\n\nThe lawns are nice. People take care of them. The grass is green and cut short. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood, but it feels safe and good for families. It is quiet and peaceful.\n\nNear my house is the sheriff's office, jail, health department, and recycling center. People from the town use these. There are baseball and softball fields near there, and a small airport. You can hear planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream, and it is not far to the town center. My kids can bike to the park, which is eight blocks away. This is a great place to live."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "My neighborhood is special. Many houses are single.  Some houses are cut in two, but they share a wall. My house has a small yard in front and a small driveway. It looks like houses from long ago. People used to want to live here. They called it the American dream. Many people liked it. But now, not so many. My neighborhood is still here. It shows that people still want this dream. People are not as happy as before. Yards are not as nice. But there are cars in each driveway. Kids play.\n\nThe school is old, almost ninety years. It is still here. It shows kids a future. Older people remember when it was new. There are not many churches. They are often empty. But the basketball courts are full. All the houses look different, but they feel the same. There is a big store called Super A. A big family from Yemen owns it. They are the only Arab family in the neighborhood. Most people are African American.\n\nThe streets are wide. Kids play football. They stop for cars. Many people have lived here for a long time. They know each other. There was a karate school, but it is now a drugstore. Kids do not want to be like the Karate Kid anymore. There is a small movie theater. It shows old movies cheaply. Young people do not like it. Older people like it. They enjoy a night out.\n\nThere is a big road that goes through the town. The entrance and exit are in the next town. People wanted an entrance and exit here. Young people supported it. Older people said no. They said it would ruin the town. The city agreed. They are building a new school. We are choosing a mascot. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be good.",
            "This is a small area. It has houses and stores. You might not think it has many interesting places. There is a big old store that is not used. There are also some hotels. People only stay there for a few weeks each year.  If you walk behind these places, you will see a lot of small apartment buildings. They look like toys put together. Some apartments are bad. We will not talk about them. But other apartments are good. \n\nNear the apartments is a school. It is small. Students go there to study. They walk to class in the morning. Some drivers get angry at them.\n\nThere is a road that goes to another area. There is a park and a hospital there. The hospital helps people who are hurt. There are kids playing in the park. There are also old people walking their dogs. \n\nThere is a shopping area near the park. There is a place to eat sushi, a swimming store, and a place to get your nails done. You can do many things there. There is also a place to buy frozen yogurt. Teens like to eat there.\n\nThis area is like a small town. It is quiet and peaceful.",
            "She asked, \"Where is everything?\"  We drove past the corn fields. \"This is it!\" I said. She would be shocked by how empty it looked. She was from a town where the store was close. She had never seen so much open space.  I told her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she understood me and where I came from.\n\nWe drove on a small road.  You will see a lake.  Near the lake is my house. The houses are mostly made of brick and stucco. Each house has a big yard. People take pride in keeping their yards nice. In spring, there are many flowers and trees. The driveways have fancy cars, like Mercedes. They shine in the sun after a car wash.\n\nAs we drive toward my house, my Korean neighbor is always outside. He mows his lawn all day and sings. Everyone laughs, but he is a kind person. He was a doctor, but he is older now. He blends in with the grass and his mower.\n\nMy house is here. Geese are in the side yard. Our dog chases them.  There is a little stream behind the house. You can hear frogs, the stream, and cows from the farms.\n\nAcross a wooden bridge is a special place. There are trees, plants, and flowers. I played there as a child. I built forts and chased animals. There were always friends to play with.\n\nWinter is very cold, but it is beautiful. The yard is empty. Trees are bare. Sometimes it snows. A winter wonderland appears. There are snow angels and snowmen. My sister and I fought a lot. We used snowballs as weapons. We built forts to keep our snowballs. We played pretend in our winter world. We were just kids, happy and free.",
            "Portland, Oregon has a special feeling. People say it is \"weird.\" The town has a sign that says, \"Keep Portland Weird.\" Some people say this is a memory of Portland from long ago, a place where things were different and people made their own fun. Other people see it as an invitation to come be weird with them. \n\nPortland has changed a lot. Many people from California have moved here. There are many new buildings. But Portland is still weird. \"Weird\" means accepting things that are not normal. \n\nPortland has many things like other cities. There are yoga classes, people who dress in a special way, and people who work in offices. Maybe weird means that people in Portland do not take things too seriously.\n\nIn my neighborhood, houses are colorful. People grow plants in their yards. There are boxes on the street where people put things they no longer need. You can find clothes, books, or even strange things in these boxes. \n\nThis is what Portland is like to me. There are many different kinds of people here. Some people do yoga with goats, or go to soccer games. \n\nPortland has problems like other cities. There is a problem with drugs and homelessness. The weather can be sad, and that may make things harder.  But Portland is a place where people try to follow their dreams.",
            "The mountains are always there. They are in the north. Every day, they see the sun rise and set. I forget about them sometimes. I am busy with work and life. But they are still there. They do not change. They do not care about life’s problems. When I am stressed, the mountains call to me. When I look at them, I feel calm. They give me strength. \n\nI moved here when I started college. The mountains north of campus were the first thing that caught my eye. The university is beautiful, with its buildings, ponds, and trees. But the mountains are special.\n\nThe town is also nice. There are many cafes where students study. The downtown area has old buildings. It feels like a city. But it is not far from the quiet town. This mix of places makes the town interesting.\n\nI have made many happy memories here. I walked past the park swings with friends after studying all night. We watched movies at a fancy theater.\n\nThe town also has sad memories. The ponds are good for thinking. I have cried there at two in the morning. I wondered about my life.\n\nI walked past the pond, the park, and the small houses. I walked until I reached a main street. The sun was shining on the palm trees. The sky was blue and yellow. As I looked up, I saw the mountains. They were there, like always. They were bigger than any building. They made me feel strong.",
            "You will not have a hard time finding Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Public transportation is easy to use and is very popular in New York City. Bensonhurst is a city neighborhood. You will still feel like you are in New York City. During your visit, you will see many Asian stores. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has had many new Asian people move in. You will see an Asian store on almost every block. The most popular stores are supermarkets and laundromats. These stores are very popular with people who live there. The food is good, the prices are low, and it is easy to go there. Near me, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of each other. This makes it easy to buy food.\n\nBensonhurst is not only for Asian people. It is very diverse. There are immigrants and their children who were born in America. Most of the big businesses are owned by Asian people. There is also a new park nearby. It has ten basketball courts, a big field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and a water fountain. The park is very diverse.\n\nThere are not many big businesses in Bensonhurst. You will mostly see buildings for apartments or houses. Most people live in two-family houses.\n\nMost of the people are nice, but they are very loud. You will hear cars playing loud music or people speeding by. \n\nIf you are visiting at night, be careful. Bensonhurst is safe, but people can be unpredictable. You might meet people who want to start trouble. I was bullied here once, but that was a long time ago. Recently, there have been problems with people stealing packages.\n\nAnother problem is that people do not clean up after their dogs. Despite a city rule, you will see dog waste everywhere. My biggest complaint is seeing dog waste on the floor. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!",
            "My home is on a big hill. There are not many sidewalks. People call it the \"work out hill\" because runners like to go up it.  There are no sidewalks on my street, so people walk in the road. The road is bad in some places. Some wires are old and look bad. It rains a lot, so branches fall on the wires.\n\nThere are many tall trees. People do not like them. They want to cut them down because the trees block the view of the ocean. Many houses are on the hill to see the water. At sunset, the water shines and the sky is orange. It is often cloudy, so the sun is not very bright. It is often wet and damp. Moss grows on everything.\n\nThere are not many children. There is a school nearby, but most people are old. People have dogs. They walk in yards or run in the street. Dogs like to go into houses if doors are open.\n\nRabbits live here. Some are big. Gardeners do not like them because they dig in gardens. My cats like rabbits. We do not see many rabbits now.\n\nWe have small birds and hummingbirds. Sometimes a hawk or eagle flies by, but crows chase it away.\n\nThere are no stores nearby.  There are a few restaurants at the water. There is not much beach, but the rocks are fun to throw in the water. The bay is not wide. We can see the other side.",
            "I live in a small town. It is in the southern part of Tennessee. My house is on a street that connects two big roads. There is lots of car traffic. But it is still a quiet place. Most people have lived here for a long time. They keep busy with yard work and daily tasks. In the winter, we go sledding down a hill. We live at the front corner of our street. We see everyone who goes by. We know most cars that drive here. If we see a new car, we pay attention. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids ride bikes, like in any neighborhood. We work from home. There are four of us: my wife, our two daughters, and me. My daughters are eleven and fourteen years old. Everyone knows us. We go outside to play, even in the rain. Sometimes we have a barbecue on our back deck. It smells good. It seems like someone is always cutting grass. We hear lawn mowers almost every day from spring to fall. We have many trees in our neighborhood. It was once a forest. There is a lot of shade, but lots of leaves in the fall. We have to rake and burn the leaves every year. I like the smell of burning leaves. It means fall is here. We haven't had much winter lately, so it feels like a long fall. Our garage is in the back of our house. We rarely use the front door unless someone knocks. I like to work on my truck and other projects in the garage. When the garage doors are open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. On holidays, it is quiet. Thanksgiving is busy because families visit. There are extra cars parked everywhere. It is the same for Mother's Day and Christmas. I like living here. It would be perfect if it were not for the traffic.",
            "My neighborhood is in the middle of the high desert. There is dirt everywhere. People who have not lived here may not know how it feels to see only brown. When you see a green lawn, you know the person who owns it pays a lot of money to keep it that way. When I first lived here in the 1990s, houses were far apart. Now there are more houses, but they are still spread out. It looks more like a city every day. But most places are changing. The people here are usually friendly, like in any city, there are good parts and bad parts. I live in a nice neighborhood with lots of friendly older people.\n\nThe stores here are mostly big chains, like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. If you want better stores, you have to travel. I do not see many Whole Foods or stores like that. Most of the jobs in my city are in construction. I think this is because the city is still growing. There is lots of open space to build. This makes me nervous because I like it the way it is. I moved from a big city and I do not want to go back.\n\nMy job is in construction. I install drywall and T-bar. I like the animals in my home. People come to the high desert for many reasons, one of which is the beauty of the desert. The desert has special plants and animals that need protection. People who live here should learn about the animals to live together safely. My family and I get along well with the animals. My three children love lizards and bugs. They are outside now trying to catch them.\n\nVictorville has some attractions. It is a good place for families to experience the desert. You can visit the San Bernardino County Fair every year. It is fun for everyone. You can also go to Wrightwood to see the snow-covered mountains and take winter sports lessons.\n\nThe Victor Valley Museum has interesting things to see. It has rocks, fossils, Native American things, and old objects that tell the story of Victorville.",
            "My neighborhood is not like other neighborhoods. I live on a college campus. My house is a dorm. My neighbors are the other students who live here. I also see the campus as part of my neighborhood.  Even though it is different, my neighborhood has some things in common with other neighborhoods. It has houses, people, stores, and a park. \n\nLet's talk about the houses. There are three kinds of houses: apartments, regular houses, and dorm rooms. Apartments have two to four people in each room. There are four to six rooms on each floor. Most buildings have two floors. So, about twenty people live in each building. Regular houses are for rent. They usually have two to four bedrooms and are mostly for alumni. There are not many of these. Dorm rooms are the most common. They have two people in each room.\n\nMy school has people from many different places and ages. Professors and staff live in the houses. New students live in dorms. Older students live in apartments.\n\nThe stores on campus are like stores in other neighborhoods. There are places to eat and stores that sell things like clothes and food. You can find almost anything you need on campus. There is also a park. It is clean and safe because everyone takes care of it.",
            "I have lived in my neighborhood for about ten years. When I first came here from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was sad. I missed my old friends and family. My parents wanted a better life for me and my sister, so we moved.  Stockbridge is a nice place with good schools and houses. \n\nAt first, it was hard to make new friends. I made some friends at school, but also some enemies. I got to know my neighbors, Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis. They are good people, almost like family.\n\nI went to Mr. Glen's wedding with my family. It was fun! I caught his wife's garter, but not the flowers. We danced all night. I enjoyed talking with Marsharii, one of his daughters. I hope she is doing well. \n\nMy neighborhood is like a maze, but now I use GPS to explore. I have gone to the park with my friends Kason and Curtis. We play video games and have fun.\n\nSometimes I go to the park to enjoy nature. It makes me feel calm and peaceful. I like to practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and bring my bokken wooden sword. \n\nThere is a basketball and tennis court, but I haven't played in a while. My dad taught me and my best friend to play tennis with Mr. Graves. We had fun practicing. \n\nThere are many happy memories from this neighborhood, and I am excited for more to come!",
            "My house is near my school. I like living here. There are many apartment buildings. There are also some small restaurants and bars. These places are not very expensive. One bar changed its name and is now more expensive. But the drinks are good. Most people here are students or have low incomes. The apartments are not very cost. There are many children because there is a school near my house.\n\nI do not know my neighbors. I do not want to. They smoke a lot of marijuana. The building manager put air freshener near their door. This is funny. The buildings are old, but the insides are modern. Down the street are new apartments. But I do not like them. They are built poorly. They cost a lot to rent, but they are near the school.\n\nThere is a cheap restaurant near my house. They serve food on paper plates. Most of the food is microwaved. Across from the restaurant is a gas station. People say it is a bad place to work. The city repaired the road last summer. Now there is a good sidewalk, grass, and the area is nice.\n\nMy apartment building is surrounded by trees. They cut down some trees, but there are still many. Behind my building is another set of apartments. My street is 42nd Street. Behind it is 43rd Street. It is not as nice. The sidewalks are bad. The buildings look old. There are many trees on this street. They hide the buildings.\n\nMost crime in my area is at an apartment complex on 43rd Street. But other apartment buildings have crime too. I like where I live. It is affordable and close to things I need. I like that the school is close and I can take the bus to the store and downtown.",
            "My home area has small houses. They are close to each other but look like they are far apart. All the houses are yellow with white front steps and green metal roofs. Most people know each other. We talk at the end of our driveways in the evening. The young kids play. It is nice to be away from computers and cars. It feels like a different time. We live near fields and trees. The sky is blue with white clouds. The bad thing is, we have had storms with tornadoes. Last night, we heard the loud sirens. I went to my bathtub with my small dog, my purse, and some pillows. My big dog stayed in the living room and barked. The hail fell very hard. The road got hot because of the change in temperature. The hail melted quickly. Then the sun came out and it rained. A double rainbow appeared! I took pictures to show my friends. The streets were quiet for a while. Then people came home. It was like nothing happened. We talked and ate dinner. My neighborhood is friendly. I like the way people talk here. I moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I have a small apartment, like everyone else. The outside looks the same but the inside is different. Some are very small, which is strange. I like to walk in the big field behind my house. There is a pond there. I have seen deer and a big frog. It is a good place to live. It is forty minutes from Charlotte. Every morning, roosters crow from the farms. It feels like a small village. There is a donkey on a farm nearby. We hear him in the evening. I am happy to live here.",
            "I moved to this area when I was about to start eighth grade.  It was hard to make friends at first, but I became close to two people.  One lives two houses away, and the other lives on my street. They do not live there now, but I still remember them. Most of the people who lived here when I first moved are still here. My neighborhood is like most American suburbs.\n\nThere are many two-story houses. I hear kids playing outside every weekend, or any time the weather is warm. The area is quiet most days. I have never had a problem with anyone here. People leave you alone unless you need help. I have ordered many things online and never had anything taken from my porch. I trust my neighbors. \n\nThere is a park near my house. I have many memories there. I played basketball, football, and baseball with other kids. I also got hurt there once playing football. I got hit in the nose. But the good memories are better. Now, I go to the park to spend time with my cousin's children. They are much younger. They like to play on swings and slides. Just thinking about the park makes them happy. It makes me feel nostalgic for many reasons.\n\nMy neighborhood is very diverse. There are many kinds of food nearby. You could find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants all within one mile. Many people use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get food delivered.\n\nFast food places are popular, but you can find those in any suburb. There are many pizza places too.  There are stores that sell everything you need. There are many dry cleaners. There is a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store on the same street. There is even an Indian-owned store if you want to buy ingredients for Indian food or ready-made meals.  \n\nOverall, I like my neighborhood. Reading about problems others have with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.",
            "My town is small. It is in South Carolina. It is not big like other towns. But, it is important for farming. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World.  There are many peach trees and farms with cows.\n\nMost houses are far apart. They are two stories tall. Some have metal roofs to keep cool. The houses are back from the road. This lets people grow food in front.\n\nIn the center of town is one stop light.  There are a few stores here. There are three places to get fast food: Hong Kong (a Chinese restaurant), Fiesta (Mexican food), and Gary's (burgers). There used to be a pizza place, but it closed.\n\nThere is a small drug store called Maxwell and Halford. They are famous for their Cherry Coca-Cola.  There is also a grocery store called IGA. It is small, but people often go to a bigger store in another town for most of their food. The most popular store is Dollar General. It sells many things and is always busy.\n\nThere is a furniture store called Possibilities. It is run by a nice woman. They even have movers! Next to the furniture store is a place to take care of pets. They do grooming, daycare, and more.\n\nThe doctor and vet are outside the main part of town. They are small, but good. There is one elementary school. Older students go to school in another town.\n\nThere are no parks in town, but they are making one. People want more places to go. There are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, or places for kids to play.\n\nIt is a quiet town. You could drive through and not even notice it!",
            "I first heard about my area on a podcast about missing people.  It was a little strange.  All the apartments cost more than one thousand dollars a month. I never heard this story.  My friends did not know it, either.  Maybe it is hard to live here. I know some friends are sad. Things cost a lot, but we learn to save money. You like old toys and clothes from stores that are not new. When you grow up, you smell different. You might smoke or be used to how things are. But, old stores are always there. The smell of being an adult is old magazines. They are on a piano that is not used. The smell goes into the leather and stays even after you wash it.  There are three used clothing stores near here. You can go to two charity stores, a library, a store with old books, and a store with strange things. Downtown is busy. Cars and people fill the streets every day. But you do not hear it in the stores. No matter how many people are around, the store is quiet. It is a good place to spend time.  Every year, there are more cars and people. It is a growing city, they say. It has one of the biggest online store companies. It is still changing. It reminds me of New York City. Everyone has their own goals. No one asks for much from you. You can be alone, quiet, and do your own thing. People will not bother you. It is not like the South, where if you care about someone, people think you are nice. People here do not ask about your life. You can stay quiet as long as you want. The city will continue like waves on the beach. It is a fun place to live. The man next door plays the piano and two people upstairs sing.  There is always something happening.  We are more like friends than just people who live near each other. We help each other. We have parties, we go to funerals, and we help each other when we need it. I am lucky to live here. I like most of my neighbors. They are good to me. I clean up after myself and give them food, and they do the same. I bring them mail, and they bring me mail. It is nice to see them, and I think they like me too. I live in a big, boring building, but my neighbors make me feel like I did not make a big mistake in life.",
            "My neighborhood is like many others. It is a suburb.\n\nThere is a group that makes sure everyone follows the rules. The houses look the same. They are small and have yards with grass, rocks, and short driveways. Every house has a garage for two cars. The roads are new and smooth.\n\nMost houses are one story, but some are two. We do not have mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there are mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone has a key to open their box. There are also big boxes for packages.\n\nMy home is near the edge of the city. It feels like both a suburb and the country. We have many things to do, like pools and walking trails.\n\nMany people here are old. It is a safe place, and people help each other. There are also some middle-aged and young people who work.\n\nThe city is big, but it feels small. We have all the things we need, like a mall. It is not very big, but it has many stores. It takes about 15 minutes to drive to the mall. We have stores for food, clothes, and other things.\n\nMy neighborhood is safe and nice. We have good things here, and it is easy to go to the city when we need to.",
            "I live in a small town. It is near a big city. My neighborhood is on the east side of town. It is one of the poorer parts of town. Most houses are rented to people with low incomes. But it is not a bad place to live. My neighbors are kind. They say hello when I walk by. Crime is a little higher here than in other parts of town. There have been some bad things happen close to my home, like shootings and even a murder. Our neighbors lost their son in a shooting last year. We have not been hurt by crime, but things sometimes go missing from our porch.\n\nOur town has been hurt by the opioid problem. Many people have died from drug overdoses. But there are things to help people with this problem. There are places to go for help with addiction. There are classes to teach people how to help others with addiction.\n\nMy son goes to a good elementary school. The teachers and staff are great. He has special needs, but he is not bullied. The school is a good place for him. There is a group of parents who help the school. They do many things to help the school and families.\n\nBecause so many people in town are poor, the school gives free breakfast and lunch to all the students. No child goes hungry. The school does not treat any child badly because they cannot pay. School fees and supplies are not expensive.\n\nThe city government has made the town look nicer. They have fixed the roads and parks. But most of these changes are in the center of town, where the stores are. The east side where I live is not as nice.\n\nI like living in this town. The people are friendly. The schools are good. There are stores to buy what we need. Our house is not very valuable, but it is comfortable. We have lived here for a long time, and we like it here.",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It is on a hill with old buildings. I live in a seven-story apartment building. It is across from the old live theater. A block away is a small bar. People like to go there on warm nights. Many people wait in a line to get in. There is a park near my home. It is big for this part of town. The park has a wall made of concrete. There are tall steps in the wall. In the winter, homeless people sleep in their tents near the steps. It does not snow much, but it rains a lot. The rain can be hard in the winter. The people sleep close together to stay warm. They are also near a place where they can bathe and shower.\n\nI like my city. It has old buildings and good architecture. But I like the people the most. My neighborhood was once dangerous. People say the government tried to stop the violence. The people remember this history. They work hard to keep their neighborhood clean. They care about their city. Some people say that white people should not walk in the neighborhood at night. I think this is from the past. Maybe people see me as one of them, because I am dark. I know racism is a problem. People make assumptions about others.\n\nI know one thing: my neighborhood is home. I feel safe walking there at night. People have been kind to me. A laundromat owner stayed open late so I could charge my phone. Someone gave me money and told me I was beautiful.",
            "I live in a small town in Michigan. It is in a place where you see farmlands and small towns for tourists. There are no big stores like malls or Wal-Mart. You must drive to go anywhere. My town is near two big lakes: Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix. You find beaches everywhere. \n\nMy neighborhood is like a small town. Houses are spread out, not close together. They are old homes, some new, some old. Many have full basements you can see from the street. Many have old aluminum siding. The houses are all colors. Most have yards with things like trampolines and playsets. Some people have gardens or fences for animals. \n\nThe people here are hardworking. They work to make a living and raise families. You see kids playing, people walking dogs, and others biking or rollerblading. Neighbors know each other. You know who is from here and who is not.\n\nThe lawns are nice. People take care of them. The grass is green and cut short. Plants and bushes are trimmed. It is not a fancy neighborhood, but it feels safe and good for families. It is quiet and peaceful.\n\nNear my house is the sheriff's office, jail, health department, and recycling center. People from the town use these. There are baseball and softball fields near there, and a small airport. You can hear planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream, and it is not far to the town center. My kids can bike to the park, which is eight blocks away. This is a great place to live."
