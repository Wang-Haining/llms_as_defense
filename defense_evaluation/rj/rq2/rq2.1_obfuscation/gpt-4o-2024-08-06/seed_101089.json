            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America, my home is in a quaint town in Michigan. It's a place where expansive farmlands transition seamlessly into charming tourist spots. Lacking the sprawling malls of a big city, there isn’t a Wal-Mart, Target, or Applebee’s in sight. Any destination requires a drive, yet I reside in one of the most stunning locales on the planet, embraced by water. My town is bordered by the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering beaches at every turn perfect for a quick dip. \n\nMy neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town life. The houses aren't crammed together or identical in design; instead, they have character, with some newly remodeled and others maintaining their vintage charm. Many of these homes feature full, visible basements, and a number display classic aluminum siding. The surrounding blocks burst with houses in every imaginable hue, each with its own yard. These yards host trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for pets. The homes speak to the spirit of Middle America, occupied by hardworking individuals, many of whom are nurturing families or have done so in the past.\n\nChildren can often be seen playing in the streets, while adults walk their dogs, bike, or rollerblade. The community is tightly knit, with neighbors recognizing each other and identifying newcomers. You might pass someone barbecuing or encounter a dog walker from a few streets away, exchanged with a friendly wave or smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with no remnants of autumn leaves, and grass kept neatly trimmed. Any plants or bushes are pruned to perfection. Although the neighborhood might not stun with opulence, it exudes a warm, familial appeal, suggesting it's an ideal place to raise a family. Its tranquility, safety, and peacefulness make it special. \n\nWithin a short walk, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, flanked by the Health Department. The city's recycling center is nearby, providing essential services to the community. Close to us are baseball and softball fields where the sounds of games echo, punctuated by announcers calling out player names. Adjacent to these fields is our modest town airport, where the hum of small planes is a familiar backdrop. A stroll can lead to the local ice cream shop, or even downtown for those who enjoy a longer walk. My children can easily bike to the park, just eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The place where I reside can best be summed up as a quintessential suburban area, replete with uniformity. The influence of a homeowner's association is evident in my neighborhood. As you enter, meticulously cared-for single-family homes line the streets, thanks to the oversight of the association. The front yards bear a striking resemblance to one another, each featuring a modest lawn, decorative stones, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot small trees. Every household boasts a two-car garage. While navigating through the neighborhood, you'll notice the roads are freshly paved and devoid of potholes, despite the diversity of families living here. Most homes are single-story, though two-story ones are also present. Unlike the typical single-family home setup, there aren't individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, like in apartment complexes, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, and residents use keys to access their specific boxes. Two larger lockers are available for parcels. Again, the HOA's penchant for uniformity is at play here. My house is situated on the outskirts of the city, blending suburban and rural elements. This location allows for ample space. There are several community pools, all well-kept and enclosed, available to residents. Additionally, there are numerous walking trails for dog walking or solitary evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood's size is sufficient for runs. The community predominantly consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where people look out for one another. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it has a surprisingly large population but retains a small-town vibe. Most amenities you'd expect are present, including a single mall that, while not massive, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to significant destinations, where I find a variety of stores. There are upscale grocery stores offering organic products and bargain outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to reduce costs. Overall, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and typical. It offers amenities such as pools and walking trails. Though not adjacent to shopping centers, a short drive provides access to major retail chains.",
            "The first time I came across my neighborhood, I was tuned into a podcast focusing on individuals who had disappeared. It caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment nearby was priced over a thousand dollars monthly. Neither my friends nor I had ever heard about that particular incident. Perhaps it's the challenge. Some of my friends find themselves crying at night. Life is costly, but we've become adept at living economically. Over time, you grow fond of the musty scent of flea market finds and clothes that have been stored away with mothballs. As adults, we seem to notice smells less. You might take up smoking or become desensitized to the general state of things. Yet, the flea market remains a constant presence. The aroma of adulthood is akin to dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It seeps into leather and lingers even after cleaning. Here, three thrift stores are conveniently nearby. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but inside the thrifts, it's quiet. No matter the hustle outside, the shops remain serene. It’s a perfect spot to while away an afternoon. Annually, more people and vehicles flood in. The city is evolving, as they say. Hosting one of the largest e-commerce and delivery giants, it still experiences growing pains. It reminds me of New York. People here are driven by their own ambitions, and there's little demand placed on you. You can enjoy solitude and independence without interference. Unlike the South, where concern often signifies care, here, privacy is respected. You can maintain your personal space as long as you wish, with the city rhythmically ebbing like waves on a shore. It’s a vibrant place to reside. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers above, there's always some activity. In many respects, we have less of a disconnected apartment building and more of a community. We support each other, celebrate milestones, and offer help when needed. In a sense, I’m fortunate to be here. I appreciate most of my neighbors, and they reciprocate with kindness. I make an effort to tidy up, share food, and they do likewise. We exchange mail deliveries. It’s good to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company just as I do theirs. Though I reside in an expansive, impersonal modern development, neighbors like mine make me feel I haven't completely lost my way.",
            "I reside in a quaint Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban fringe of a bustling city. My neighborhood, located on the town's eastern edge, is often regarded as the most economically challenged area here. The property market is quite modest, with most homes being either rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the neighborhood maintains a certain charm, and isn't unpleasant at all. My neighbors are mostly warm-hearted people who greet me with a smile when I stroll down the street. Although the crime rate here is a bit higher compared to other parts of the town, it remains relatively low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks of my home, including several shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors experienced a tragic loss when their son was shot outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has not been directly impacted by crime aside from the occasional disappearance of items left on our porch. The town I live in has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid crisis\" affecting many regions across the United States. Fentanyl overdoses have tragically claimed many lives. However, our town offers numerous resources to address this issue, including several addiction treatment centers and Narcan training sessions for the loved ones of those struggling with addiction. Despite these hurdles, the town possesses numerous positive qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an exceptional staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered any bullying, thanks to the school's incredibly supportive environment, which he absolutely adores. The PTO is highly active, organizing multiple events throughout the year to foster family engagement and educational development. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school-related costs, such as fees, supplies, and field trips, are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made numerous improvements to the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, most of these enhancements have been concentrated in the town center and the west side, where the shopping districts are located, and most traffic flows. The east side, where I reside, tends to be overlooked, which is a source of dissatisfaction for my neighborhood. All in all, I genuinely enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are ample shopping options, from small businesses to larger retail stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be highly valued, but it is comfortable and sufficient. We've been here for more than 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is vibrant with culture. Perched on a hill, it's enveloped by buildings rich with history. I reside in a seven-story apartment directly opposite an old theater, and just down the hill, there's an intriguing arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people eagerly waiting to get in. A few blocks in the other direction lies the nearest city park. It's quite spacious, considering its urban setting. The park is bordered by concrete, with high stairs built into the walls. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. While snow is rare, the heavy winter rains often make it challenging to stay warm. By clustering their tents in the center of town, rather than in more secluded areas, they manage to stay warmer. They're also conveniently near the only family center for miles, where they can access showers and bathing facilities. What I cherish most about my city isn't just the beauty of its historic architecture—the grand buildings and varied hilltop levels sloping towards the ocean. What truly captivates me is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories linger of federal agents and the DEA sweeping through the streets. The community remembers. Tales are passed down through generations, even reaching newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the residents strive to maintain and improve it. They care deeply about their community. There’s a common caution that white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning hearkens back to the past, carrying the bitter taste of social conditioning. Maybe it's because I can pass as someone who isn't entirely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-fueled assumptions that persist, even in a city celebrated as a cultural melting pot. One thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, encountering people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners have kept their doors open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere else to escape the rain. It's a place where I've huddled against storefronts on the dreariest of nights, only to have someone stop, meet my eyes, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I transitioned to this community just before beginning eighth grade. Initially, forging friendships was challenging, but eventually, I became close with a neighbor two doors away and another individual from my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories linger. Most of the original residents remain. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, characterized by numerous two-story residences. On weekends or warm days, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, it's a peaceful area during the week. I've never encountered issues with anyone here; people keep to themselves unless assistance is needed. I've ordered many packages without any being stolen from my porch, reinforcing my trust in my neighbors. A park is just a short walk from my home and holds many memories for me. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with local friends. Despite a painful incident where I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park now evokes a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is notably diverse, offering a variety of nearby dining options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisines within a mile. Many people now prefer using delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their meals. Fast food is prevalent, as expected in most suburban areas, along with numerous pizzerias. The local stores provide for all needs, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, common in the Midwest. There's also a diverse selection of stores, including an Indian-owned shop for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Stories of negative neighbor experiences shared on social media and the news make me grateful for the community I have.",
            "I reside in a neighborhood conveniently close to my college, which I find quite enjoyable. The area is primarily filled with apartment buildings, alongside a few restaurants and bars that offer entertainment without being too costly. One bar recently got a new name and is pricier, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The community is mostly friendly, with either college students or lower-income residents, as the apartments are relatively affordable. There's an elementary school nearby, so many children live in the area. I don't have much interaction with my neighbors and prefer it that way; they tend to smoke a lot, prompting building management to install an air freshener right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not a bit rude. The surrounding buildings often look aged from the outside, though some might have updated interiors. Further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because their construction was subpar, yet their rent is high—an unfortunate rip-off due to their proximity to campus. Nearby, there's a very inexpensive restaurant about a five-minute walk away that serves food on paper plates and relies heavily on microwaves. Across from it is a gas station, which reportedly isn't a great workplace. However, the city recently funded road improvements, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment building is nestled among trees, although a few have been removed, leaving stumps. More trees are around my place than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, located just behind, isn't as pleasant. Its sidewalks are deteriorating, and many buildings appear run-down. The trees on that street might be there to obscure the view of these buildings. My locality experiences most of its crime in an apartment complex on that street, though it's not the only source—there's also crime in the apartments across from me, which have a transient population. Nonetheless, I appreciate living here. It's affordable, with plenty of convenient amenities close by. The university's walking distance, and two bus stops make trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "In my neighborhood, duplexes line a cul-de-sac, with their placement giving the illusion of standalone homes. They're uniformly painted in yellow, accented by white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of driveways in the evening to chat while children play with toys, chalk, or kites. It feels like a step back in time amidst today's tech-driven world. The area is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds overhead. This season, however, we've had tornado warnings; last night, we heard the sirens and sought shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. Meanwhile, my larger dog stayed in the living room, anxious and barking. The storm left the area quiet except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. The temperature dropped rapidly from 92 to 75 degrees, and the hail melted quickly on the warm pavement. After the storm, the sun appeared, and as the skies cleared, a double rainbow emerged. I dashed inside to grab my camera and captured the moment to share with friends and family on Facebook, who were equally amazed. The streets remained silent for an hour until people returned home, resuming their usual activities with kids playing outside as dinner cooked. As someone new to the area, having moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I find the neighborhood welcoming and enjoy the southern accent. Each apartment has two bedrooms and two baths, but despite identical exteriors, the interiors vary in size. I love walking in the large field behind my home and wandering to the pond. I've seen deer, and in the morning, the calls of a bullfrog can be heard. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte, with mornings heralded by roosters from nearby farms. The sense of community is strong, akin to a village, with even a donkey at a nearby farm braying in the evenings. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having spent about a decade here, I feel ready to share my experiences. Initially, moving to this neighborhood was tough. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge brought tears, as I dearly missed my old friends. However, my parents aimed for a better life for my sister and me, offering improved housing and schooling, distinctly different from our previous 'ghetto' environment. Over time, I adapted, making new friends and, inevitably, some foes at school. Yet, I never really connected with many neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived close by. They have become like family to me, and I truly cherish them. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding when he remarried, a delightful occasion that inspires my own dreams of future happiness and prosperity. During the event, I caught the garter but missed the bouquet, and we danced the night away with Marsharii, one of his daughters, whom I haven’t seen since. I hope she’s doing well. \n\nThe neighborhood feels like a labyrinth, but with GPS, I can explore more. My adventures were often with Kason and Curtis, indulging in video games and reveling in life’s simple pleasures. Nature walks in the park bring a soothing peace, and I enjoy practicing balance with sticks from Home Depot or wielding my wooden bokken sword. Sports facilities like basketball and tennis courts are available, though I haven’t played recently. Tennis holds nostalgic memories, as my dad and Mr. Graves introduced me and my best friend to it, making those sessions both challenging and fun. Many fond memories have been created here, and I’m optimistic that even more wonderful experiences await.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming small town that might not seem extraordinary at first glance, yet it plays an important role in agriculture. Known as the Peach Capital of the World, Johnston proudly announces this claim on its welcoming sign. The landscape is largely agricultural, with vast stretches of land dedicated to peach orchards and cattle farming. Homes beyond the town center are generously spaced, mostly two-story structures featuring metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat, or covered with gray shingles. These residences are typically set back from the main roads, leaving ample space at the front for fields or livestock.\n\nThe heart of the town is marked by a solitary traffic light at a crossroads, where the town's few shops are found. If you’re in the mood for quick bites, you have limited choices: Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger joint. The town used to have a pizzeria, but it recently closed down. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy, is particularly famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The local grocery option is a small but pricey Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, where people often stop for just a few items, preferring to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping.\n\nDollar General holds the title of the busiest store in Johnston, offering a wide range of daily necessities and staying bustling from opening to closing. A small furniture store named Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a beloved community member, has long been a fixture in town, even offering delivery services with the help of two movers. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that also offers daycare, boarding, and various grooming services. Both the medical and veterinary practices are modestly sized but fully equipped to meet the needs of Johnston's residents, located a bit outside the main town area.\n\nChildren attend the single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, before moving on to middle and high school in a nearby town. While the town lacks any formal parks, plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract newcomers. Though there aren't entertainment venues like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, Johnston is a delightful town, small enough to miss if you're not paying attention as you pass through.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area located in a small town in southern Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, leading to a bit more traffic than I would prefer, yet the neighborhood remains generally peaceful. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents here. People mainly occupy themselves with tending to their yards and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on a side street nearby. Our house is situated at the front corner of the street, providing us with a view of everyone passing by, making us quite familiar with the vehicles commonly seen around here. When an unfamiliar car appears, we usually take notice. Some neighbors can be seen walking for exercise or taking their dogs for strolls. Children often ride their bikes, engaging in typical neighborhood activities. Since we work from home, my family and I—consisting of my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and myself—spend a considerable amount of time at home, and others are accustomed to seeing us come and go. We enjoy playing outside, sometimes even when it rains, and occasionally barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the delightful aroma of grilled food. Around here, the sound of lawn mowers is nearly constant from March until October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood, originally a wooded area, is rich with trees providing ample shade and an abundance of leaves during fall. This means annual leaf raking and burning, a scent I find pleasing as it signals the arrival of autumn. Recently, our winters have been mild, almost like an extended fall. Our garage is located at the back of the house, so the front door is rarely used unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays tend to be quiet, although Thanksgiving and other occasions like Mother's Day and Christmas bring visitors, resulting in extra cars around. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood situated right in the heart of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by endless stretches of dirt. It's hard for someone who hasn't lived here to grasp what it's like to constantly see shades of brown. Whenever you spot a green lawn, it's a clear sign that the homeowner is investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were few and far between. Although new development has occurred, that aspect hasn't changed much. The area is gradually taking on a more urban appearance, much like other places these days. Generally, the residents are quite welcoming, though, as with any urban area, there are both pleasant and less desirable sections. My neighborhood is filled with amiable elderly folks, making it quite a nice place to live. The local retail scene mostly consists of chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For more upscale shopping, you have to venture further; stores like Whole Foods are nowhere to be found here. Construction seems to be a significant industry in my city, likely because there's still plenty of undeveloped land available for building. This expansion worries me because I appreciate the current state of things. I left a bustling city and am not eager to return to that lifestyle. I'm employed in the construction sector myself, working as a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the aspects I enjoy most about living here is the diverse wildlife. People are drawn to the high desert for its striking beauty. The climate and landscape have produced unique ecosystems that need protection and are home to various creatures. It's important for the human inhabitants to understand and respect these animals to live in harmony. My family has adjusted well to the local wildlife. I have three children who are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, there are a few worth mentioning. Victorville is an excellent destination for families to explore the desert, offering a unique experience. If you visit, try to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair, which provides an enjoyable mix of activities. Nearby Wrightwood is perfect for seeing snow-covered mountains and taking winter sports lessons. Those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert should visit the Victor Valley Museum, which houses geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and items that showcase the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When I think about my neighborhood, my perspective might be a little different from the norm. Unlike many others who might think of a traditional neighborhood with homeowners leading separate lives, my situation is quite distinct. My concept of a neighborhood revolves around the college campus where I reside, with the dormitory residents as my community. I also consider the wider campus area to be part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite the uniqueness of my setting, my neighborhood shares several features with conventional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes residences, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by looking at the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. To begin, it's important to clarify the types of housing found here. There are three main housing types: apartments, standalone houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, you'll typically find 2-4 individuals per room, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have around two floors, housing approximately 20 people each. Then, there are the standalone houses available for school-affiliated individuals to rent, usually offering 2-4 bedrooms and often inhabited by alumni. These houses are less common due to their inefficiency. Lastly, the dormitories accommodate hundreds of students, generally with two people to a room, making them the most prevalent housing option. With housing described, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the neighborhood's demographic mix. Individuals from many cultures and age groups live here. Professional staff tend to reside in the standalone houses, newer students in the dormitories, and older students in apartment-style housing. Words alone can't fully capture the essence of the people here, so I'll shift focus to the stores and parks. My school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, offering a variety of stores and a single park. Stores range from dining options that resemble those in any neighborhood to the school's own brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Essentially, anything needed can be found within the neighborhood's limits. Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for the neighborhood's diverse population, maintained clean and safe by the community members.",
            "In my area, sidewalks are a rarity. The terrain slopes sharply, with my home perched atop the neighborhood's steepest incline. Locals often refer to it as the \"workout hill,\" favored by joggers for their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians share the road with vehicles. The pavement has its fair share of potholes, making driving somewhat precarious. Telephone and electric lines crisscross the area, appearing worn and patched due to frequent storms that bring down branches and other debris, necessitating constant repairs. Tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape, but they are unpopular with residents who prefer unobstructed ocean views. This desire leads to homes being constructed high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted upper floors to capture the bay's scenery. Sunsets here are stunning, as the water glows beneath an orange sky. However, clouds often obscure the sun, casting a hazy light over the area. Overcast, damp days are common, fostering moss growth on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, requiring hours of cleaning. Children are scarce in my neighborhood, even though a school is nearby. The community largely consists of older, retired individuals who favor dogs over kids. It's not unusual to see dogs lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street, and an open door might invite an unexpected canine visitor inside. Rabbits roam freely, much to the annoyance of gardeners who find their plants uprooted. My cats, however, have managed to reduce their numbers significantly. Birdwatchers can spot sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, though crows often drive them away. There are no shops nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The beach is limited, but the rocky shore provides ample entertainment for those who enjoy tossing stones into the bay. The bay is narrow enough to see the opposite shore clearly, mist permitting.",
            "If you're considering a trip to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, navigating there won't be much of a hassle. The area is well-served by public transit, which is a favored mode of getting around in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, maintaining that quintessential New York City vibe. During your exploration, you'll notice a significant presence of Asian-owned stores, a result of the substantial Asian community that has settled here over the last twenty years. These shops, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are quite prevalent and popular among locals due to their excellent quality, lower prices, and convenience. Close to my location, for instance, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk from one another, making grocery shopping extremely convenient. However, it's important to note that Bensonhurst isn't solely comprised of Asian residents; it's quite a melting pot, with immigrants and their children from various backgrounds. Many of the prominent businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these establishments, there's also a recently updated park nearby featuring multiple basketball courts, a sizable field for soccer or baseball, several handball courts, swings, a playground, and a refreshing water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. As you'd expect in New York City, the parks here are vibrant and diverse. People from all walks of life come together to interact and enjoy the facilities. The neighborhood doesn't have many towering corporate buildings; instead, it mostly consists of co-op or condo apartments and primarily two-family houses. The community is generally friendly, albeit a bit on the noisy side. It's common to hear cars with loud music or revving engines passing by, which can be quite the morning wake-up call. If you plan to visit at night, it's wise to stay alert. Although the area is relatively safe, unpredictability is a factor, with occasional troublemakers or petty thieves about. In fact, I've experienced bullying in the past, and package theft has been an issue recently. Despite fines for not picking up after dogs, some residents don't adhere to this rule, resulting in dog waste being a frequent sight on your morning walk to the train or supermarket. It's a personal annoyance of mine, so do watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To grasp what Portland, Oregon is truly about, one must first understand its unique interpretation of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, emblazoned on a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—often pushing legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was lesser-known, more affordable, fostering creative subcultures. For others, it’s an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant rise of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weirdness here doesn't necessarily mean acceptance of everything, but rather a tolerance for what is typically unaccepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or issues, either. Like the rest of America, we import most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to defy normalcy, yet Portland has its fair share of the ordinary—yoga, hipsters, and business professionals abound. Perhaps weirdness means taking all of this with a grain of salt. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland areas, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summer. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items people no longer need, yet often seem to contain a little magic—a perfect treasure for the passerby. Often filled with clothes and books, they can surprise with anything. The enchanting possibility of stumbling upon something special while wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood encapsulates the essence of Portland for me. But I represent just one version of weird among countless others. Some locals wouldn't dream of picking their clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or cheer at Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a city brimming with people chasing diverse passions. It's a place where some of us pursue our dreams, while others dream of pursuing them over a drink at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug issue, which often ties back to mental health struggles, exacerbated by the persistent rain and grey skies. The city also grapples with homelessness, a challenge without clear solutions. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively better social services, though still insufficient. The non-homeless residents oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this regard, perhaps we aren't so weird after all.",
            "The mountains stand silently, ever-present. To the north, they watch the sun rise and set every day. Regardless of how often I overlook them or become absorbed in the busyness of life, they remain steadfast, indifferent to life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they seem to call out, offering solace and strength when I take a moment to acknowledge them. I first encountered these mountains when I came here for my undergraduate studies, and they immediately caught my attention. While the university itself boasts impressive architecture, tranquil ponds, and lush trees that I hold dear, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is charming, with numerous cafés that have seen countless hours of intense study sessions. A short trip downtown reveals a blend of historic charm, with weathered bricks lining restaurants and offices, creating a vibrant atmosphere reminiscent of a bustling city. But this lively vibe only stretches so far before one can retreat to the peacefulness of the quieter parts of town, such as near the library. This close-knit mix of different atmospheres gives the city a magical feel, inviting exploration. It's easy to form treasured memories here, each tied to a specific spot. Whether it's strolling by the old swings in the park after a long night with friends or rushing through downtown to catch a university-sponsored movie at the theater, this place holds both joyful and difficult memories. The ponds, in particular, offer a space for reflection or emotional release during life’s chaotic moments. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives prompted me to ponder my own purpose as I navigated life's uncertainties. Walking past the pond, through the park, and by suburban homes, I eventually reached a main road. At that moment, the sun’s rays lit up the palm trees and painted the sky, revealing that I was heading north. Sure enough, the mountains were there, as always. Their towering presence against the hazy blue and yellow sky was more prominent than any building, and they quietly inspired a renewed sense of resilience within me.",
            "At first look, you might not give it much thought. It's tucked away behind a commercial strip, an unexpected spot for a residential area. One wouldn't typically associate it with desirable living spaces. However, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods, winding your way beyond the rarely filled hotels that see life only during family reunions each summer, you'll stumble upon a lively neighborhood. On these streets, a series of apartment complexes stand side by side, meticulously arranged like a set of Russian nesting dolls, each carefully separated and aligned along the road. The first set of apartments has gained some notoriety in the news for questionable activities, so let's not dwell on them much—appearances can be misleading, after all. But the neighboring complexes, along with the two adjacent ones, hold a different story that remains largely unknown to local residents. Across from these apartments lies a community college's satellite campus, a tranquil collection of buildings that seem to watch over the road. Students trickle in, coffee in hand, yawning as they begin their early morning classes. The old iron gates creak as they open to let them in, while drivers grumble impatiently at the increased traffic on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehab center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. The rehab facility has inviting porch furniture and a slow-moving ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids dash across the grass in the park, tumbling and spinning among the green blades, while bees lazily buzz around the flowerbeds lining the road. Retired folks walk their dogs on the paths, frowning at skateboarding teens and politely acknowledging teenage girls gathered near the playground, chatting about boys and the latest YouTube trends. Nearby, a strip mall hosts a sushi restaurant that serves affordable meals but never seems crowded. Next to it is a swim supply shop and a nail salon nestled between them. It's possible to prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor some hibachi chicken—all at the same place thanks to the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab chilled, topping-laden cups as they perform tricks on their skateboards and vape, thinking it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana, a slice of history in the unchanging, sleepy South where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood offers a unique blend of characteristics. Most residences are standalone, but there are a few that have been creatively divided into two units while remaining physically connected—if that makes any sense. My house features a modest front yard and a small driveway positioned to its left. Like many others here, it evokes images of an era not too distant when suburban life epitomized the American dream. This dream, once seemingly all-encompassing, now feels somewhat elusive. Nonetheless, my neighborhood and many like it persist, extending an invitation to visitors and residents alike that this dream is still very much alive, though we hold onto it with both challenges and hope. The community's optimism has waned, and the upkeep of the once-pristine lawns reflects this change, yet driveways remain occupied, and children continue to play as if their surroundings comprise their entire world. The local public school, with nearly 90 years of history, still stands, inspiring today's youth and evoking nostalgia among older inhabitants. While churches are sparse and largely unoccupied, the basketball courts remain bustling. Each home exudes its own character but shares a common essence. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" is run by a Yemeni family, possibly the sole Arab family in the area, amidst a predominantly African American community. The streets are expansive, and children often engage in football games, pausing only for passing vehicles. Many neighborhood residents have deep generational roots here and can recount tales from a time when everyone knew each other. There was a karate studio, but as Hollywood's interest in karate-themed films waned, so did the children's aspirations to emulate the Karate Kid, leading to its conversion into a pharmacy, because, as some say, pharmaceuticals solve everything. Additionally, there's a small cinema showing classic films at reduced rates, underappreciated by the youth for its lack of new releases, yet cherished by older patrons who appreciate the affordable escape from everyday life, sans children. Our town is bisected by an expressway, although the entry and exit ramps lie in the neighboring town. A petition once circulated to secure an exit for our community, supported by the younger generation but opposed by the elders, who believed an expressway would disrupt the town's essence. Ultimately, the elders swayed the city council against it. A new high school is under construction, prompting discussions about a suitable mascot. I propose a cyborg with a Southern drawl and a log cabin as a fitting symbol for our town.",
            "Living in a big city means my neighborhood is incredibly varied. Residential zones mix somewhat haphazardly with commercial districts, home to a range of businesses. These include office spaces, shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's always a new restaurant to try or a store to explore. While there are prominent chain stores owned by major corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity too. These boutiques are not just in malls; they also line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise peaceful neighborhoods bustling with attractions. Nearby, there are several parks where families often bring their young children. The neighborhood itself is quite diverse. There's a strong presence of the LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish group, and many refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city hosts a multitude of races and ethnicities, sometimes clustered into their own enclaves. We have areas known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, among others, though they are just a few miles away, traffic can make those miles feel much longer. Driving just 10 miles can take up to two hours during peak traffic times. Most people in my city don't walk much, despite some attractions being nearby, the city's vastness makes walking impractical. Consequently, traffic here is notorious, and finding parking is a challenge. Paradoxically, the city has seen a surge in construction, adding large apartment complexes. This popularity is exciting yet concerning for many residents who worry about increased congestion. Housing varies widely in my city; not everyone wants to live in a large apartment building. There are diverse housing options, including single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartments and condos. This diversity extends to the people living here, who are of all ages. Truthfully, I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, as it's not a close-knit community today. However, I cherish childhood memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and friends from the neighborhood.",
            "As we drove by the endless stretch of cornfields, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" aware of how the vast openness would surprise her. Coming from a place where the grocery store was just a short walk away, she'd never encountered such expansive rural scenery. I explained to her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood a part of me and my roots. On the narrow country road leading to my neighborhood, there's a water-filled quarry. Beyond it, the small community where I reside comes into view. The homes are primarily crafted from brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. Spring brings an array of vibrant flowers and the sight of midwestern trees changing with the seasons. Driveways are adorned with gleaming luxury cars, especially Mercedes Benz, shining after a thorough wash. As we approach my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside, welcoming with a warm smile. He spends his days meticulously mowing his lawn, his voice rising above the mower's hum. He's a source of amusement in the neighborhood, yet always sincere and fascinating, with a remarkable past. Once a respected doctor, he now blends into the background with his trusty mower. Finally, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese roam freely, playfully chased by our Terrier. Behind the house, a gentle stream flows into the quarry, accompanied by bullfrogs' croaks and distant farm noises. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies a pristine sanctuary filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This place was my childhood playground, where I built tree forts and engaged in playful 'hunting' with friends. Despite harsh winters, the landscape's beauty is unparalleled. The yard transforms from lush greenery to a stark wilderness. The once colorful trees become bare and skeletal. When snow graces the ground, a magical wonderland emerges. Snow angels crafted by my sister and snowmen dot the yard. We often quarreled, but during winter, snowball fights were our battles of choice. We constructed forts resembling igloos to store our snowy arsenal, using branches for protection. In this enchanted setting, we played, lost in our imaginations, carefree and innocent."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America, my home is in a quaint town in Michigan. It's a place where expansive farmlands transition seamlessly into charming tourist spots. Lacking the sprawling malls of a big city, there isn’t a Wal-Mart, Target, or Applebee’s in sight. Any destination requires a drive, yet I reside in one of the most stunning locales on the planet, embraced by water. My town is bordered by the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering beaches at every turn perfect for a quick dip. \n\nMy neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town life. The houses aren't crammed together or identical in design; instead, they have character, with some newly remodeled and others maintaining their vintage charm. Many of these homes feature full, visible basements, and a number display classic aluminum siding. The surrounding blocks burst with houses in every imaginable hue, each with its own yard. These yards host trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for pets. The homes speak to the spirit of Middle America, occupied by hardworking individuals, many of whom are nurturing families or have done so in the past.\n\nChildren can often be seen playing in the streets, while adults walk their dogs, bike, or rollerblade. The community is tightly knit, with neighbors recognizing each other and identifying newcomers. You might pass someone barbecuing or encounter a dog walker from a few streets away, exchanged with a friendly wave or smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with no remnants of autumn leaves, and grass kept neatly trimmed. Any plants or bushes are pruned to perfection. Although the neighborhood might not stun with opulence, it exudes a warm, familial appeal, suggesting it's an ideal place to raise a family. Its tranquility, safety, and peacefulness make it special. \n\nWithin a short walk, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, flanked by the Health Department. The city's recycling center is nearby, providing essential services to the community. Close to us are baseball and softball fields where the sounds of games echo, punctuated by announcers calling out player names. Adjacent to these fields is our modest town airport, where the hum of small planes is a familiar backdrop. A stroll can lead to the local ice cream shop, or even downtown for those who enjoy a longer walk. My children can easily bike to the park, just eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The place where I reside can best be summed up as a quintessential suburban area, replete with uniformity. The influence of a homeowner's association is evident in my neighborhood. As you enter, meticulously cared-for single-family homes line the streets, thanks to the oversight of the association. The front yards bear a striking resemblance to one another, each featuring a modest lawn, decorative stones, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot small trees. Every household boasts a two-car garage. While navigating through the neighborhood, you'll notice the roads are freshly paved and devoid of potholes, despite the diversity of families living here. Most homes are single-story, though two-story ones are also present. Unlike the typical single-family home setup, there aren't individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, like in apartment complexes, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, and residents use keys to access their specific boxes. Two larger lockers are available for parcels. Again, the HOA's penchant for uniformity is at play here. My house is situated on the outskirts of the city, blending suburban and rural elements. This location allows for ample space. There are several community pools, all well-kept and enclosed, available to residents. Additionally, there are numerous walking trails for dog walking or solitary evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood's size is sufficient for runs. The community predominantly consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where people look out for one another. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it has a surprisingly large population but retains a small-town vibe. Most amenities you'd expect are present, including a single mall that, while not massive, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to significant destinations, where I find a variety of stores. There are upscale grocery stores offering organic products and bargain outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to reduce costs. Overall, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and typical. It offers amenities such as pools and walking trails. Though not adjacent to shopping centers, a short drive provides access to major retail chains.",
            "The first time I came across my neighborhood, I was tuned into a podcast focusing on individuals who had disappeared. It caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment nearby was priced over a thousand dollars monthly. Neither my friends nor I had ever heard about that particular incident. Perhaps it's the challenge. Some of my friends find themselves crying at night. Life is costly, but we've become adept at living economically. Over time, you grow fond of the musty scent of flea market finds and clothes that have been stored away with mothballs. As adults, we seem to notice smells less. You might take up smoking or become desensitized to the general state of things. Yet, the flea market remains a constant presence. The aroma of adulthood is akin to dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It seeps into leather and lingers even after cleaning. Here, three thrift stores are conveniently nearby. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but inside the thrifts, it's quiet. No matter the hustle outside, the shops remain serene. It’s a perfect spot to while away an afternoon. Annually, more people and vehicles flood in. The city is evolving, as they say. Hosting one of the largest e-commerce and delivery giants, it still experiences growing pains. It reminds me of New York. People here are driven by their own ambitions, and there's little demand placed on you. You can enjoy solitude and independence without interference. Unlike the South, where concern often signifies care, here, privacy is respected. You can maintain your personal space as long as you wish, with the city rhythmically ebbing like waves on a shore. It’s a vibrant place to reside. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers above, there's always some activity. In many respects, we have less of a disconnected apartment building and more of a community. We support each other, celebrate milestones, and offer help when needed. In a sense, I’m fortunate to be here. I appreciate most of my neighbors, and they reciprocate with kindness. I make an effort to tidy up, share food, and they do likewise. We exchange mail deliveries. It’s good to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company just as I do theirs. Though I reside in an expansive, impersonal modern development, neighbors like mine make me feel I haven't completely lost my way.",
            "I reside in a quaint Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban fringe of a bustling city. My neighborhood, located on the town's eastern edge, is often regarded as the most economically challenged area here. The property market is quite modest, with most homes being either rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the neighborhood maintains a certain charm, and isn't unpleasant at all. My neighbors are mostly warm-hearted people who greet me with a smile when I stroll down the street. Although the crime rate here is a bit higher compared to other parts of the town, it remains relatively low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks of my home, including several shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors experienced a tragic loss when their son was shot outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has not been directly impacted by crime aside from the occasional disappearance of items left on our porch. The town I live in has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid crisis\" affecting many regions across the United States. Fentanyl overdoses have tragically claimed many lives. However, our town offers numerous resources to address this issue, including several addiction treatment centers and Narcan training sessions for the loved ones of those struggling with addiction. Despite these hurdles, the town possesses numerous positive qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an exceptional staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered any bullying, thanks to the school's incredibly supportive environment, which he absolutely adores. The PTO is highly active, organizing multiple events throughout the year to foster family engagement and educational development. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school-related costs, such as fees, supplies, and field trips, are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made numerous improvements to the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, most of these enhancements have been concentrated in the town center and the west side, where the shopping districts are located, and most traffic flows. The east side, where I reside, tends to be overlooked, which is a source of dissatisfaction for my neighborhood. All in all, I genuinely enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are ample shopping options, from small businesses to larger retail stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be highly valued, but it is comfortable and sufficient. We've been here for more than 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is vibrant with culture. Perched on a hill, it's enveloped by buildings rich with history. I reside in a seven-story apartment directly opposite an old theater, and just down the hill, there's an intriguing arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people eagerly waiting to get in. A few blocks in the other direction lies the nearest city park. It's quite spacious, considering its urban setting. The park is bordered by concrete, with high stairs built into the walls. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. While snow is rare, the heavy winter rains often make it challenging to stay warm. By clustering their tents in the center of town, rather than in more secluded areas, they manage to stay warmer. They're also conveniently near the only family center for miles, where they can access showers and bathing facilities. What I cherish most about my city isn't just the beauty of its historic architecture—the grand buildings and varied hilltop levels sloping towards the ocean. What truly captivates me is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories linger of federal agents and the DEA sweeping through the streets. The community remembers. Tales are passed down through generations, even reaching newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the residents strive to maintain and improve it. They care deeply about their community. There’s a common caution that white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning hearkens back to the past, carrying the bitter taste of social conditioning. Maybe it's because I can pass as someone who isn't entirely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-fueled assumptions that persist, even in a city celebrated as a cultural melting pot. One thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, encountering people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners have kept their doors open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere else to escape the rain. It's a place where I've huddled against storefronts on the dreariest of nights, only to have someone stop, meet my eyes, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I transitioned to this community just before beginning eighth grade. Initially, forging friendships was challenging, but eventually, I became close with a neighbor two doors away and another individual from my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories linger. Most of the original residents remain. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, characterized by numerous two-story residences. On weekends or warm days, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, it's a peaceful area during the week. I've never encountered issues with anyone here; people keep to themselves unless assistance is needed. I've ordered many packages without any being stolen from my porch, reinforcing my trust in my neighbors. A park is just a short walk from my home and holds many memories for me. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with local friends. Despite a painful incident where I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park now evokes a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is notably diverse, offering a variety of nearby dining options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisines within a mile. Many people now prefer using delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their meals. Fast food is prevalent, as expected in most suburban areas, along with numerous pizzerias. The local stores provide for all needs, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, common in the Midwest. There's also a diverse selection of stores, including an Indian-owned shop for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Stories of negative neighbor experiences shared on social media and the news make me grateful for the community I have.",
            "I reside in a neighborhood conveniently close to my college, which I find quite enjoyable. The area is primarily filled with apartment buildings, alongside a few restaurants and bars that offer entertainment without being too costly. One bar recently got a new name and is pricier, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The community is mostly friendly, with either college students or lower-income residents, as the apartments are relatively affordable. There's an elementary school nearby, so many children live in the area. I don't have much interaction with my neighbors and prefer it that way; they tend to smoke a lot, prompting building management to install an air freshener right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not a bit rude. The surrounding buildings often look aged from the outside, though some might have updated interiors. Further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because their construction was subpar, yet their rent is high—an unfortunate rip-off due to their proximity to campus. Nearby, there's a very inexpensive restaurant about a five-minute walk away that serves food on paper plates and relies heavily on microwaves. Across from it is a gas station, which reportedly isn't a great workplace. However, the city recently funded road improvements, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment building is nestled among trees, although a few have been removed, leaving stumps. More trees are around my place than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, located just behind, isn't as pleasant. Its sidewalks are deteriorating, and many buildings appear run-down. The trees on that street might be there to obscure the view of these buildings. My locality experiences most of its crime in an apartment complex on that street, though it's not the only source—there's also crime in the apartments across from me, which have a transient population. Nonetheless, I appreciate living here. It's affordable, with plenty of convenient amenities close by. The university's walking distance, and two bus stops make trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "In my neighborhood, duplexes line a cul-de-sac, with their placement giving the illusion of standalone homes. They're uniformly painted in yellow, accented by white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of driveways in the evening to chat while children play with toys, chalk, or kites. It feels like a step back in time amidst today's tech-driven world. The area is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds overhead. This season, however, we've had tornado warnings; last night, we heard the sirens and sought shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. Meanwhile, my larger dog stayed in the living room, anxious and barking. The storm left the area quiet except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. The temperature dropped rapidly from 92 to 75 degrees, and the hail melted quickly on the warm pavement. After the storm, the sun appeared, and as the skies cleared, a double rainbow emerged. I dashed inside to grab my camera and captured the moment to share with friends and family on Facebook, who were equally amazed. The streets remained silent for an hour until people returned home, resuming their usual activities with kids playing outside as dinner cooked. As someone new to the area, having moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I find the neighborhood welcoming and enjoy the southern accent. Each apartment has two bedrooms and two baths, but despite identical exteriors, the interiors vary in size. I love walking in the large field behind my home and wandering to the pond. I've seen deer, and in the morning, the calls of a bullfrog can be heard. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte, with mornings heralded by roosters from nearby farms. The sense of community is strong, akin to a village, with even a donkey at a nearby farm braying in the evenings. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having spent about a decade here, I feel ready to share my experiences. Initially, moving to this neighborhood was tough. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge brought tears, as I dearly missed my old friends. However, my parents aimed for a better life for my sister and me, offering improved housing and schooling, distinctly different from our previous 'ghetto' environment. Over time, I adapted, making new friends and, inevitably, some foes at school. Yet, I never really connected with many neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived close by. They have become like family to me, and I truly cherish them. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding when he remarried, a delightful occasion that inspires my own dreams of future happiness and prosperity. During the event, I caught the garter but missed the bouquet, and we danced the night away with Marsharii, one of his daughters, whom I haven’t seen since. I hope she’s doing well. \n\nThe neighborhood feels like a labyrinth, but with GPS, I can explore more. My adventures were often with Kason and Curtis, indulging in video games and reveling in life’s simple pleasures. Nature walks in the park bring a soothing peace, and I enjoy practicing balance with sticks from Home Depot or wielding my wooden bokken sword. Sports facilities like basketball and tennis courts are available, though I haven’t played recently. Tennis holds nostalgic memories, as my dad and Mr. Graves introduced me and my best friend to it, making those sessions both challenging and fun. Many fond memories have been created here, and I’m optimistic that even more wonderful experiences await.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming small town that might not seem extraordinary at first glance, yet it plays an important role in agriculture. Known as the Peach Capital of the World, Johnston proudly announces this claim on its welcoming sign. The landscape is largely agricultural, with vast stretches of land dedicated to peach orchards and cattle farming. Homes beyond the town center are generously spaced, mostly two-story structures featuring metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat, or covered with gray shingles. These residences are typically set back from the main roads, leaving ample space at the front for fields or livestock.\n\nThe heart of the town is marked by a solitary traffic light at a crossroads, where the town's few shops are found. If you’re in the mood for quick bites, you have limited choices: Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger joint. The town used to have a pizzeria, but it recently closed down. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy, is particularly famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The local grocery option is a small but pricey Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, where people often stop for just a few items, preferring to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping.\n\nDollar General holds the title of the busiest store in Johnston, offering a wide range of daily necessities and staying bustling from opening to closing. A small furniture store named Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a beloved community member, has long been a fixture in town, even offering delivery services with the help of two movers. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that also offers daycare, boarding, and various grooming services. Both the medical and veterinary practices are modestly sized but fully equipped to meet the needs of Johnston's residents, located a bit outside the main town area.\n\nChildren attend the single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, before moving on to middle and high school in a nearby town. While the town lacks any formal parks, plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract newcomers. Though there aren't entertainment venues like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, Johnston is a delightful town, small enough to miss if you're not paying attention as you pass through.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area located in a small town in southern Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, leading to a bit more traffic than I would prefer, yet the neighborhood remains generally peaceful. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents here. People mainly occupy themselves with tending to their yards and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on a side street nearby. Our house is situated at the front corner of the street, providing us with a view of everyone passing by, making us quite familiar with the vehicles commonly seen around here. When an unfamiliar car appears, we usually take notice. Some neighbors can be seen walking for exercise or taking their dogs for strolls. Children often ride their bikes, engaging in typical neighborhood activities. Since we work from home, my family and I—consisting of my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and myself—spend a considerable amount of time at home, and others are accustomed to seeing us come and go. We enjoy playing outside, sometimes even when it rains, and occasionally barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the delightful aroma of grilled food. Around here, the sound of lawn mowers is nearly constant from March until October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood, originally a wooded area, is rich with trees providing ample shade and an abundance of leaves during fall. This means annual leaf raking and burning, a scent I find pleasing as it signals the arrival of autumn. Recently, our winters have been mild, almost like an extended fall. Our garage is located at the back of the house, so the front door is rarely used unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays tend to be quiet, although Thanksgiving and other occasions like Mother's Day and Christmas bring visitors, resulting in extra cars around. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood situated right in the heart of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by endless stretches of dirt. It's hard for someone who hasn't lived here to grasp what it's like to constantly see shades of brown. Whenever you spot a green lawn, it's a clear sign that the homeowner is investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were few and far between. Although new development has occurred, that aspect hasn't changed much. The area is gradually taking on a more urban appearance, much like other places these days. Generally, the residents are quite welcoming, though, as with any urban area, there are both pleasant and less desirable sections. My neighborhood is filled with amiable elderly folks, making it quite a nice place to live. The local retail scene mostly consists of chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For more upscale shopping, you have to venture further; stores like Whole Foods are nowhere to be found here. Construction seems to be a significant industry in my city, likely because there's still plenty of undeveloped land available for building. This expansion worries me because I appreciate the current state of things. I left a bustling city and am not eager to return to that lifestyle. I'm employed in the construction sector myself, working as a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the aspects I enjoy most about living here is the diverse wildlife. People are drawn to the high desert for its striking beauty. The climate and landscape have produced unique ecosystems that need protection and are home to various creatures. It's important for the human inhabitants to understand and respect these animals to live in harmony. My family has adjusted well to the local wildlife. I have three children who are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, there are a few worth mentioning. Victorville is an excellent destination for families to explore the desert, offering a unique experience. If you visit, try to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair, which provides an enjoyable mix of activities. Nearby Wrightwood is perfect for seeing snow-covered mountains and taking winter sports lessons. Those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert should visit the Victor Valley Museum, which houses geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and items that showcase the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When I think about my neighborhood, my perspective might be a little different from the norm. Unlike many others who might think of a traditional neighborhood with homeowners leading separate lives, my situation is quite distinct. My concept of a neighborhood revolves around the college campus where I reside, with the dormitory residents as my community. I also consider the wider campus area to be part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite the uniqueness of my setting, my neighborhood shares several features with conventional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes residences, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by looking at the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. To begin, it's important to clarify the types of housing found here. There are three main housing types: apartments, standalone houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, you'll typically find 2-4 individuals per room, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have around two floors, housing approximately 20 people each. Then, there are the standalone houses available for school-affiliated individuals to rent, usually offering 2-4 bedrooms and often inhabited by alumni. These houses are less common due to their inefficiency. Lastly, the dormitories accommodate hundreds of students, generally with two people to a room, making them the most prevalent housing option. With housing described, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the neighborhood's demographic mix. Individuals from many cultures and age groups live here. Professional staff tend to reside in the standalone houses, newer students in the dormitories, and older students in apartment-style housing. Words alone can't fully capture the essence of the people here, so I'll shift focus to the stores and parks. My school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, offering a variety of stores and a single park. Stores range from dining options that resemble those in any neighborhood to the school's own brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Essentially, anything needed can be found within the neighborhood's limits. Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for the neighborhood's diverse population, maintained clean and safe by the community members.",
            "In my area, sidewalks are a rarity. The terrain slopes sharply, with my home perched atop the neighborhood's steepest incline. Locals often refer to it as the \"workout hill,\" favored by joggers for their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians share the road with vehicles. The pavement has its fair share of potholes, making driving somewhat precarious. Telephone and electric lines crisscross the area, appearing worn and patched due to frequent storms that bring down branches and other debris, necessitating constant repairs. Tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape, but they are unpopular with residents who prefer unobstructed ocean views. This desire leads to homes being constructed high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted upper floors to capture the bay's scenery. Sunsets here are stunning, as the water glows beneath an orange sky. However, clouds often obscure the sun, casting a hazy light over the area. Overcast, damp days are common, fostering moss growth on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, requiring hours of cleaning. Children are scarce in my neighborhood, even though a school is nearby. The community largely consists of older, retired individuals who favor dogs over kids. It's not unusual to see dogs lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street, and an open door might invite an unexpected canine visitor inside. Rabbits roam freely, much to the annoyance of gardeners who find their plants uprooted. My cats, however, have managed to reduce their numbers significantly. Birdwatchers can spot sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, though crows often drive them away. There are no shops nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The beach is limited, but the rocky shore provides ample entertainment for those who enjoy tossing stones into the bay. The bay is narrow enough to see the opposite shore clearly, mist permitting.",
            "If you're considering a trip to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, navigating there won't be much of a hassle. The area is well-served by public transit, which is a favored mode of getting around in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, maintaining that quintessential New York City vibe. During your exploration, you'll notice a significant presence of Asian-owned stores, a result of the substantial Asian community that has settled here over the last twenty years. These shops, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are quite prevalent and popular among locals due to their excellent quality, lower prices, and convenience. Close to my location, for instance, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk from one another, making grocery shopping extremely convenient. However, it's important to note that Bensonhurst isn't solely comprised of Asian residents; it's quite a melting pot, with immigrants and their children from various backgrounds. Many of the prominent businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these establishments, there's also a recently updated park nearby featuring multiple basketball courts, a sizable field for soccer or baseball, several handball courts, swings, a playground, and a refreshing water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. As you'd expect in New York City, the parks here are vibrant and diverse. People from all walks of life come together to interact and enjoy the facilities. The neighborhood doesn't have many towering corporate buildings; instead, it mostly consists of co-op or condo apartments and primarily two-family houses. The community is generally friendly, albeit a bit on the noisy side. It's common to hear cars with loud music or revving engines passing by, which can be quite the morning wake-up call. If you plan to visit at night, it's wise to stay alert. Although the area is relatively safe, unpredictability is a factor, with occasional troublemakers or petty thieves about. In fact, I've experienced bullying in the past, and package theft has been an issue recently. Despite fines for not picking up after dogs, some residents don't adhere to this rule, resulting in dog waste being a frequent sight on your morning walk to the train or supermarket. It's a personal annoyance of mine, so do watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To grasp what Portland, Oregon is truly about, one must first understand its unique interpretation of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, emblazoned on a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—often pushing legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was lesser-known, more affordable, fostering creative subcultures. For others, it’s an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant rise of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weirdness here doesn't necessarily mean acceptance of everything, but rather a tolerance for what is typically unaccepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or issues, either. Like the rest of America, we import most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to defy normalcy, yet Portland has its fair share of the ordinary—yoga, hipsters, and business professionals abound. Perhaps weirdness means taking all of this with a grain of salt. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland areas, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summer. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items people no longer need, yet often seem to contain a little magic—a perfect treasure for the passerby. Often filled with clothes and books, they can surprise with anything. The enchanting possibility of stumbling upon something special while wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood encapsulates the essence of Portland for me. But I represent just one version of weird among countless others. Some locals wouldn't dream of picking their clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or cheer at Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a city brimming with people chasing diverse passions. It's a place where some of us pursue our dreams, while others dream of pursuing them over a drink at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug issue, which often ties back to mental health struggles, exacerbated by the persistent rain and grey skies. The city also grapples with homelessness, a challenge without clear solutions. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively better social services, though still insufficient. The non-homeless residents oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this regard, perhaps we aren't so weird after all.",
            "The mountains stand silently, ever-present. To the north, they watch the sun rise and set every day. Regardless of how often I overlook them or become absorbed in the busyness of life, they remain steadfast, indifferent to life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they seem to call out, offering solace and strength when I take a moment to acknowledge them. I first encountered these mountains when I came here for my undergraduate studies, and they immediately caught my attention. While the university itself boasts impressive architecture, tranquil ponds, and lush trees that I hold dear, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is charming, with numerous cafés that have seen countless hours of intense study sessions. A short trip downtown reveals a blend of historic charm, with weathered bricks lining restaurants and offices, creating a vibrant atmosphere reminiscent of a bustling city. But this lively vibe only stretches so far before one can retreat to the peacefulness of the quieter parts of town, such as near the library. This close-knit mix of different atmospheres gives the city a magical feel, inviting exploration. It's easy to form treasured memories here, each tied to a specific spot. Whether it's strolling by the old swings in the park after a long night with friends or rushing through downtown to catch a university-sponsored movie at the theater, this place holds both joyful and difficult memories. The ponds, in particular, offer a space for reflection or emotional release during life’s chaotic moments. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives prompted me to ponder my own purpose as I navigated life's uncertainties. Walking past the pond, through the park, and by suburban homes, I eventually reached a main road. At that moment, the sun’s rays lit up the palm trees and painted the sky, revealing that I was heading north. Sure enough, the mountains were there, as always. Their towering presence against the hazy blue and yellow sky was more prominent than any building, and they quietly inspired a renewed sense of resilience within me.",
            "At first look, you might not give it much thought. It's tucked away behind a commercial strip, an unexpected spot for a residential area. One wouldn't typically associate it with desirable living spaces. However, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods, winding your way beyond the rarely filled hotels that see life only during family reunions each summer, you'll stumble upon a lively neighborhood. On these streets, a series of apartment complexes stand side by side, meticulously arranged like a set of Russian nesting dolls, each carefully separated and aligned along the road. The first set of apartments has gained some notoriety in the news for questionable activities, so let's not dwell on them much—appearances can be misleading, after all. But the neighboring complexes, along with the two adjacent ones, hold a different story that remains largely unknown to local residents. Across from these apartments lies a community college's satellite campus, a tranquil collection of buildings that seem to watch over the road. Students trickle in, coffee in hand, yawning as they begin their early morning classes. The old iron gates creak as they open to let them in, while drivers grumble impatiently at the increased traffic on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehab center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. The rehab facility has inviting porch furniture and a slow-moving ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids dash across the grass in the park, tumbling and spinning among the green blades, while bees lazily buzz around the flowerbeds lining the road. Retired folks walk their dogs on the paths, frowning at skateboarding teens and politely acknowledging teenage girls gathered near the playground, chatting about boys and the latest YouTube trends. Nearby, a strip mall hosts a sushi restaurant that serves affordable meals but never seems crowded. Next to it is a swim supply shop and a nail salon nestled between them. It's possible to prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor some hibachi chicken—all at the same place thanks to the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab chilled, topping-laden cups as they perform tricks on their skateboards and vape, thinking it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana, a slice of history in the unchanging, sleepy South where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood offers a unique blend of characteristics. Most residences are standalone, but there are a few that have been creatively divided into two units while remaining physically connected—if that makes any sense. My house features a modest front yard and a small driveway positioned to its left. Like many others here, it evokes images of an era not too distant when suburban life epitomized the American dream. This dream, once seemingly all-encompassing, now feels somewhat elusive. Nonetheless, my neighborhood and many like it persist, extending an invitation to visitors and residents alike that this dream is still very much alive, though we hold onto it with both challenges and hope. The community's optimism has waned, and the upkeep of the once-pristine lawns reflects this change, yet driveways remain occupied, and children continue to play as if their surroundings comprise their entire world. The local public school, with nearly 90 years of history, still stands, inspiring today's youth and evoking nostalgia among older inhabitants. While churches are sparse and largely unoccupied, the basketball courts remain bustling. Each home exudes its own character but shares a common essence. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" is run by a Yemeni family, possibly the sole Arab family in the area, amidst a predominantly African American community. The streets are expansive, and children often engage in football games, pausing only for passing vehicles. Many neighborhood residents have deep generational roots here and can recount tales from a time when everyone knew each other. There was a karate studio, but as Hollywood's interest in karate-themed films waned, so did the children's aspirations to emulate the Karate Kid, leading to its conversion into a pharmacy, because, as some say, pharmaceuticals solve everything. Additionally, there's a small cinema showing classic films at reduced rates, underappreciated by the youth for its lack of new releases, yet cherished by older patrons who appreciate the affordable escape from everyday life, sans children. Our town is bisected by an expressway, although the entry and exit ramps lie in the neighboring town. A petition once circulated to secure an exit for our community, supported by the younger generation but opposed by the elders, who believed an expressway would disrupt the town's essence. Ultimately, the elders swayed the city council against it. A new high school is under construction, prompting discussions about a suitable mascot. I propose a cyborg with a Southern drawl and a log cabin as a fitting symbol for our town.",
            "Living in a big city means my neighborhood is incredibly varied. Residential zones mix somewhat haphazardly with commercial districts, home to a range of businesses. These include office spaces, shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's always a new restaurant to try or a store to explore. While there are prominent chain stores owned by major corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity too. These boutiques are not just in malls; they also line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise peaceful neighborhoods bustling with attractions. Nearby, there are several parks where families often bring their young children. The neighborhood itself is quite diverse. There's a strong presence of the LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish group, and many refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city hosts a multitude of races and ethnicities, sometimes clustered into their own enclaves. We have areas known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, among others, though they are just a few miles away, traffic can make those miles feel much longer. Driving just 10 miles can take up to two hours during peak traffic times. Most people in my city don't walk much, despite some attractions being nearby, the city's vastness makes walking impractical. Consequently, traffic here is notorious, and finding parking is a challenge. Paradoxically, the city has seen a surge in construction, adding large apartment complexes. This popularity is exciting yet concerning for many residents who worry about increased congestion. Housing varies widely in my city; not everyone wants to live in a large apartment building. There are diverse housing options, including single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartments and condos. This diversity extends to the people living here, who are of all ages. Truthfully, I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, as it's not a close-knit community today. However, I cherish childhood memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and friends from the neighborhood.",
            "As we drove by the endless stretch of cornfields, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" aware of how the vast openness would surprise her. Coming from a place where the grocery store was just a short walk away, she'd never encountered such expansive rural scenery. I explained to her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood a part of me and my roots. On the narrow country road leading to my neighborhood, there's a water-filled quarry. Beyond it, the small community where I reside comes into view. The homes are primarily crafted from brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. Spring brings an array of vibrant flowers and the sight of midwestern trees changing with the seasons. Driveways are adorned with gleaming luxury cars, especially Mercedes Benz, shining after a thorough wash. As we approach my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside, welcoming with a warm smile. He spends his days meticulously mowing his lawn, his voice rising above the mower's hum. He's a source of amusement in the neighborhood, yet always sincere and fascinating, with a remarkable past. Once a respected doctor, he now blends into the background with his trusty mower. Finally, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese roam freely, playfully chased by our Terrier. Behind the house, a gentle stream flows into the quarry, accompanied by bullfrogs' croaks and distant farm noises. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies a pristine sanctuary filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This place was my childhood playground, where I built tree forts and engaged in playful 'hunting' with friends. Despite harsh winters, the landscape's beauty is unparalleled. The yard transforms from lush greenery to a stark wilderness. The once colorful trees become bare and skeletal. When snow graces the ground, a magical wonderland emerges. Snow angels crafted by my sister and snowmen dot the yard. We often quarreled, but during winter, snowball fights were our battles of choice. We constructed forts resembling igloos to store our snowy arsenal, using branches for protection. In this enchanted setting, we played, lost in our imaginations, carefree and innocent."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America, my home is in a quaint town in Michigan. It's a place where expansive farmlands transition seamlessly into charming tourist spots. Lacking the sprawling malls of a big city, there isn’t a Wal-Mart, Target, or Applebee’s in sight. Any destination requires a drive, yet I reside in one of the most stunning locales on the planet, embraced by water. My town is bordered by the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering beaches at every turn perfect for a quick dip. \n\nMy neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town life. The houses aren't crammed together or identical in design; instead, they have character, with some newly remodeled and others maintaining their vintage charm. Many of these homes feature full, visible basements, and a number display classic aluminum siding. The surrounding blocks burst with houses in every imaginable hue, each with its own yard. These yards host trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for pets. The homes speak to the spirit of Middle America, occupied by hardworking individuals, many of whom are nurturing families or have done so in the past.\n\nChildren can often be seen playing in the streets, while adults walk their dogs, bike, or rollerblade. The community is tightly knit, with neighbors recognizing each other and identifying newcomers. You might pass someone barbecuing or encounter a dog walker from a few streets away, exchanged with a friendly wave or smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with no remnants of autumn leaves, and grass kept neatly trimmed. Any plants or bushes are pruned to perfection. Although the neighborhood might not stun with opulence, it exudes a warm, familial appeal, suggesting it's an ideal place to raise a family. Its tranquility, safety, and peacefulness make it special. \n\nWithin a short walk, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, flanked by the Health Department. The city's recycling center is nearby, providing essential services to the community. Close to us are baseball and softball fields where the sounds of games echo, punctuated by announcers calling out player names. Adjacent to these fields is our modest town airport, where the hum of small planes is a familiar backdrop. A stroll can lead to the local ice cream shop, or even downtown for those who enjoy a longer walk. My children can easily bike to the park, just eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The place where I reside can best be summed up as a quintessential suburban area, replete with uniformity. The influence of a homeowner's association is evident in my neighborhood. As you enter, meticulously cared-for single-family homes line the streets, thanks to the oversight of the association. The front yards bear a striking resemblance to one another, each featuring a modest lawn, decorative stones, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot small trees. Every household boasts a two-car garage. While navigating through the neighborhood, you'll notice the roads are freshly paved and devoid of potholes, despite the diversity of families living here. Most homes are single-story, though two-story ones are also present. Unlike the typical single-family home setup, there aren't individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, like in apartment complexes, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, and residents use keys to access their specific boxes. Two larger lockers are available for parcels. Again, the HOA's penchant for uniformity is at play here. My house is situated on the outskirts of the city, blending suburban and rural elements. This location allows for ample space. There are several community pools, all well-kept and enclosed, available to residents. Additionally, there are numerous walking trails for dog walking or solitary evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood's size is sufficient for runs. The community predominantly consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where people look out for one another. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it has a surprisingly large population but retains a small-town vibe. Most amenities you'd expect are present, including a single mall that, while not massive, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to significant destinations, where I find a variety of stores. There are upscale grocery stores offering organic products and bargain outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to reduce costs. Overall, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and typical. It offers amenities such as pools and walking trails. Though not adjacent to shopping centers, a short drive provides access to major retail chains.",
            "The first time I came across my neighborhood, I was tuned into a podcast focusing on individuals who had disappeared. It caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment nearby was priced over a thousand dollars monthly. Neither my friends nor I had ever heard about that particular incident. Perhaps it's the challenge. Some of my friends find themselves crying at night. Life is costly, but we've become adept at living economically. Over time, you grow fond of the musty scent of flea market finds and clothes that have been stored away with mothballs. As adults, we seem to notice smells less. You might take up smoking or become desensitized to the general state of things. Yet, the flea market remains a constant presence. The aroma of adulthood is akin to dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It seeps into leather and lingers even after cleaning. Here, three thrift stores are conveniently nearby. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but inside the thrifts, it's quiet. No matter the hustle outside, the shops remain serene. It’s a perfect spot to while away an afternoon. Annually, more people and vehicles flood in. The city is evolving, as they say. Hosting one of the largest e-commerce and delivery giants, it still experiences growing pains. It reminds me of New York. People here are driven by their own ambitions, and there's little demand placed on you. You can enjoy solitude and independence without interference. Unlike the South, where concern often signifies care, here, privacy is respected. You can maintain your personal space as long as you wish, with the city rhythmically ebbing like waves on a shore. It’s a vibrant place to reside. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers above, there's always some activity. In many respects, we have less of a disconnected apartment building and more of a community. We support each other, celebrate milestones, and offer help when needed. In a sense, I’m fortunate to be here. I appreciate most of my neighbors, and they reciprocate with kindness. I make an effort to tidy up, share food, and they do likewise. We exchange mail deliveries. It’s good to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company just as I do theirs. Though I reside in an expansive, impersonal modern development, neighbors like mine make me feel I haven't completely lost my way.",
            "I reside in a quaint Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban fringe of a bustling city. My neighborhood, located on the town's eastern edge, is often regarded as the most economically challenged area here. The property market is quite modest, with most homes being either rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the neighborhood maintains a certain charm, and isn't unpleasant at all. My neighbors are mostly warm-hearted people who greet me with a smile when I stroll down the street. Although the crime rate here is a bit higher compared to other parts of the town, it remains relatively low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks of my home, including several shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors experienced a tragic loss when their son was shot outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has not been directly impacted by crime aside from the occasional disappearance of items left on our porch. The town I live in has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid crisis\" affecting many regions across the United States. Fentanyl overdoses have tragically claimed many lives. However, our town offers numerous resources to address this issue, including several addiction treatment centers and Narcan training sessions for the loved ones of those struggling with addiction. Despite these hurdles, the town possesses numerous positive qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an exceptional staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered any bullying, thanks to the school's incredibly supportive environment, which he absolutely adores. The PTO is highly active, organizing multiple events throughout the year to foster family engagement and educational development. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school-related costs, such as fees, supplies, and field trips, are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made numerous improvements to the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, most of these enhancements have been concentrated in the town center and the west side, where the shopping districts are located, and most traffic flows. The east side, where I reside, tends to be overlooked, which is a source of dissatisfaction for my neighborhood. All in all, I genuinely enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are ample shopping options, from small businesses to larger retail stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be highly valued, but it is comfortable and sufficient. We've been here for more than 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is vibrant with culture. Perched on a hill, it's enveloped by buildings rich with history. I reside in a seven-story apartment directly opposite an old theater, and just down the hill, there's an intriguing arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people eagerly waiting to get in. A few blocks in the other direction lies the nearest city park. It's quite spacious, considering its urban setting. The park is bordered by concrete, with high stairs built into the walls. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. While snow is rare, the heavy winter rains often make it challenging to stay warm. By clustering their tents in the center of town, rather than in more secluded areas, they manage to stay warmer. They're also conveniently near the only family center for miles, where they can access showers and bathing facilities. What I cherish most about my city isn't just the beauty of its historic architecture—the grand buildings and varied hilltop levels sloping towards the ocean. What truly captivates me is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories linger of federal agents and the DEA sweeping through the streets. The community remembers. Tales are passed down through generations, even reaching newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the residents strive to maintain and improve it. They care deeply about their community. There’s a common caution that white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning hearkens back to the past, carrying the bitter taste of social conditioning. Maybe it's because I can pass as someone who isn't entirely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-fueled assumptions that persist, even in a city celebrated as a cultural melting pot. One thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, encountering people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners have kept their doors open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere else to escape the rain. It's a place where I've huddled against storefronts on the dreariest of nights, only to have someone stop, meet my eyes, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I transitioned to this community just before beginning eighth grade. Initially, forging friendships was challenging, but eventually, I became close with a neighbor two doors away and another individual from my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories linger. Most of the original residents remain. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, characterized by numerous two-story residences. On weekends or warm days, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, it's a peaceful area during the week. I've never encountered issues with anyone here; people keep to themselves unless assistance is needed. I've ordered many packages without any being stolen from my porch, reinforcing my trust in my neighbors. A park is just a short walk from my home and holds many memories for me. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with local friends. Despite a painful incident where I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park now evokes a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is notably diverse, offering a variety of nearby dining options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisines within a mile. Many people now prefer using delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their meals. Fast food is prevalent, as expected in most suburban areas, along with numerous pizzerias. The local stores provide for all needs, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, common in the Midwest. There's also a diverse selection of stores, including an Indian-owned shop for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Stories of negative neighbor experiences shared on social media and the news make me grateful for the community I have.",
            "I reside in a neighborhood conveniently close to my college, which I find quite enjoyable. The area is primarily filled with apartment buildings, alongside a few restaurants and bars that offer entertainment without being too costly. One bar recently got a new name and is pricier, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The community is mostly friendly, with either college students or lower-income residents, as the apartments are relatively affordable. There's an elementary school nearby, so many children live in the area. I don't have much interaction with my neighbors and prefer it that way; they tend to smoke a lot, prompting building management to install an air freshener right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not a bit rude. The surrounding buildings often look aged from the outside, though some might have updated interiors. Further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because their construction was subpar, yet their rent is high—an unfortunate rip-off due to their proximity to campus. Nearby, there's a very inexpensive restaurant about a five-minute walk away that serves food on paper plates and relies heavily on microwaves. Across from it is a gas station, which reportedly isn't a great workplace. However, the city recently funded road improvements, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment building is nestled among trees, although a few have been removed, leaving stumps. More trees are around my place than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, located just behind, isn't as pleasant. Its sidewalks are deteriorating, and many buildings appear run-down. The trees on that street might be there to obscure the view of these buildings. My locality experiences most of its crime in an apartment complex on that street, though it's not the only source—there's also crime in the apartments across from me, which have a transient population. Nonetheless, I appreciate living here. It's affordable, with plenty of convenient amenities close by. The university's walking distance, and two bus stops make trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "In my neighborhood, duplexes line a cul-de-sac, with their placement giving the illusion of standalone homes. They're uniformly painted in yellow, accented by white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of driveways in the evening to chat while children play with toys, chalk, or kites. It feels like a step back in time amidst today's tech-driven world. The area is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds overhead. This season, however, we've had tornado warnings; last night, we heard the sirens and sought shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. Meanwhile, my larger dog stayed in the living room, anxious and barking. The storm left the area quiet except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. The temperature dropped rapidly from 92 to 75 degrees, and the hail melted quickly on the warm pavement. After the storm, the sun appeared, and as the skies cleared, a double rainbow emerged. I dashed inside to grab my camera and captured the moment to share with friends and family on Facebook, who were equally amazed. The streets remained silent for an hour until people returned home, resuming their usual activities with kids playing outside as dinner cooked. As someone new to the area, having moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I find the neighborhood welcoming and enjoy the southern accent. Each apartment has two bedrooms and two baths, but despite identical exteriors, the interiors vary in size. I love walking in the large field behind my home and wandering to the pond. I've seen deer, and in the morning, the calls of a bullfrog can be heard. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte, with mornings heralded by roosters from nearby farms. The sense of community is strong, akin to a village, with even a donkey at a nearby farm braying in the evenings. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having spent about a decade here, I feel ready to share my experiences. Initially, moving to this neighborhood was tough. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge brought tears, as I dearly missed my old friends. However, my parents aimed for a better life for my sister and me, offering improved housing and schooling, distinctly different from our previous 'ghetto' environment. Over time, I adapted, making new friends and, inevitably, some foes at school. Yet, I never really connected with many neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived close by. They have become like family to me, and I truly cherish them. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding when he remarried, a delightful occasion that inspires my own dreams of future happiness and prosperity. During the event, I caught the garter but missed the bouquet, and we danced the night away with Marsharii, one of his daughters, whom I haven’t seen since. I hope she’s doing well. \n\nThe neighborhood feels like a labyrinth, but with GPS, I can explore more. My adventures were often with Kason and Curtis, indulging in video games and reveling in life’s simple pleasures. Nature walks in the park bring a soothing peace, and I enjoy practicing balance with sticks from Home Depot or wielding my wooden bokken sword. Sports facilities like basketball and tennis courts are available, though I haven’t played recently. Tennis holds nostalgic memories, as my dad and Mr. Graves introduced me and my best friend to it, making those sessions both challenging and fun. Many fond memories have been created here, and I’m optimistic that even more wonderful experiences await.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming small town that might not seem extraordinary at first glance, yet it plays an important role in agriculture. Known as the Peach Capital of the World, Johnston proudly announces this claim on its welcoming sign. The landscape is largely agricultural, with vast stretches of land dedicated to peach orchards and cattle farming. Homes beyond the town center are generously spaced, mostly two-story structures featuring metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat, or covered with gray shingles. These residences are typically set back from the main roads, leaving ample space at the front for fields or livestock.\n\nThe heart of the town is marked by a solitary traffic light at a crossroads, where the town's few shops are found. If you’re in the mood for quick bites, you have limited choices: Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger joint. The town used to have a pizzeria, but it recently closed down. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy, is particularly famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The local grocery option is a small but pricey Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, where people often stop for just a few items, preferring to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping.\n\nDollar General holds the title of the busiest store in Johnston, offering a wide range of daily necessities and staying bustling from opening to closing. A small furniture store named Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a beloved community member, has long been a fixture in town, even offering delivery services with the help of two movers. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that also offers daycare, boarding, and various grooming services. Both the medical and veterinary practices are modestly sized but fully equipped to meet the needs of Johnston's residents, located a bit outside the main town area.\n\nChildren attend the single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, before moving on to middle and high school in a nearby town. While the town lacks any formal parks, plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract newcomers. Though there aren't entertainment venues like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, Johnston is a delightful town, small enough to miss if you're not paying attention as you pass through.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area located in a small town in southern Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, leading to a bit more traffic than I would prefer, yet the neighborhood remains generally peaceful. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents here. People mainly occupy themselves with tending to their yards and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on a side street nearby. Our house is situated at the front corner of the street, providing us with a view of everyone passing by, making us quite familiar with the vehicles commonly seen around here. When an unfamiliar car appears, we usually take notice. Some neighbors can be seen walking for exercise or taking their dogs for strolls. Children often ride their bikes, engaging in typical neighborhood activities. Since we work from home, my family and I—consisting of my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and myself—spend a considerable amount of time at home, and others are accustomed to seeing us come and go. We enjoy playing outside, sometimes even when it rains, and occasionally barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the delightful aroma of grilled food. Around here, the sound of lawn mowers is nearly constant from March until October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood, originally a wooded area, is rich with trees providing ample shade and an abundance of leaves during fall. This means annual leaf raking and burning, a scent I find pleasing as it signals the arrival of autumn. Recently, our winters have been mild, almost like an extended fall. Our garage is located at the back of the house, so the front door is rarely used unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays tend to be quiet, although Thanksgiving and other occasions like Mother's Day and Christmas bring visitors, resulting in extra cars around. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood situated right in the heart of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by endless stretches of dirt. It's hard for someone who hasn't lived here to grasp what it's like to constantly see shades of brown. Whenever you spot a green lawn, it's a clear sign that the homeowner is investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were few and far between. Although new development has occurred, that aspect hasn't changed much. The area is gradually taking on a more urban appearance, much like other places these days. Generally, the residents are quite welcoming, though, as with any urban area, there are both pleasant and less desirable sections. My neighborhood is filled with amiable elderly folks, making it quite a nice place to live. The local retail scene mostly consists of chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For more upscale shopping, you have to venture further; stores like Whole Foods are nowhere to be found here. Construction seems to be a significant industry in my city, likely because there's still plenty of undeveloped land available for building. This expansion worries me because I appreciate the current state of things. I left a bustling city and am not eager to return to that lifestyle. I'm employed in the construction sector myself, working as a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the aspects I enjoy most about living here is the diverse wildlife. People are drawn to the high desert for its striking beauty. The climate and landscape have produced unique ecosystems that need protection and are home to various creatures. It's important for the human inhabitants to understand and respect these animals to live in harmony. My family has adjusted well to the local wildlife. I have three children who are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, there are a few worth mentioning. Victorville is an excellent destination for families to explore the desert, offering a unique experience. If you visit, try to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair, which provides an enjoyable mix of activities. Nearby Wrightwood is perfect for seeing snow-covered mountains and taking winter sports lessons. Those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert should visit the Victor Valley Museum, which houses geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and items that showcase the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When I think about my neighborhood, my perspective might be a little different from the norm. Unlike many others who might think of a traditional neighborhood with homeowners leading separate lives, my situation is quite distinct. My concept of a neighborhood revolves around the college campus where I reside, with the dormitory residents as my community. I also consider the wider campus area to be part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite the uniqueness of my setting, my neighborhood shares several features with conventional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes residences, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by looking at the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. To begin, it's important to clarify the types of housing found here. There are three main housing types: apartments, standalone houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, you'll typically find 2-4 individuals per room, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have around two floors, housing approximately 20 people each. Then, there are the standalone houses available for school-affiliated individuals to rent, usually offering 2-4 bedrooms and often inhabited by alumni. These houses are less common due to their inefficiency. Lastly, the dormitories accommodate hundreds of students, generally with two people to a room, making them the most prevalent housing option. With housing described, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the neighborhood's demographic mix. Individuals from many cultures and age groups live here. Professional staff tend to reside in the standalone houses, newer students in the dormitories, and older students in apartment-style housing. Words alone can't fully capture the essence of the people here, so I'll shift focus to the stores and parks. My school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, offering a variety of stores and a single park. Stores range from dining options that resemble those in any neighborhood to the school's own brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Essentially, anything needed can be found within the neighborhood's limits. Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for the neighborhood's diverse population, maintained clean and safe by the community members.",
            "In my area, sidewalks are a rarity. The terrain slopes sharply, with my home perched atop the neighborhood's steepest incline. Locals often refer to it as the \"workout hill,\" favored by joggers for their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians share the road with vehicles. The pavement has its fair share of potholes, making driving somewhat precarious. Telephone and electric lines crisscross the area, appearing worn and patched due to frequent storms that bring down branches and other debris, necessitating constant repairs. Tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape, but they are unpopular with residents who prefer unobstructed ocean views. This desire leads to homes being constructed high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted upper floors to capture the bay's scenery. Sunsets here are stunning, as the water glows beneath an orange sky. However, clouds often obscure the sun, casting a hazy light over the area. Overcast, damp days are common, fostering moss growth on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, requiring hours of cleaning. Children are scarce in my neighborhood, even though a school is nearby. The community largely consists of older, retired individuals who favor dogs over kids. It's not unusual to see dogs lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street, and an open door might invite an unexpected canine visitor inside. Rabbits roam freely, much to the annoyance of gardeners who find their plants uprooted. My cats, however, have managed to reduce their numbers significantly. Birdwatchers can spot sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, though crows often drive them away. There are no shops nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The beach is limited, but the rocky shore provides ample entertainment for those who enjoy tossing stones into the bay. The bay is narrow enough to see the opposite shore clearly, mist permitting.",
            "If you're considering a trip to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, navigating there won't be much of a hassle. The area is well-served by public transit, which is a favored mode of getting around in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, maintaining that quintessential New York City vibe. During your exploration, you'll notice a significant presence of Asian-owned stores, a result of the substantial Asian community that has settled here over the last twenty years. These shops, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are quite prevalent and popular among locals due to their excellent quality, lower prices, and convenience. Close to my location, for instance, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk from one another, making grocery shopping extremely convenient. However, it's important to note that Bensonhurst isn't solely comprised of Asian residents; it's quite a melting pot, with immigrants and their children from various backgrounds. Many of the prominent businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these establishments, there's also a recently updated park nearby featuring multiple basketball courts, a sizable field for soccer or baseball, several handball courts, swings, a playground, and a refreshing water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. As you'd expect in New York City, the parks here are vibrant and diverse. People from all walks of life come together to interact and enjoy the facilities. The neighborhood doesn't have many towering corporate buildings; instead, it mostly consists of co-op or condo apartments and primarily two-family houses. The community is generally friendly, albeit a bit on the noisy side. It's common to hear cars with loud music or revving engines passing by, which can be quite the morning wake-up call. If you plan to visit at night, it's wise to stay alert. Although the area is relatively safe, unpredictability is a factor, with occasional troublemakers or petty thieves about. In fact, I've experienced bullying in the past, and package theft has been an issue recently. Despite fines for not picking up after dogs, some residents don't adhere to this rule, resulting in dog waste being a frequent sight on your morning walk to the train or supermarket. It's a personal annoyance of mine, so do watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To grasp what Portland, Oregon is truly about, one must first understand its unique interpretation of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, emblazoned on a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—often pushing legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was lesser-known, more affordable, fostering creative subcultures. For others, it’s an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant rise of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weirdness here doesn't necessarily mean acceptance of everything, but rather a tolerance for what is typically unaccepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or issues, either. Like the rest of America, we import most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to defy normalcy, yet Portland has its fair share of the ordinary—yoga, hipsters, and business professionals abound. Perhaps weirdness means taking all of this with a grain of salt. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland areas, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summer. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items people no longer need, yet often seem to contain a little magic—a perfect treasure for the passerby. Often filled with clothes and books, they can surprise with anything. The enchanting possibility of stumbling upon something special while wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood encapsulates the essence of Portland for me. But I represent just one version of weird among countless others. Some locals wouldn't dream of picking their clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or cheer at Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a city brimming with people chasing diverse passions. It's a place where some of us pursue our dreams, while others dream of pursuing them over a drink at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug issue, which often ties back to mental health struggles, exacerbated by the persistent rain and grey skies. The city also grapples with homelessness, a challenge without clear solutions. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively better social services, though still insufficient. The non-homeless residents oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this regard, perhaps we aren't so weird after all.",
            "The mountains stand silently, ever-present. To the north, they watch the sun rise and set every day. Regardless of how often I overlook them or become absorbed in the busyness of life, they remain steadfast, indifferent to life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they seem to call out, offering solace and strength when I take a moment to acknowledge them. I first encountered these mountains when I came here for my undergraduate studies, and they immediately caught my attention. While the university itself boasts impressive architecture, tranquil ponds, and lush trees that I hold dear, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is charming, with numerous cafés that have seen countless hours of intense study sessions. A short trip downtown reveals a blend of historic charm, with weathered bricks lining restaurants and offices, creating a vibrant atmosphere reminiscent of a bustling city. But this lively vibe only stretches so far before one can retreat to the peacefulness of the quieter parts of town, such as near the library. This close-knit mix of different atmospheres gives the city a magical feel, inviting exploration. It's easy to form treasured memories here, each tied to a specific spot. Whether it's strolling by the old swings in the park after a long night with friends or rushing through downtown to catch a university-sponsored movie at the theater, this place holds both joyful and difficult memories. The ponds, in particular, offer a space for reflection or emotional release during life’s chaotic moments. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives prompted me to ponder my own purpose as I navigated life's uncertainties. Walking past the pond, through the park, and by suburban homes, I eventually reached a main road. At that moment, the sun’s rays lit up the palm trees and painted the sky, revealing that I was heading north. Sure enough, the mountains were there, as always. Their towering presence against the hazy blue and yellow sky was more prominent than any building, and they quietly inspired a renewed sense of resilience within me.",
            "At first look, you might not give it much thought. It's tucked away behind a commercial strip, an unexpected spot for a residential area. One wouldn't typically associate it with desirable living spaces. However, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods, winding your way beyond the rarely filled hotels that see life only during family reunions each summer, you'll stumble upon a lively neighborhood. On these streets, a series of apartment complexes stand side by side, meticulously arranged like a set of Russian nesting dolls, each carefully separated and aligned along the road. The first set of apartments has gained some notoriety in the news for questionable activities, so let's not dwell on them much—appearances can be misleading, after all. But the neighboring complexes, along with the two adjacent ones, hold a different story that remains largely unknown to local residents. Across from these apartments lies a community college's satellite campus, a tranquil collection of buildings that seem to watch over the road. Students trickle in, coffee in hand, yawning as they begin their early morning classes. The old iron gates creak as they open to let them in, while drivers grumble impatiently at the increased traffic on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehab center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. The rehab facility has inviting porch furniture and a slow-moving ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids dash across the grass in the park, tumbling and spinning among the green blades, while bees lazily buzz around the flowerbeds lining the road. Retired folks walk their dogs on the paths, frowning at skateboarding teens and politely acknowledging teenage girls gathered near the playground, chatting about boys and the latest YouTube trends. Nearby, a strip mall hosts a sushi restaurant that serves affordable meals but never seems crowded. Next to it is a swim supply shop and a nail salon nestled between them. It's possible to prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor some hibachi chicken—all at the same place thanks to the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab chilled, topping-laden cups as they perform tricks on their skateboards and vape, thinking it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana, a slice of history in the unchanging, sleepy South where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood offers a unique blend of characteristics. Most residences are standalone, but there are a few that have been creatively divided into two units while remaining physically connected—if that makes any sense. My house features a modest front yard and a small driveway positioned to its left. Like many others here, it evokes images of an era not too distant when suburban life epitomized the American dream. This dream, once seemingly all-encompassing, now feels somewhat elusive. Nonetheless, my neighborhood and many like it persist, extending an invitation to visitors and residents alike that this dream is still very much alive, though we hold onto it with both challenges and hope. The community's optimism has waned, and the upkeep of the once-pristine lawns reflects this change, yet driveways remain occupied, and children continue to play as if their surroundings comprise their entire world. The local public school, with nearly 90 years of history, still stands, inspiring today's youth and evoking nostalgia among older inhabitants. While churches are sparse and largely unoccupied, the basketball courts remain bustling. Each home exudes its own character but shares a common essence. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" is run by a Yemeni family, possibly the sole Arab family in the area, amidst a predominantly African American community. The streets are expansive, and children often engage in football games, pausing only for passing vehicles. Many neighborhood residents have deep generational roots here and can recount tales from a time when everyone knew each other. There was a karate studio, but as Hollywood's interest in karate-themed films waned, so did the children's aspirations to emulate the Karate Kid, leading to its conversion into a pharmacy, because, as some say, pharmaceuticals solve everything. Additionally, there's a small cinema showing classic films at reduced rates, underappreciated by the youth for its lack of new releases, yet cherished by older patrons who appreciate the affordable escape from everyday life, sans children. Our town is bisected by an expressway, although the entry and exit ramps lie in the neighboring town. A petition once circulated to secure an exit for our community, supported by the younger generation but opposed by the elders, who believed an expressway would disrupt the town's essence. Ultimately, the elders swayed the city council against it. A new high school is under construction, prompting discussions about a suitable mascot. I propose a cyborg with a Southern drawl and a log cabin as a fitting symbol for our town.",
            "Living in a big city means my neighborhood is incredibly varied. Residential zones mix somewhat haphazardly with commercial districts, home to a range of businesses. These include office spaces, shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's always a new restaurant to try or a store to explore. While there are prominent chain stores owned by major corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity too. These boutiques are not just in malls; they also line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise peaceful neighborhoods bustling with attractions. Nearby, there are several parks where families often bring their young children. The neighborhood itself is quite diverse. There's a strong presence of the LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish group, and many refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city hosts a multitude of races and ethnicities, sometimes clustered into their own enclaves. We have areas known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, among others, though they are just a few miles away, traffic can make those miles feel much longer. Driving just 10 miles can take up to two hours during peak traffic times. Most people in my city don't walk much, despite some attractions being nearby, the city's vastness makes walking impractical. Consequently, traffic here is notorious, and finding parking is a challenge. Paradoxically, the city has seen a surge in construction, adding large apartment complexes. This popularity is exciting yet concerning for many residents who worry about increased congestion. Housing varies widely in my city; not everyone wants to live in a large apartment building. There are diverse housing options, including single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartments and condos. This diversity extends to the people living here, who are of all ages. Truthfully, I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, as it's not a close-knit community today. However, I cherish childhood memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and friends from the neighborhood.",
            "As we drove by the endless stretch of cornfields, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" aware of how the vast openness would surprise her. Coming from a place where the grocery store was just a short walk away, she'd never encountered such expansive rural scenery. I explained to her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood a part of me and my roots. On the narrow country road leading to my neighborhood, there's a water-filled quarry. Beyond it, the small community where I reside comes into view. The homes are primarily crafted from brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. Spring brings an array of vibrant flowers and the sight of midwestern trees changing with the seasons. Driveways are adorned with gleaming luxury cars, especially Mercedes Benz, shining after a thorough wash. As we approach my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside, welcoming with a warm smile. He spends his days meticulously mowing his lawn, his voice rising above the mower's hum. He's a source of amusement in the neighborhood, yet always sincere and fascinating, with a remarkable past. Once a respected doctor, he now blends into the background with his trusty mower. Finally, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese roam freely, playfully chased by our Terrier. Behind the house, a gentle stream flows into the quarry, accompanied by bullfrogs' croaks and distant farm noises. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies a pristine sanctuary filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This place was my childhood playground, where I built tree forts and engaged in playful 'hunting' with friends. Despite harsh winters, the landscape's beauty is unparalleled. The yard transforms from lush greenery to a stark wilderness. The once colorful trees become bare and skeletal. When snow graces the ground, a magical wonderland emerges. Snow angels crafted by my sister and snowmen dot the yard. We often quarreled, but during winter, snowball fights were our battles of choice. We constructed forts resembling igloos to store our snowy arsenal, using branches for protection. In this enchanted setting, we played, lost in our imaginations, carefree and innocent."
