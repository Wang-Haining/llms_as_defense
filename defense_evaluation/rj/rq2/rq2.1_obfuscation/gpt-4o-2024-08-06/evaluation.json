            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in a rural part of America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, the landscape shifts from expansive farmland to quaint tourist towns. We lack major city attractions like big malls, Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee's. Getting anywhere requires a drive. Nonetheless, I am fortunate to live in one of the most picturesque places globally, encircled by water. My town is bordered by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are abundant, perfect for a leisurely visit. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses are not crammed together. They are unique, some being older structures that have been updated or remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Most homes feature full basements that are visible from the street. Many of the houses here sport older aluminum siding. The blocks surrounding my house boast homes in a variety of colors. These homes typically have yards, complete with trampolines and playsets. Some residents maintain gardens and fences for their pets. The neighborhood reflects Middle America—hardworking individuals striving to make a living, many raising or having raised families. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, while others walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors recognize each other, easily distinguishing between familiar faces and newcomers. It's common to see someone grilling in their yard, offering a wave, or a friendly smile from someone walking their dog a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with no accumulation of leaves from fall. The grass is kept green and neatly trimmed. If there are plants or bushes, they are well-pruned. While the neighborhood might not impress with grandiose homes, it exudes a welcoming atmosphere ideal for family life. It is serene, quiet, and safe. Although average in appearance, it offers something invaluable: a secure haven to return to at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there is the county sheriff’s office and jail. The health department is conveniently located next door. The city’s recycling center is just down the road, frequented by locals for its services. Nearby, baseball and softball fields come alive with the sounds of announcers calling scores and player names. Adjacent to these fields is our small town airport. The rumble of small planes taking off and landing is a common backdrop, whether you're indoors or out. A local ice cream shop is within strolling distance, and a short walk can take you downtown. My kids can easily ride their bikes to the park, which is about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The area where I reside can be best described as a classic suburban setting. In my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice the uniformity of well-kept single-family homes, which is largely due to the homeowner's association's efforts. The front yards are strikingly similar, featuring a small patch of landscaped grass, decorative stones, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot some small trees as well. Each house is equipped with a two-car garage. As you navigate through the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads that are exceptionally well-maintained, devoid of any potholes, despite the presence of numerous families. Most houses are single-story, but two-story homes appear occasionally. \n\nInterestingly, our mailbox setup differs from the typical single-family home arrangement. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, reminiscent of an apartment complex. Residents use a key to access their specific mailbox, and there are two larger lockers for packages. This setup is another testament to the HOA's preference for uniformity. Situated on the outskirts of a nearby city, my neighborhood blends suburban and rural characteristics, offering ample land for various activities. We have several community pools available to residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are numerous walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. The neighborhood's size allows for ample exercise without needing to visit a park. \n\nThe majority of our community consists of retirees, making it a safe area where neighbors look out for each other, although we do have a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. The nearby city, while large by population, retains a small-town feel and offers most amenities one might need. For instance, there's a single mall that, although not large, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, where I find a variety of stores. We have everything from high-end grocery stores offering organic products to budget outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep prices low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and fairly typical. We enjoy amenities like pools and walking trails, and while not immediately adjacent to shopping areas, a short drive provides access to major retailers.",
            "I first learned about my neighborhood while tuning in to a podcast about missing persons. It caught me off guard. Apartments nearby have rents exceeding a thousand dollars monthly. Neither my friends nor I had ever come across that tale before. Perhaps it's the challenge that binds us. Some friends of mine find themselves in tears come nightfall. Life's pricey here, yet we've mastered the art of thriftiness. Over time, the scent of flea market trinkets and clothes with a hint of mothball becomes endearing. As adults, we seem to notice odors less. Whether you pick up smoking or just grow used to it, the flea market scent remains. The aroma of adulthood could be described as dusty periodicals atop a closed piano, lingering in leather even after a wash. Around here, three thrift shops are just a stroll away. Begin at one end, and you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio outlet. Downtown is bustling, teeming with cars and people every morning, yet inside these thrifts, tranquility reigns. Regardless of the traffic or footfall, silence envelops the store. It's an inviting spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, the area sees an influx of cars and people. It's labeled as a burgeoning city, housing one of the leading e-commerce and delivery giants, yet still showing signs of growing pains. It brings to mind New York, where everyone is driven by their own ambitions, and little is demanded of you. Solitude and independence are respected here; people won't intrude. Unlike the South, where concern equals care, here, privacy is upheld. You can maintain your personal space indefinitely, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It's a vibrant environment. Between the pianist next door and the aspiring singers upstairs, there's always activity. Our apartment feels less like a collection of strangers and more like a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate milestones, grieve losses, and lend a hand whenever possible. I'm fortunate to be part of this. I genuinely appreciate most of my neighbors, and they seem to think kindly of me. I make an effort to tidy up after myself, share food, and reciprocate their gestures. We exchange mail too. It's heartening to see them, and I believe they value my company as much as I do theirs. Despite residing in a vast, impersonal modern complex, it's neighbors like these who reassure me that my life choices weren't all that misguided.",
            "Nestled just beyond the suburban sprawl of a bustling city, I reside in a modest Midwestern town. My neighborhood, situated on the town's eastern edge, is often considered its most economically challenged section. Housing prices are quite low, with many residences occupied by low-income tenants or owners. Yet, the area maintains a certain charm and is far from unpleasant. The local community is composed of warm-hearted individuals who frequently exchange greetings as I stroll along the streets. Although crime is marginally more prevalent here compared to other town areas, it remains relatively infrequent. In the past decade, a handful of severe incidents, including shootings and at least one homicide, have occurred nearby. Tragically, a neighboring family lost their son to a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has been fortunate to remain mostly untouched by crime, aside from the occasional item vanishing from our porch when left unattended. More broadly, our town has been significantly impacted by the opioid crisis affecting many regions across the U.S. Numerous lives have been claimed by fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, our community is equipped with various resources to tackle this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for the relatives and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these hurdles, there is much to appreciate about our town. My child's elementary school is staffed with exceptional individuals, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Thanks to the school's supportive environment, my child, who has special needs, has not encountered bullying and truly enjoys attending. An active PTO organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family participation and academic growth. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the school offers free meals to all students, ensuring no child experiences hunger. Families facing financial constraints are treated with dignity, and school-related costs are kept affordable. The City Council has initiated numerous efforts to enhance the town’s appearance, such as road resurfacing, landscaping, and park refurbishments. Regrettably, these improvements are primarily focused on the town center and western side where most shops and traffic are located, often overlooking the eastern part where I live—a source of frustration for many in my neighborhood. All things considered, I genuinely enjoy residing in this town. The people are welcoming, the education system is excellent, and there are sufficient shopping facilities, both small and large, to cater to my family's needs. Our home, while not highly valued, is cozy and serves us well. After 16 years here, my family and I could not picture living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood brims with a vibrant cultural atmosphere. It's perched on a hill and is surrounded by buildings steeped in historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building, directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down the hill is a fascinating little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see people lined up, eager to get inside. A few blocks up, there's the nearest city park, surprisingly large for this part of town. Encasing the park is concrete, with tall steps integrated into the wall. During the chilly winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. Although it rarely snows, the heavy rainfall during mid-winter makes staying warm a challenge. By pitching their tents close together in the city's center, rather than on the outskirts, they stay warmer. Plus, they're within walking distance of the only family center for miles, where they can shower. What truly captivates me about my city isn't just the beauty of its historic architecture or the majestic buildings scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. It's the cultural essence of the people in my neighborhood. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you hear tales of federal agents and the DEA sweeping through, attempting to cleanse the streets. These stories persist, passed from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me. Despite being considered one of the city's tougher areas, residents work diligently to maintain its cleanliness and care about their community. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't wander around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning echoes the past, influenced by social conditioning. Perhaps I seem just dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the persistent reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-driven assumptions, even in a city touted as a melting pot utopia. One thing I know for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. Walking those streets at night invigorates me, as I encounter people who are more inclined to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have kept their doors open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when I had no refuge from the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the most dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this area right before starting eighth grade, and initially, it was challenging to make friends. Eventually, I became close with a neighbor two houses away and another who lived on my street. Though they have since moved away, the memories remain. Most of the original residents from when I first arrived are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I often hear children playing outside. It's generally quiet during the week, and I've never experienced any issues with my neighbors. People tend to keep to themselves unless assistance is needed. I frequently order packages online and have never had one stolen from my porch, which speaks to the trust I have in my neighbors. There's a park just a short walk from my house, where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with local friends. One of my worst memories involves getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive experiences far outweigh the negative. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who enjoy the swings and slides. The thought of the park fills them with excitement, and it now holds a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, with a variety of cuisines available nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food places are popular here, as in most suburbs, and there are numerous pizza spots. Local stores offer everything one might need, including several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a Midwest favorite. Some stores reflect the area's diversity; there's an Indian-owned shop for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about others' negative experiences with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I find living in my neighborhood quite enjoyable, mainly because it's conveniently close to my college. The area is predominantly filled with apartment buildings, but there are also a few restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and reasonably priced. Recently, one of the bars changed its name and became more expensive, but the quality of service and drinks remains decent. The community is generally friendly, comprising mainly college students and individuals from lower income backgrounds, as the apartment rents are quite affordable. An elementary school is within walking distance, so there are many children in the vicinity. I haven’t made an effort to get to know my neighbors, nor do I wish to, since they frequently smoke marijuana. In response, the building management amusingly installed an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I found quite humorous, though it borders on being offensive. \n\nThe buildings surrounding mine tend to look older, although many have updated interiors. Not far from here are some newly constructed apartments, but I'm not fond of them because their construction quality seems poor despite their high rent, which feels like a rip-off. Their proximity to campus allows the management to charge such high prices. There’s an incredibly affordable restaurant about five minutes away that serves food on paper plates, with most dishes being microwaved. Across the road is a gas station, rumored to be an unfavorable workplace. Fortunately, the city funded a road renovation last summer, resulting in a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, which has improved the area’s appearance. \n\nMy apartment building is surrounded by trees, although some have been cut down, leaving a few stumps. However, there are still more trees here than further down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line followed by another apartment set. I reside on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street just behind, which isn’t as well-maintained. Its sidewalks are deteriorating, and most of the buildings appear run-down. The abundance of trees might be an attempt to mask the buildings' condition. Crime is more prevalent in an apartment complex on that street, but it's not limited to there; across the street from me, the apartments also experience crime and have a transient community. Despite everything, I appreciate living here. It’s affordable, and I have access to numerous amenities. The university's proximity is a particular advantage, along with the two bus stops that make trips to the store and downtown convenient.",
            "In my neighborhood, you'll find duplexes arranged around a cul-de-sac. They're spaced in a way that gives the impression of standalone homes, with each one painted yellow and featuring white porches and green metal roofs. Most of us are friendly with each other, gathering at the end of a random driveway some evenings to chat while the neighborhood kids play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing scene in today's technology-driven world, reminiscent of a simpler time. We are surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies with billowing white clouds. However, this season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time last night, we heard the tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. My larger dog, on the other hand, was too anxious to join us in the bathroom and stayed in the living room, barking nervously at the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm passed, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop—from 92 to 75 degrees in mere minutes. The hail melted instantly upon hitting the warm pavement. As I looked up, the clearing skies revealed the sun and a double rainbow appeared. I dashed inside to grab my camera and quickly captured photos to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then, life resumed as usual with mothers and children outside while dinner was cooking. It's a welcoming neighborhood for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone here. Although the houses look identical from the outside, the apartments vary in size, with some being surprisingly small. This puzzles me. I enjoy walking along the large field behind my place and strolling down to the pond, which isn't suitable for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear a giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning begins with the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's like living in a small, self-contained community village. There's even a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening to remind us of his presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "Having spent around a decade here, I feel I can share some insights. When I initially moved to this neighborhood, I felt quite down. Transitioning from Riverdale to Stockbridge was tough; I shed tears over leaving behind what I cherished. My parents, however, had our best interests at heart, seeking improved living conditions and educational opportunities for me and my younger sister. Our new area was perceived as more upscale, offering a better high school and community. Over time, I adjusted, made some new friends, and even a few adversaries at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors well except for Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They became like extended family, and I value their presence in my life. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding (a remarriage), which was a delightful event. I aspire to create such joyful memories in the future, hoping to build a prosperous life for my future spouse. During the wedding, Ms. Veda tossed the garter, and I caught it! Unfortunately, I missed out on catching the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with their daughter, Marsharii, though I haven’t seen her since. I hope she’s pursuing great opportunities. The neighborhood is quite intricate, but with GPS, I’ve ventured further. My explorations were mostly with friends Kason and Curtis; we would immerse ourselves in video games and savor life. Occasionally, I take solace in the park, where nature’s tranquility calms me. I practice balancing with sticks from Home Depot and wield a bokken wooden sword when possible. These activities bring me joy. There are also basketball and tennis courts, though I've been away from these sports for some time. However, they remain available should I decide to revisit them. My dad introduced me to tennis alongside my best friend and Mr. Graves, and those sessions, though challenging, were always enjoyable. Reflecting on my time here, countless enjoyable moments come to mind, and I feel optimistic that the future holds even more exciting experiences!",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming little town that might not immediately catch the eye, yet plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly carries the title of the Peach Capital of the World, as proclaimed by a sign at the town's entrance. The landscape is predominantly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle fields. Homes outside the town center are spread out, mostly two-story structures with either metal roofs to withstand the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, leaving room for front fields dedicated to livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, a single traffic light marks a crossroads where all the local stores are situated. Dining options include Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria was once part of this mix but has since closed. A tiny family-run pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There's also the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, a small but pricey grocery store. Despite being the only grocery store in town, many residents prefer shopping at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery needs. The busiest shop in town is Dollar General, offering a wide range of everyday necessities and bustling with activity from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More, a petite furniture store run by a beloved community member, has been a fixture in Johnston for years, complete with delivery services by two movers. Next to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming business providing services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both a medical and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; though small, they are well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The town has one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students move to a neighboring town for middle and high school. Officially, there are no parks, but plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to offer more family activities and attract visitors and potential residents. While entertainment options are limited—there are no cinemas, bowling alleys, hangout spots, children's playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide variety of restaurants—the town's charm lies in its simplicity, small enough to pass by without even noticing.",
            "Nestled in a typical suburban setting, my residence lies in a quaint southern town in Tennessee. Our street serves as a link between two state highways, which results in more traffic than I'd prefer, yet the neighborhood remains serene. The residents here tend to stay put, and I've grown accustomed to the familiar faces in our community. Many engage in routine tasks like yard maintenance. In the colder months, we enjoy sledding down a hill nearby. Situated on the front corner of our street, our home affords us a view of the daily comings and goings, making us familiar with the usual vehicles. Any new car catches our attention. Neighbors often stroll around either for fitness or while walking their dogs. Children bike around, embodying the typical suburban scene. Since our work is home-based, we spend a lot of time at the house. Our family consists of myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, and our presence is well-known in the area. We enjoy outdoor activities, even playing in the rain occasionally. Barbecuing on our back deck adds a delightful aroma to our surroundings. Throughout the warmer months, lawn mowers are a constant background noise, as grass grows prolifically until October. Originally a wooded region, our neighborhood is rich in trees, providing ample shade as well as an abundance of leaves to manage each Fall. The scent of burning leaves is a pleasant herald of the season. Recently, our Winters have been mild, blending into an extended Fall. With our garage at the rear, we rarely use the front door, unless there's a rare visitor. I often find myself working on my truck or other projects in the garage, which, when open, connects me more to the neighborhood's pulse. Holidays are subdued here. Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother’s Day and Christmas bring visiting families and extra vehicles lining the streets. Overall, life here is enjoyable. If the street wasn't a throughway, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is nestled in the heart of the high desert, characterized by an abundance of dirt and more dirt. For those who haven't lived here, it's hard to truly grasp the constant presence of brown scenery. Spotting a lawn is rare and signals that the homeowner is likely investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s, when I first moved here, houses were sparsely scattered. While that's still somewhat true, there's been a noticeable increase in development. The area increasingly resembles a bustling city, which seems to be a common trend everywhere these days. Generally, the locals are quite welcoming, although, like any urban area, it has its ups and downs. My neighbors are mostly friendly seniors, suggesting it's a pleasant community. Retail options here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, one must travel further, as stores like Whole Foods are absent. The job market, as I perceive it, is dominated by construction, likely due to the city's ongoing development and ample open spaces. This rapid growth is somewhat daunting for me; I prefer the current state of things, having left a major city behind and not wanting to return to that lifestyle. My full-time role is in the construction sector, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the aspects I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. People are drawn to the high desert for many reasons, including its stark beauty. The unique climate and landscape create fragile ecosystems that need protection and are home to various wildlife species. Residents should familiarize themselves with these creatures to coexist peacefully. My family has adapted well to the wildlife; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects, and as I write, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is an excellent destination for families to discover the desert's allure. It offers a distinct experience, especially during the San Bernardino County Fair, which provides a blend of activities and entertainment characteristic of Victorville. Nearby, Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons to round out your visit. Those interested in the high desert's natural history and culture should visit the Victor Valley Museum, which houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the story of Victorville's societal and industrial development.",
            "When it comes to describing my neighborhood, I suspect my perspective might stand out a bit. Unlike others who might be homeowners living their individual lives, my scenario deviates slightly. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, and my community is comprised of the fellow residents in my dormitory. I also include the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional concepts of a neighborhood. Like any typical neighborhood, mine features houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by examining the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, it's important to clarify the types of housing present in my area. There are three main types of housing nearby: apartments, genuine houses, and dormitory buildings. First, in apartments, there are usually 2-4 individuals sharing a room, with 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type accommodates about two floors, averaging around 20 residents per building. Second, there are actual houses available for individuals affiliated with the school to rent, typically with 2-4 bedrooms, often inhabited by alumni. However, these houses are less common around the neighborhood due to lower efficiency. Lastly, the typical dorm rooms, accommodating hundreds of students, are the most prevalent housing type. Here, rooms are usually shared by two people, with some exceptions. With housing explained, let's move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, which is mirrored in the composition of my neighborhood. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most professional staff live in the neighborhood’s houses, while newer students occupy dormitory-style housing and older students prefer apartment-style living. The richness of people in this neighborhood cannot be captured adequately with mere words, so let's shift focus to the stores and parks. Since my school essentially functions as its own self-sufficient neighborhood, it offers a wide array of stores and a single park. The stores include a range of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Consequently, everything needed can be found within the bounds of my neighborhood! Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for the diverse members of my community and is maintained clean and safe by everyone's efforts!",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are a rare sight. The landscape is mostly sloped, with my home perched atop the steepest incline in the area. Locals have dubbed it the \"exercise hill\" due to the number of joggers who opt to tackle it as part of their fitness routines. Since sidewalks are nonexistent on my street, pedestrians share the roadway. The road itself has a few rough patches, making driving feel a bit precarious. Telephone and electric lines crisscross the neighborhood, appearing somewhat ragged. Frequent rain and storms cause branches and debris to hit the power lines, resulting in repeated repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees dominate the scenery. However, many residents are not fond of them; they prefer to cut them down to improve their ocean view. Consequently, numerous homes are built high on the hill with expansive glass-fronted second stories, designed to capture the scenic bay view. The sunsets are particularly stunning, with the water seeming illuminated from beneath and the sky turning a vibrant orange. However, it's often cloudy, and the sunlight typically filters through a haze. Overcast and damp conditions are the norm, leading to moss thriving on surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and it became moss-covered, taking three hours to clean. Children are scarce here, despite a school being nearby. The neighborhood is predominantly inhabited by older residents, many of whom are retired. Instead of kids, dogs are prevalent, often spotted lounging on lawns or chasing one another down the street. Leaving a door or window open invites the risk of a canine intruder. I once found one in my living room and had to guide it outside. Rabbits roam freely, and gardeners detest them for uprooting plants and burrowing in lawns. My cats, however, enjoy chasing them and have driven most away. Birdlife includes sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle until local crows chase them off. There are no stores nearby, but a short trek downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The lack of a sandy beach is offset by the fun of skipping rocks on the shore. The bay is narrow, allowing a clear view of the opposite shore, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you're considering a trip to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be a hassle! The area is well-served by public transport, which is a favored way to get around in New York City. As an urban neighborhood, you'll definitely get the quintessential New York City vibe. Expect to encounter numerous Asian businesses during your visit. Over the last 20 years, there's been a significant increase in the Asian population in Bensonhurst. As you stroll around, you'll likely come across an Asian-owned shop on nearly every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are especially prevalent. These establishments are quite popular with the locals, thanks to the excellent quality of food at the supermarkets, the affordability, and the convenience. In fact, where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, enhancing the ease of grocery shopping. However, it's worth noting that Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian. The neighborhood is quite diverse, with a mix of immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children. Many of the well-known businesses in the area are run by Asians, but you'll also find a newly renovated park nearby. This park features about ten basketball courts, a large field suitable for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and even a water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. Being in New York City, the parks are naturally very diverse, and you'll find people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. The neighborhood lacks large corporate buildings; instead, you'll mostly see co-op buildings or condominium apartments. Most residences are two-family homes. The locals are generally friendly, albeit quite noisy. It's common to hear cars with loud music driving past or engines revving, which can be quite an awakening in the morning. If you visit at night, exercise some caution. While the area is relatively safe, unpredictability is always a factor. Encounters with troublemakers, bullies, or thieves can occur. I, myself, have experienced bullying here long ago through physical assault, and package theft is another issue that occasionally arises. Lastly, despite New York City's regulations on cleaning up after dogs, compliance in this neighborhood is low. Each morning, you might spot at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. This is a particular annoyance of mine—dog waste scattered around is something I find bothersome. So, tread carefully and keep your footwear clean!",
            "When you think of Portland, Oregon, the concept of \"weird\" is crucial to grasp. The city's unofficial motto, emblazoned on the back of a building that moonlights as a pizza spot, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—reads \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the '90s and early 2000s—a less renowned and more affordable place that birthed distinctive subcultures. For others, it's an invitation: come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is a badge of honor. Even with the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos to house them, Portland retains its quirkiness. Weirdness doesn't guarantee universal acceptance, but it does embrace what typically isn't accepted. It doesn't mean we shun modern conveniences or battles; like much of the country, our goods often hail from China. There are countless ways to be atypical, yet Portland is replete with the ordinary—yoga classes, hipsters, and business professionals abound. Perhaps our weirdness lies in not taking all this too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many across Portland, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes come summer. These boxes, mostly made of cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items people no longer need, often containing unexpected treasures for passersby. They usually contain clothes and books, but could hold anything. The enchanting possibility of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of Portland. At least, that's my take, though I'm just one kind of weird among many. Some residents wouldn't dream of scavenging clothes from a street-side box. They might instead attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with live goats) or cheer at Timbers soccer games. Portland brims with individuals chasing diverse passions—or dreaming of doing so while lingering too long at bars. Yes, Portland faces a drug issue, often linked to mental health struggles exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Homelessness is another challenge, one without clear solutions. The homeless are drawn by Portland's superior social services compared to other regions, though these services still fall short, as they do nationwide. The housed population swings between compassion and hostility. In this aspect, Portland is quite typical.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence. To the north, they observe the sun's path each morning and evening. Even when I overlook them or get too absorbed in my daily routines, they remain, steadfast and indifferent to life's ups and downs. On particularly stressful days, they demand attention, offering solace and strength to continue, one day at a time. I first arrived here when I began my undergraduate studies, and it was the mountains just north of the campus that initially caught my eye. Certainly, the university boasts its own impressive sights with buildings, ponds, and trees that have captured a piece of my heart, but the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town holds its own charm. Numerous cafés have been the backdrop for countless hours of intense study sessions. A short walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and offices exude an air of history. Here, this seemingly suburban town reveals an energy and liveliness comparable to its neighboring city. This vibrant atmosphere, however, doesn't extend far, allowing an easy return to the tranquil small-town vibe past the library. This combination of different atmospheres in close proximity gives the city an enchanting allure, inviting exploration. This setting makes it easy to create many treasured memories tied to various parts of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park with friends after a long night or racing through bustling downtown to catch a movie at the upscale theater with university-provided tickets. Naturally, it also holds difficult memories, as any place in life does. The ponds, in particular, serve as a fitting spot for reflection or late-night emotional release during existential crises, the latter being my more frequent experience. Observing turtles, ducks, and insects going about their lives, each playing a role, I often ponder my own purpose as I navigate the complexities of life. So, I walked beyond the pond, past the park and suburban houses, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees, coloring the sky, and as I glanced up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. Sure enough, there they were, as they always had been. The majestic mountains rose above the hazy blue and yellow sky more prominently than any nearby building, and in their silent grandeur, they reignited my determination.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this area—it's tucked behind a commercial strip and doesn't seem like a place people would choose to reside. It's a residential area that many wouldn't expect to be inhabited. However, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods and continue behind the hotels, which are mostly vacant except for family gatherings during summer, you'll stumble upon a lively neighborhood. This community is lined with apartment complexes that resemble a series of carefully arranged Russian nesting dolls, each placed with precision along the street. The initial set of apartments has been in the news for some unsavory reasons, so we'll skip over those—appearances can often be misleading. Yet, the neighboring complexes offer a different story, one that remains largely unknown to the locals. Opposite these buildings is a satellite campus of a community college, a peaceful cluster of structures where students, coffee in hand, arrive early in the morning, ready to tackle their day. The gates squeak open to let them in, causing commuters to express their frustration when the increased traffic slows their journey. The road ends at another residential street, bordered by a park and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. This center features inviting porch furniture and a ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Across the street, children play in the park, running across the grass while bees buzz around the flowers. Seniors walk their dogs, casting disapproving looks at the skateboarders and exchanging polite nods with the teenage girls gossiping by the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant offers affordable meals, though it rarely seems crowded. Next door is a swimming supply store and a nail salon nestled in between. Here, you can prepare your pool for summer, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one trip—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop frequented by teens in the park, who enjoy their cold treats while performing skateboard tricks and vaping, thinking it's the height of coolness. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana, a relic of the unchanging south where time seems to stand still.",
            "The neighborhood I live in is quite intriguing. While most houses are designed for single families, a few have been cleverly divided into two separate units, yet remain attached, which might sound a bit unusual. My house features a modest yard at the front and a small driveway on its left side. Like many others here, it evokes a sense of nostalgia from a time not too distant when suburban life epitomized the American dream. This dream, once warmly embraced by the nation, now feels somewhat distant. Nevertheless, neighborhoods like mine persist, inviting us and visitors alike to believe that this dream is still alive and we strive to hold onto it. The residents may not exude the same optimism as before, and the maintenance of the quaint yards has declined. Yet, there are still cars parked in every driveway, and children playing with the belief that their world is all-encompassing. The local public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking fond memories among the older community members. Although churches are sparse and often empty, the basketball courts remain bustling with activity. Each home has its unique appearance, yet they all share a familiar feel. A significant establishment is Super \"A,\" a large supermarket operated by a Yemeni family, likely the sole Arab family in the area. The community predominantly comprises African American residents. The streets are broad, providing a playground for kids who pause their football games only to let cars pass. Most families have resided here for generations, sharing tales of a past where everyone was acquainted. There used to be a karate school, but as interest waned with fewer karate-themed movies from Hollywood, it transformed into a pharmacy—perhaps a nod to the belief that medicine solves all woes. A small movie theater, offering classic films at reduced prices, draws the older crowd who appreciate its quaint charm, undeterred by its lack of new releases. An expressway skirts our town, though the entry and exit ramps are located in the neighboring town. A proposal once circulated to add an exit for our town; the younger generation supported it, but the elders opposed, fearing it would alter our town's essence, ultimately swaying the city council to reject the idea. A new high school is under construction, and we're in the midst of choosing a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin, perfectly encapsulating the character of our town.",
            "Living in a bustling metropolis, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential zones intermingle with commercial spaces, which host a myriad of businesses. These range from office complexes to an assortment of shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. The selection of new restaurants to dine at and shops to explore is vast. While some retail outlets are large, recognizable brand names owned by major corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity. They are not just found in shopping centers; they also line the streets, within walking distance of typically tranquil neighborhoods, which become lively due to the many attractions nearby. Additionally, there are a couple of parks in the vicinity, which I often see families with young children enjoying. Regarding the community, there's a remarkable level of diversity here. In a compact area, we have a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Expanding a bit beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city hosts individuals from a wide range of racial and ethnic backgrounds, though they often cluster into distinct communities. We have areas like Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia, and others, just a few miles away. However, a short distance can turn into an extensive drive. Traveling a mere 10 miles might take up to two hours during peak traffic times. Walking isn't common here, even though some attractions are nearby. The city's vastness and sprawling layout generally deter people from walking. Consequently, we suffer from some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is a challenge. Ironically, there's been a surge in construction recently, with new apartment complexes sprouting up. The city attracts many newcomers, but this growth worries current residents, who dread increased congestion on the roads. Housing options in my city are diverse as well. Not everyone opts for high-rise apartment living. Residential areas feature various house types, smaller apartment buildings, and condos. Some properties are single-family homes, while others are duplexes. This diversity in housing is evident even within my neighborhood. The area is also home to people of different ages, and honestly, I don't know most of my neighbors. The community isn't as close-knit as it once was, although I fondly recall my childhood days playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the area, who were all around my age.",
            "As we cruised by the endless rows of corn stretching into the horizon, she turned to me and asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" fully aware that the vast, open landscape would be a surprise to her. She hailed from a place where a quick five-minute walk got you to the grocery store—she had never encountered such expansive emptiness before. Captivated by the omnipresent cornfields, I began to explain what it was like growing up in the rural parts of Ohio. It was then that she began to understand my roots and the place I called home. Our journey continued down a narrow country road, eventually leading to a water-filled quarry. Just beyond, lay the modest neighborhood where I reside, characterized by brick and stucco homes. Each house boasts at least half an acre of land, which the residents diligently maintain. Springtime brings an explosion of flowers along with the ever-changing Midwest trees. The driveways host gleaming Mercedes Benz luxury cars, sparkling in the sunshine after a thorough wash. Moving towards my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is often out front, greeting everyone with a smile. He spends his days mowing the lawn, his voice rising above the mower’s hum with cheerful singing. Though his age has softened his sharpness, his genuine nature and fascinating history as a former doctor endear him to everyone. Finally, we arrive at my home. Our side yard is a haven for geese, often pursued by our spirited Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, its sounds mingling with the croaks of bullfrogs and distant cow moos from neighboring farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched sanctuary of wild trees, herbs, and flowers, where I spent much of my childhood. Building tree forts and playfully chasing animals were daily adventures, always shared with a neighborhood friend. Winters here are harsh yet breathtakingly beautiful. The landscape transforms from lush greenery to a stark wilderness, with trees shedding their colorful blooms for bare branches. When snow graces the ground, a magical scene unfolds overnight. Our backyard becomes a canvas for snow angels and snowmen, crafted by my younger sister. Our sibling rivalry often played out through snowball fights, fortified by igloo-like structures built from branches. In this enchanting winter landscape, we played make-believe, oblivious to the world beyond, simply enjoying being carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in a rural part of America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, the landscape shifts from expansive farmland to quaint tourist towns. We lack major city attractions like big malls, Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee's. Getting anywhere requires a drive. Nonetheless, I am fortunate to live in one of the most picturesque places globally, encircled by water. My town is bordered by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are abundant, perfect for a leisurely visit. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses are not crammed together. They are unique, some being older structures that have been updated or remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Most homes feature full basements that are visible from the street. Many of the houses here sport older aluminum siding. The blocks surrounding my house boast homes in a variety of colors. These homes typically have yards, complete with trampolines and playsets. Some residents maintain gardens and fences for their pets. The neighborhood reflects Middle America—hardworking individuals striving to make a living, many raising or having raised families. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, while others walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors recognize each other, easily distinguishing between familiar faces and newcomers. It's common to see someone grilling in their yard, offering a wave, or a friendly smile from someone walking their dog a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with no accumulation of leaves from fall. The grass is kept green and neatly trimmed. If there are plants or bushes, they are well-pruned. While the neighborhood might not impress with grandiose homes, it exudes a welcoming atmosphere ideal for family life. It is serene, quiet, and safe. Although average in appearance, it offers something invaluable: a secure haven to return to at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there is the county sheriff’s office and jail. The health department is conveniently located next door. The city’s recycling center is just down the road, frequented by locals for its services. Nearby, baseball and softball fields come alive with the sounds of announcers calling scores and player names. Adjacent to these fields is our small town airport. The rumble of small planes taking off and landing is a common backdrop, whether you're indoors or out. A local ice cream shop is within strolling distance, and a short walk can take you downtown. My kids can easily ride their bikes to the park, which is about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The area where I reside can be best described as a classic suburban setting. In my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice the uniformity of well-kept single-family homes, which is largely due to the homeowner's association's efforts. The front yards are strikingly similar, featuring a small patch of landscaped grass, decorative stones, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot some small trees as well. Each house is equipped with a two-car garage. As you navigate through the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads that are exceptionally well-maintained, devoid of any potholes, despite the presence of numerous families. Most houses are single-story, but two-story homes appear occasionally. \n\nInterestingly, our mailbox setup differs from the typical single-family home arrangement. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, reminiscent of an apartment complex. Residents use a key to access their specific mailbox, and there are two larger lockers for packages. This setup is another testament to the HOA's preference for uniformity. Situated on the outskirts of a nearby city, my neighborhood blends suburban and rural characteristics, offering ample land for various activities. We have several community pools available to residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are numerous walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. The neighborhood's size allows for ample exercise without needing to visit a park. \n\nThe majority of our community consists of retirees, making it a safe area where neighbors look out for each other, although we do have a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. The nearby city, while large by population, retains a small-town feel and offers most amenities one might need. For instance, there's a single mall that, although not large, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, where I find a variety of stores. We have everything from high-end grocery stores offering organic products to budget outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep prices low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and fairly typical. We enjoy amenities like pools and walking trails, and while not immediately adjacent to shopping areas, a short drive provides access to major retailers.",
            "I first learned about my neighborhood while tuning in to a podcast about missing persons. It caught me off guard. Apartments nearby have rents exceeding a thousand dollars monthly. Neither my friends nor I had ever come across that tale before. Perhaps it's the challenge that binds us. Some friends of mine find themselves in tears come nightfall. Life's pricey here, yet we've mastered the art of thriftiness. Over time, the scent of flea market trinkets and clothes with a hint of mothball becomes endearing. As adults, we seem to notice odors less. Whether you pick up smoking or just grow used to it, the flea market scent remains. The aroma of adulthood could be described as dusty periodicals atop a closed piano, lingering in leather even after a wash. Around here, three thrift shops are just a stroll away. Begin at one end, and you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio outlet. Downtown is bustling, teeming with cars and people every morning, yet inside these thrifts, tranquility reigns. Regardless of the traffic or footfall, silence envelops the store. It's an inviting spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, the area sees an influx of cars and people. It's labeled as a burgeoning city, housing one of the leading e-commerce and delivery giants, yet still showing signs of growing pains. It brings to mind New York, where everyone is driven by their own ambitions, and little is demanded of you. Solitude and independence are respected here; people won't intrude. Unlike the South, where concern equals care, here, privacy is upheld. You can maintain your personal space indefinitely, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It's a vibrant environment. Between the pianist next door and the aspiring singers upstairs, there's always activity. Our apartment feels less like a collection of strangers and more like a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate milestones, grieve losses, and lend a hand whenever possible. I'm fortunate to be part of this. I genuinely appreciate most of my neighbors, and they seem to think kindly of me. I make an effort to tidy up after myself, share food, and reciprocate their gestures. We exchange mail too. It's heartening to see them, and I believe they value my company as much as I do theirs. Despite residing in a vast, impersonal modern complex, it's neighbors like these who reassure me that my life choices weren't all that misguided.",
            "Nestled just beyond the suburban sprawl of a bustling city, I reside in a modest Midwestern town. My neighborhood, situated on the town's eastern edge, is often considered its most economically challenged section. Housing prices are quite low, with many residences occupied by low-income tenants or owners. Yet, the area maintains a certain charm and is far from unpleasant. The local community is composed of warm-hearted individuals who frequently exchange greetings as I stroll along the streets. Although crime is marginally more prevalent here compared to other town areas, it remains relatively infrequent. In the past decade, a handful of severe incidents, including shootings and at least one homicide, have occurred nearby. Tragically, a neighboring family lost their son to a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has been fortunate to remain mostly untouched by crime, aside from the occasional item vanishing from our porch when left unattended. More broadly, our town has been significantly impacted by the opioid crisis affecting many regions across the U.S. Numerous lives have been claimed by fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, our community is equipped with various resources to tackle this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for the relatives and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these hurdles, there is much to appreciate about our town. My child's elementary school is staffed with exceptional individuals, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Thanks to the school's supportive environment, my child, who has special needs, has not encountered bullying and truly enjoys attending. An active PTO organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family participation and academic growth. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the school offers free meals to all students, ensuring no child experiences hunger. Families facing financial constraints are treated with dignity, and school-related costs are kept affordable. The City Council has initiated numerous efforts to enhance the town’s appearance, such as road resurfacing, landscaping, and park refurbishments. Regrettably, these improvements are primarily focused on the town center and western side where most shops and traffic are located, often overlooking the eastern part where I live—a source of frustration for many in my neighborhood. All things considered, I genuinely enjoy residing in this town. The people are welcoming, the education system is excellent, and there are sufficient shopping facilities, both small and large, to cater to my family's needs. Our home, while not highly valued, is cozy and serves us well. After 16 years here, my family and I could not picture living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood brims with a vibrant cultural atmosphere. It's perched on a hill and is surrounded by buildings steeped in historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building, directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down the hill is a fascinating little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see people lined up, eager to get inside. A few blocks up, there's the nearest city park, surprisingly large for this part of town. Encasing the park is concrete, with tall steps integrated into the wall. During the chilly winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. Although it rarely snows, the heavy rainfall during mid-winter makes staying warm a challenge. By pitching their tents close together in the city's center, rather than on the outskirts, they stay warmer. Plus, they're within walking distance of the only family center for miles, where they can shower. What truly captivates me about my city isn't just the beauty of its historic architecture or the majestic buildings scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. It's the cultural essence of the people in my neighborhood. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you hear tales of federal agents and the DEA sweeping through, attempting to cleanse the streets. These stories persist, passed from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me. Despite being considered one of the city's tougher areas, residents work diligently to maintain its cleanliness and care about their community. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't wander around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning echoes the past, influenced by social conditioning. Perhaps I seem just dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the persistent reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-driven assumptions, even in a city touted as a melting pot utopia. One thing I know for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. Walking those streets at night invigorates me, as I encounter people who are more inclined to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have kept their doors open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when I had no refuge from the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the most dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this area right before starting eighth grade, and initially, it was challenging to make friends. Eventually, I became close with a neighbor two houses away and another who lived on my street. Though they have since moved away, the memories remain. Most of the original residents from when I first arrived are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I often hear children playing outside. It's generally quiet during the week, and I've never experienced any issues with my neighbors. People tend to keep to themselves unless assistance is needed. I frequently order packages online and have never had one stolen from my porch, which speaks to the trust I have in my neighbors. There's a park just a short walk from my house, where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with local friends. One of my worst memories involves getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive experiences far outweigh the negative. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who enjoy the swings and slides. The thought of the park fills them with excitement, and it now holds a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, with a variety of cuisines available nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food places are popular here, as in most suburbs, and there are numerous pizza spots. Local stores offer everything one might need, including several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a Midwest favorite. Some stores reflect the area's diversity; there's an Indian-owned shop for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about others' negative experiences with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I find living in my neighborhood quite enjoyable, mainly because it's conveniently close to my college. The area is predominantly filled with apartment buildings, but there are also a few restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and reasonably priced. Recently, one of the bars changed its name and became more expensive, but the quality of service and drinks remains decent. The community is generally friendly, comprising mainly college students and individuals from lower income backgrounds, as the apartment rents are quite affordable. An elementary school is within walking distance, so there are many children in the vicinity. I haven’t made an effort to get to know my neighbors, nor do I wish to, since they frequently smoke marijuana. In response, the building management amusingly installed an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I found quite humorous, though it borders on being offensive. \n\nThe buildings surrounding mine tend to look older, although many have updated interiors. Not far from here are some newly constructed apartments, but I'm not fond of them because their construction quality seems poor despite their high rent, which feels like a rip-off. Their proximity to campus allows the management to charge such high prices. There’s an incredibly affordable restaurant about five minutes away that serves food on paper plates, with most dishes being microwaved. Across the road is a gas station, rumored to be an unfavorable workplace. Fortunately, the city funded a road renovation last summer, resulting in a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, which has improved the area’s appearance. \n\nMy apartment building is surrounded by trees, although some have been cut down, leaving a few stumps. However, there are still more trees here than further down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line followed by another apartment set. I reside on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street just behind, which isn’t as well-maintained. Its sidewalks are deteriorating, and most of the buildings appear run-down. The abundance of trees might be an attempt to mask the buildings' condition. Crime is more prevalent in an apartment complex on that street, but it's not limited to there; across the street from me, the apartments also experience crime and have a transient community. Despite everything, I appreciate living here. It’s affordable, and I have access to numerous amenities. The university's proximity is a particular advantage, along with the two bus stops that make trips to the store and downtown convenient.",
            "In my neighborhood, you'll find duplexes arranged around a cul-de-sac. They're spaced in a way that gives the impression of standalone homes, with each one painted yellow and featuring white porches and green metal roofs. Most of us are friendly with each other, gathering at the end of a random driveway some evenings to chat while the neighborhood kids play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing scene in today's technology-driven world, reminiscent of a simpler time. We are surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies with billowing white clouds. However, this season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time last night, we heard the tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. My larger dog, on the other hand, was too anxious to join us in the bathroom and stayed in the living room, barking nervously at the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm passed, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop—from 92 to 75 degrees in mere minutes. The hail melted instantly upon hitting the warm pavement. As I looked up, the clearing skies revealed the sun and a double rainbow appeared. I dashed inside to grab my camera and quickly captured photos to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then, life resumed as usual with mothers and children outside while dinner was cooking. It's a welcoming neighborhood for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone here. Although the houses look identical from the outside, the apartments vary in size, with some being surprisingly small. This puzzles me. I enjoy walking along the large field behind my place and strolling down to the pond, which isn't suitable for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear a giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning begins with the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's like living in a small, self-contained community village. There's even a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening to remind us of his presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "Having spent around a decade here, I feel I can share some insights. When I initially moved to this neighborhood, I felt quite down. Transitioning from Riverdale to Stockbridge was tough; I shed tears over leaving behind what I cherished. My parents, however, had our best interests at heart, seeking improved living conditions and educational opportunities for me and my younger sister. Our new area was perceived as more upscale, offering a better high school and community. Over time, I adjusted, made some new friends, and even a few adversaries at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors well except for Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They became like extended family, and I value their presence in my life. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding (a remarriage), which was a delightful event. I aspire to create such joyful memories in the future, hoping to build a prosperous life for my future spouse. During the wedding, Ms. Veda tossed the garter, and I caught it! Unfortunately, I missed out on catching the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with their daughter, Marsharii, though I haven’t seen her since. I hope she’s pursuing great opportunities. The neighborhood is quite intricate, but with GPS, I’ve ventured further. My explorations were mostly with friends Kason and Curtis; we would immerse ourselves in video games and savor life. Occasionally, I take solace in the park, where nature’s tranquility calms me. I practice balancing with sticks from Home Depot and wield a bokken wooden sword when possible. These activities bring me joy. There are also basketball and tennis courts, though I've been away from these sports for some time. However, they remain available should I decide to revisit them. My dad introduced me to tennis alongside my best friend and Mr. Graves, and those sessions, though challenging, were always enjoyable. Reflecting on my time here, countless enjoyable moments come to mind, and I feel optimistic that the future holds even more exciting experiences!",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming little town that might not immediately catch the eye, yet plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly carries the title of the Peach Capital of the World, as proclaimed by a sign at the town's entrance. The landscape is predominantly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle fields. Homes outside the town center are spread out, mostly two-story structures with either metal roofs to withstand the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, leaving room for front fields dedicated to livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, a single traffic light marks a crossroads where all the local stores are situated. Dining options include Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria was once part of this mix but has since closed. A tiny family-run pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There's also the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, a small but pricey grocery store. Despite being the only grocery store in town, many residents prefer shopping at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery needs. The busiest shop in town is Dollar General, offering a wide range of everyday necessities and bustling with activity from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More, a petite furniture store run by a beloved community member, has been a fixture in Johnston for years, complete with delivery services by two movers. Next to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming business providing services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both a medical and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; though small, they are well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The town has one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students move to a neighboring town for middle and high school. Officially, there are no parks, but plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to offer more family activities and attract visitors and potential residents. While entertainment options are limited—there are no cinemas, bowling alleys, hangout spots, children's playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide variety of restaurants—the town's charm lies in its simplicity, small enough to pass by without even noticing.",
            "Nestled in a typical suburban setting, my residence lies in a quaint southern town in Tennessee. Our street serves as a link between two state highways, which results in more traffic than I'd prefer, yet the neighborhood remains serene. The residents here tend to stay put, and I've grown accustomed to the familiar faces in our community. Many engage in routine tasks like yard maintenance. In the colder months, we enjoy sledding down a hill nearby. Situated on the front corner of our street, our home affords us a view of the daily comings and goings, making us familiar with the usual vehicles. Any new car catches our attention. Neighbors often stroll around either for fitness or while walking their dogs. Children bike around, embodying the typical suburban scene. Since our work is home-based, we spend a lot of time at the house. Our family consists of myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, and our presence is well-known in the area. We enjoy outdoor activities, even playing in the rain occasionally. Barbecuing on our back deck adds a delightful aroma to our surroundings. Throughout the warmer months, lawn mowers are a constant background noise, as grass grows prolifically until October. Originally a wooded region, our neighborhood is rich in trees, providing ample shade as well as an abundance of leaves to manage each Fall. The scent of burning leaves is a pleasant herald of the season. Recently, our Winters have been mild, blending into an extended Fall. With our garage at the rear, we rarely use the front door, unless there's a rare visitor. I often find myself working on my truck or other projects in the garage, which, when open, connects me more to the neighborhood's pulse. Holidays are subdued here. Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother’s Day and Christmas bring visiting families and extra vehicles lining the streets. Overall, life here is enjoyable. If the street wasn't a throughway, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is nestled in the heart of the high desert, characterized by an abundance of dirt and more dirt. For those who haven't lived here, it's hard to truly grasp the constant presence of brown scenery. Spotting a lawn is rare and signals that the homeowner is likely investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s, when I first moved here, houses were sparsely scattered. While that's still somewhat true, there's been a noticeable increase in development. The area increasingly resembles a bustling city, which seems to be a common trend everywhere these days. Generally, the locals are quite welcoming, although, like any urban area, it has its ups and downs. My neighbors are mostly friendly seniors, suggesting it's a pleasant community. Retail options here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, one must travel further, as stores like Whole Foods are absent. The job market, as I perceive it, is dominated by construction, likely due to the city's ongoing development and ample open spaces. This rapid growth is somewhat daunting for me; I prefer the current state of things, having left a major city behind and not wanting to return to that lifestyle. My full-time role is in the construction sector, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the aspects I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. People are drawn to the high desert for many reasons, including its stark beauty. The unique climate and landscape create fragile ecosystems that need protection and are home to various wildlife species. Residents should familiarize themselves with these creatures to coexist peacefully. My family has adapted well to the wildlife; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects, and as I write, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is an excellent destination for families to discover the desert's allure. It offers a distinct experience, especially during the San Bernardino County Fair, which provides a blend of activities and entertainment characteristic of Victorville. Nearby, Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons to round out your visit. Those interested in the high desert's natural history and culture should visit the Victor Valley Museum, which houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the story of Victorville's societal and industrial development.",
            "When it comes to describing my neighborhood, I suspect my perspective might stand out a bit. Unlike others who might be homeowners living their individual lives, my scenario deviates slightly. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, and my community is comprised of the fellow residents in my dormitory. I also include the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional concepts of a neighborhood. Like any typical neighborhood, mine features houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by examining the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, it's important to clarify the types of housing present in my area. There are three main types of housing nearby: apartments, genuine houses, and dormitory buildings. First, in apartments, there are usually 2-4 individuals sharing a room, with 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type accommodates about two floors, averaging around 20 residents per building. Second, there are actual houses available for individuals affiliated with the school to rent, typically with 2-4 bedrooms, often inhabited by alumni. However, these houses are less common around the neighborhood due to lower efficiency. Lastly, the typical dorm rooms, accommodating hundreds of students, are the most prevalent housing type. Here, rooms are usually shared by two people, with some exceptions. With housing explained, let's move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, which is mirrored in the composition of my neighborhood. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most professional staff live in the neighborhood’s houses, while newer students occupy dormitory-style housing and older students prefer apartment-style living. The richness of people in this neighborhood cannot be captured adequately with mere words, so let's shift focus to the stores and parks. Since my school essentially functions as its own self-sufficient neighborhood, it offers a wide array of stores and a single park. The stores include a range of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Consequently, everything needed can be found within the bounds of my neighborhood! Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for the diverse members of my community and is maintained clean and safe by everyone's efforts!",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are a rare sight. The landscape is mostly sloped, with my home perched atop the steepest incline in the area. Locals have dubbed it the \"exercise hill\" due to the number of joggers who opt to tackle it as part of their fitness routines. Since sidewalks are nonexistent on my street, pedestrians share the roadway. The road itself has a few rough patches, making driving feel a bit precarious. Telephone and electric lines crisscross the neighborhood, appearing somewhat ragged. Frequent rain and storms cause branches and debris to hit the power lines, resulting in repeated repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees dominate the scenery. However, many residents are not fond of them; they prefer to cut them down to improve their ocean view. Consequently, numerous homes are built high on the hill with expansive glass-fronted second stories, designed to capture the scenic bay view. The sunsets are particularly stunning, with the water seeming illuminated from beneath and the sky turning a vibrant orange. However, it's often cloudy, and the sunlight typically filters through a haze. Overcast and damp conditions are the norm, leading to moss thriving on surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and it became moss-covered, taking three hours to clean. Children are scarce here, despite a school being nearby. The neighborhood is predominantly inhabited by older residents, many of whom are retired. Instead of kids, dogs are prevalent, often spotted lounging on lawns or chasing one another down the street. Leaving a door or window open invites the risk of a canine intruder. I once found one in my living room and had to guide it outside. Rabbits roam freely, and gardeners detest them for uprooting plants and burrowing in lawns. My cats, however, enjoy chasing them and have driven most away. Birdlife includes sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle until local crows chase them off. There are no stores nearby, but a short trek downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The lack of a sandy beach is offset by the fun of skipping rocks on the shore. The bay is narrow, allowing a clear view of the opposite shore, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you're considering a trip to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be a hassle! The area is well-served by public transport, which is a favored way to get around in New York City. As an urban neighborhood, you'll definitely get the quintessential New York City vibe. Expect to encounter numerous Asian businesses during your visit. Over the last 20 years, there's been a significant increase in the Asian population in Bensonhurst. As you stroll around, you'll likely come across an Asian-owned shop on nearly every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are especially prevalent. These establishments are quite popular with the locals, thanks to the excellent quality of food at the supermarkets, the affordability, and the convenience. In fact, where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, enhancing the ease of grocery shopping. However, it's worth noting that Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian. The neighborhood is quite diverse, with a mix of immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children. Many of the well-known businesses in the area are run by Asians, but you'll also find a newly renovated park nearby. This park features about ten basketball courts, a large field suitable for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and even a water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. Being in New York City, the parks are naturally very diverse, and you'll find people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. The neighborhood lacks large corporate buildings; instead, you'll mostly see co-op buildings or condominium apartments. Most residences are two-family homes. The locals are generally friendly, albeit quite noisy. It's common to hear cars with loud music driving past or engines revving, which can be quite an awakening in the morning. If you visit at night, exercise some caution. While the area is relatively safe, unpredictability is always a factor. Encounters with troublemakers, bullies, or thieves can occur. I, myself, have experienced bullying here long ago through physical assault, and package theft is another issue that occasionally arises. Lastly, despite New York City's regulations on cleaning up after dogs, compliance in this neighborhood is low. Each morning, you might spot at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. This is a particular annoyance of mine—dog waste scattered around is something I find bothersome. So, tread carefully and keep your footwear clean!",
            "When you think of Portland, Oregon, the concept of \"weird\" is crucial to grasp. The city's unofficial motto, emblazoned on the back of a building that moonlights as a pizza spot, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—reads \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the '90s and early 2000s—a less renowned and more affordable place that birthed distinctive subcultures. For others, it's an invitation: come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is a badge of honor. Even with the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos to house them, Portland retains its quirkiness. Weirdness doesn't guarantee universal acceptance, but it does embrace what typically isn't accepted. It doesn't mean we shun modern conveniences or battles; like much of the country, our goods often hail from China. There are countless ways to be atypical, yet Portland is replete with the ordinary—yoga classes, hipsters, and business professionals abound. Perhaps our weirdness lies in not taking all this too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many across Portland, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes come summer. These boxes, mostly made of cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items people no longer need, often containing unexpected treasures for passersby. They usually contain clothes and books, but could hold anything. The enchanting possibility of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of Portland. At least, that's my take, though I'm just one kind of weird among many. Some residents wouldn't dream of scavenging clothes from a street-side box. They might instead attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with live goats) or cheer at Timbers soccer games. Portland brims with individuals chasing diverse passions—or dreaming of doing so while lingering too long at bars. Yes, Portland faces a drug issue, often linked to mental health struggles exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Homelessness is another challenge, one without clear solutions. The homeless are drawn by Portland's superior social services compared to other regions, though these services still fall short, as they do nationwide. The housed population swings between compassion and hostility. In this aspect, Portland is quite typical.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence. To the north, they observe the sun's path each morning and evening. Even when I overlook them or get too absorbed in my daily routines, they remain, steadfast and indifferent to life's ups and downs. On particularly stressful days, they demand attention, offering solace and strength to continue, one day at a time. I first arrived here when I began my undergraduate studies, and it was the mountains just north of the campus that initially caught my eye. Certainly, the university boasts its own impressive sights with buildings, ponds, and trees that have captured a piece of my heart, but the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town holds its own charm. Numerous cafés have been the backdrop for countless hours of intense study sessions. A short walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and offices exude an air of history. Here, this seemingly suburban town reveals an energy and liveliness comparable to its neighboring city. This vibrant atmosphere, however, doesn't extend far, allowing an easy return to the tranquil small-town vibe past the library. This combination of different atmospheres in close proximity gives the city an enchanting allure, inviting exploration. This setting makes it easy to create many treasured memories tied to various parts of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park with friends after a long night or racing through bustling downtown to catch a movie at the upscale theater with university-provided tickets. Naturally, it also holds difficult memories, as any place in life does. The ponds, in particular, serve as a fitting spot for reflection or late-night emotional release during existential crises, the latter being my more frequent experience. Observing turtles, ducks, and insects going about their lives, each playing a role, I often ponder my own purpose as I navigate the complexities of life. So, I walked beyond the pond, past the park and suburban houses, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees, coloring the sky, and as I glanced up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. Sure enough, there they were, as they always had been. The majestic mountains rose above the hazy blue and yellow sky more prominently than any nearby building, and in their silent grandeur, they reignited my determination.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this area—it's tucked behind a commercial strip and doesn't seem like a place people would choose to reside. It's a residential area that many wouldn't expect to be inhabited. However, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods and continue behind the hotels, which are mostly vacant except for family gatherings during summer, you'll stumble upon a lively neighborhood. This community is lined with apartment complexes that resemble a series of carefully arranged Russian nesting dolls, each placed with precision along the street. The initial set of apartments has been in the news for some unsavory reasons, so we'll skip over those—appearances can often be misleading. Yet, the neighboring complexes offer a different story, one that remains largely unknown to the locals. Opposite these buildings is a satellite campus of a community college, a peaceful cluster of structures where students, coffee in hand, arrive early in the morning, ready to tackle their day. The gates squeak open to let them in, causing commuters to express their frustration when the increased traffic slows their journey. The road ends at another residential street, bordered by a park and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. This center features inviting porch furniture and a ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Across the street, children play in the park, running across the grass while bees buzz around the flowers. Seniors walk their dogs, casting disapproving looks at the skateboarders and exchanging polite nods with the teenage girls gossiping by the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant offers affordable meals, though it rarely seems crowded. Next door is a swimming supply store and a nail salon nestled in between. Here, you can prepare your pool for summer, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one trip—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop frequented by teens in the park, who enjoy their cold treats while performing skateboard tricks and vaping, thinking it's the height of coolness. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana, a relic of the unchanging south where time seems to stand still.",
            "The neighborhood I live in is quite intriguing. While most houses are designed for single families, a few have been cleverly divided into two separate units, yet remain attached, which might sound a bit unusual. My house features a modest yard at the front and a small driveway on its left side. Like many others here, it evokes a sense of nostalgia from a time not too distant when suburban life epitomized the American dream. This dream, once warmly embraced by the nation, now feels somewhat distant. Nevertheless, neighborhoods like mine persist, inviting us and visitors alike to believe that this dream is still alive and we strive to hold onto it. The residents may not exude the same optimism as before, and the maintenance of the quaint yards has declined. Yet, there are still cars parked in every driveway, and children playing with the belief that their world is all-encompassing. The local public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking fond memories among the older community members. Although churches are sparse and often empty, the basketball courts remain bustling with activity. Each home has its unique appearance, yet they all share a familiar feel. A significant establishment is Super \"A,\" a large supermarket operated by a Yemeni family, likely the sole Arab family in the area. The community predominantly comprises African American residents. The streets are broad, providing a playground for kids who pause their football games only to let cars pass. Most families have resided here for generations, sharing tales of a past where everyone was acquainted. There used to be a karate school, but as interest waned with fewer karate-themed movies from Hollywood, it transformed into a pharmacy—perhaps a nod to the belief that medicine solves all woes. A small movie theater, offering classic films at reduced prices, draws the older crowd who appreciate its quaint charm, undeterred by its lack of new releases. An expressway skirts our town, though the entry and exit ramps are located in the neighboring town. A proposal once circulated to add an exit for our town; the younger generation supported it, but the elders opposed, fearing it would alter our town's essence, ultimately swaying the city council to reject the idea. A new high school is under construction, and we're in the midst of choosing a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin, perfectly encapsulating the character of our town.",
            "Living in a bustling metropolis, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential zones intermingle with commercial spaces, which host a myriad of businesses. These range from office complexes to an assortment of shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. The selection of new restaurants to dine at and shops to explore is vast. While some retail outlets are large, recognizable brand names owned by major corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity. They are not just found in shopping centers; they also line the streets, within walking distance of typically tranquil neighborhoods, which become lively due to the many attractions nearby. Additionally, there are a couple of parks in the vicinity, which I often see families with young children enjoying. Regarding the community, there's a remarkable level of diversity here. In a compact area, we have a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Expanding a bit beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city hosts individuals from a wide range of racial and ethnic backgrounds, though they often cluster into distinct communities. We have areas like Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia, and others, just a few miles away. However, a short distance can turn into an extensive drive. Traveling a mere 10 miles might take up to two hours during peak traffic times. Walking isn't common here, even though some attractions are nearby. The city's vastness and sprawling layout generally deter people from walking. Consequently, we suffer from some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is a challenge. Ironically, there's been a surge in construction recently, with new apartment complexes sprouting up. The city attracts many newcomers, but this growth worries current residents, who dread increased congestion on the roads. Housing options in my city are diverse as well. Not everyone opts for high-rise apartment living. Residential areas feature various house types, smaller apartment buildings, and condos. Some properties are single-family homes, while others are duplexes. This diversity in housing is evident even within my neighborhood. The area is also home to people of different ages, and honestly, I don't know most of my neighbors. The community isn't as close-knit as it once was, although I fondly recall my childhood days playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the area, who were all around my age.",
            "As we cruised by the endless rows of corn stretching into the horizon, she turned to me and asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" fully aware that the vast, open landscape would be a surprise to her. She hailed from a place where a quick five-minute walk got you to the grocery store—she had never encountered such expansive emptiness before. Captivated by the omnipresent cornfields, I began to explain what it was like growing up in the rural parts of Ohio. It was then that she began to understand my roots and the place I called home. Our journey continued down a narrow country road, eventually leading to a water-filled quarry. Just beyond, lay the modest neighborhood where I reside, characterized by brick and stucco homes. Each house boasts at least half an acre of land, which the residents diligently maintain. Springtime brings an explosion of flowers along with the ever-changing Midwest trees. The driveways host gleaming Mercedes Benz luxury cars, sparkling in the sunshine after a thorough wash. Moving towards my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is often out front, greeting everyone with a smile. He spends his days mowing the lawn, his voice rising above the mower’s hum with cheerful singing. Though his age has softened his sharpness, his genuine nature and fascinating history as a former doctor endear him to everyone. Finally, we arrive at my home. Our side yard is a haven for geese, often pursued by our spirited Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, its sounds mingling with the croaks of bullfrogs and distant cow moos from neighboring farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched sanctuary of wild trees, herbs, and flowers, where I spent much of my childhood. Building tree forts and playfully chasing animals were daily adventures, always shared with a neighborhood friend. Winters here are harsh yet breathtakingly beautiful. The landscape transforms from lush greenery to a stark wilderness, with trees shedding their colorful blooms for bare branches. When snow graces the ground, a magical scene unfolds overnight. Our backyard becomes a canvas for snow angels and snowmen, crafted by my younger sister. Our sibling rivalry often played out through snowball fights, fortified by igloo-like structures built from branches. In this enchanting winter landscape, we played make-believe, oblivious to the world beyond, simply enjoying being carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in a rural part of America, specifically in a small town in Michigan. Here, the landscape shifts from expansive farmland to quaint tourist towns. We lack major city attractions like big malls, Walmart, Target, or even an Applebee's. Getting anywhere requires a drive. Nonetheless, I am fortunate to live in one of the most picturesque places globally, encircled by water. My town is bordered by water, with the stunning Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are abundant, perfect for a leisurely visit. My neighborhood embodies the essence of a small town. The houses are not crammed together. They are unique, some being older structures that have been updated or remodeled, while others retain their original charm. Most homes feature full basements that are visible from the street. Many of the houses here sport older aluminum siding. The blocks surrounding my house boast homes in a variety of colors. These homes typically have yards, complete with trampolines and playsets. Some residents maintain gardens and fences for their pets. The neighborhood reflects Middle America—hardworking individuals striving to make a living, many raising or having raised families. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, while others walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors recognize each other, easily distinguishing between familiar faces and newcomers. It's common to see someone grilling in their yard, offering a wave, or a friendly smile from someone walking their dog a few blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with no accumulation of leaves from fall. The grass is kept green and neatly trimmed. If there are plants or bushes, they are well-pruned. While the neighborhood might not impress with grandiose homes, it exudes a welcoming atmosphere ideal for family life. It is serene, quiet, and safe. Although average in appearance, it offers something invaluable: a secure haven to return to at the end of the day. Within walking distance, there is the county sheriff’s office and jail. The health department is conveniently located next door. The city’s recycling center is just down the road, frequented by locals for its services. Nearby, baseball and softball fields come alive with the sounds of announcers calling scores and player names. Adjacent to these fields is our small town airport. The rumble of small planes taking off and landing is a common backdrop, whether you're indoors or out. A local ice cream shop is within strolling distance, and a short walk can take you downtown. My kids can easily ride their bikes to the park, which is about eight blocks away. It's truly a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The area where I reside can be best described as a classic suburban setting. In my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice the uniformity of well-kept single-family homes, which is largely due to the homeowner's association's efforts. The front yards are strikingly similar, featuring a small patch of landscaped grass, decorative stones, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot some small trees as well. Each house is equipped with a two-car garage. As you navigate through the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads that are exceptionally well-maintained, devoid of any potholes, despite the presence of numerous families. Most houses are single-story, but two-story homes appear occasionally. \n\nInterestingly, our mailbox setup differs from the typical single-family home arrangement. Instead of individual mailboxes in front of each house, we have a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, reminiscent of an apartment complex. Residents use a key to access their specific mailbox, and there are two larger lockers for packages. This setup is another testament to the HOA's preference for uniformity. Situated on the outskirts of a nearby city, my neighborhood blends suburban and rural characteristics, offering ample land for various activities. We have several community pools available to residents, which are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are numerous walking trails for dog walking or evening strolls. The neighborhood's size allows for ample exercise without needing to visit a park. \n\nThe majority of our community consists of retirees, making it a safe area where neighbors look out for each other, although we do have a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. The nearby city, while large by population, retains a small-town feel and offers most amenities one might need. For instance, there's a single mall that, although not large, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes of driving to reach significant destinations, where I find a variety of stores. We have everything from high-end grocery stores offering organic products to budget outlets with limited selections and minimal staff to keep prices low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and fairly typical. We enjoy amenities like pools and walking trails, and while not immediately adjacent to shopping areas, a short drive provides access to major retailers.",
            "I first learned about my neighborhood while tuning in to a podcast about missing persons. It caught me off guard. Apartments nearby have rents exceeding a thousand dollars monthly. Neither my friends nor I had ever come across that tale before. Perhaps it's the challenge that binds us. Some friends of mine find themselves in tears come nightfall. Life's pricey here, yet we've mastered the art of thriftiness. Over time, the scent of flea market trinkets and clothes with a hint of mothball becomes endearing. As adults, we seem to notice odors less. Whether you pick up smoking or just grow used to it, the flea market scent remains. The aroma of adulthood could be described as dusty periodicals atop a closed piano, lingering in leather even after a wash. Around here, three thrift shops are just a stroll away. Begin at one end, and you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio outlet. Downtown is bustling, teeming with cars and people every morning, yet inside these thrifts, tranquility reigns. Regardless of the traffic or footfall, silence envelops the store. It's an inviting spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, the area sees an influx of cars and people. It's labeled as a burgeoning city, housing one of the leading e-commerce and delivery giants, yet still showing signs of growing pains. It brings to mind New York, where everyone is driven by their own ambitions, and little is demanded of you. Solitude and independence are respected here; people won't intrude. Unlike the South, where concern equals care, here, privacy is upheld. You can maintain your personal space indefinitely, while the city ebbs and flows like ocean waves. It's a vibrant environment. Between the pianist next door and the aspiring singers upstairs, there's always activity. Our apartment feels less like a collection of strangers and more like a community of friends. We support each other, celebrate milestones, grieve losses, and lend a hand whenever possible. I'm fortunate to be part of this. I genuinely appreciate most of my neighbors, and they seem to think kindly of me. I make an effort to tidy up after myself, share food, and reciprocate their gestures. We exchange mail too. It's heartening to see them, and I believe they value my company as much as I do theirs. Despite residing in a vast, impersonal modern complex, it's neighbors like these who reassure me that my life choices weren't all that misguided.",
            "Nestled just beyond the suburban sprawl of a bustling city, I reside in a modest Midwestern town. My neighborhood, situated on the town's eastern edge, is often considered its most economically challenged section. Housing prices are quite low, with many residences occupied by low-income tenants or owners. Yet, the area maintains a certain charm and is far from unpleasant. The local community is composed of warm-hearted individuals who frequently exchange greetings as I stroll along the streets. Although crime is marginally more prevalent here compared to other town areas, it remains relatively infrequent. In the past decade, a handful of severe incidents, including shootings and at least one homicide, have occurred nearby. Tragically, a neighboring family lost their son to a shooting outside a bar last year. Our family has been fortunate to remain mostly untouched by crime, aside from the occasional item vanishing from our porch when left unattended. More broadly, our town has been significantly impacted by the opioid crisis affecting many regions across the U.S. Numerous lives have been claimed by fentanyl overdoses. Thankfully, our community is equipped with various resources to tackle this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for the relatives and friends of those struggling with addiction. Despite these hurdles, there is much to appreciate about our town. My child's elementary school is staffed with exceptional individuals, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Thanks to the school's supportive environment, my child, who has special needs, has not encountered bullying and truly enjoys attending. An active PTO organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family participation and academic growth. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the school offers free meals to all students, ensuring no child experiences hunger. Families facing financial constraints are treated with dignity, and school-related costs are kept affordable. The City Council has initiated numerous efforts to enhance the town’s appearance, such as road resurfacing, landscaping, and park refurbishments. Regrettably, these improvements are primarily focused on the town center and western side where most shops and traffic are located, often overlooking the eastern part where I live—a source of frustration for many in my neighborhood. All things considered, I genuinely enjoy residing in this town. The people are welcoming, the education system is excellent, and there are sufficient shopping facilities, both small and large, to cater to my family's needs. Our home, while not highly valued, is cozy and serves us well. After 16 years here, my family and I could not picture living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood brims with a vibrant cultural atmosphere. It's perched on a hill and is surrounded by buildings steeped in historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building, directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block down the hill is a fascinating little arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer nights. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see people lined up, eager to get inside. A few blocks up, there's the nearest city park, surprisingly large for this part of town. Encasing the park is concrete, with tall steps integrated into the wall. During the chilly winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. Although it rarely snows, the heavy rainfall during mid-winter makes staying warm a challenge. By pitching their tents close together in the city's center, rather than on the outskirts, they stay warmer. Plus, they're within walking distance of the only family center for miles, where they can shower. What truly captivates me about my city isn't just the beauty of its historic architecture or the majestic buildings scattered across the hills leading to the ocean. It's the cultural essence of the people in my neighborhood. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, you hear tales of federal agents and the DEA sweeping through, attempting to cleanse the streets. These stories persist, passed from generation to generation, even to newcomers like me. Despite being considered one of the city's tougher areas, residents work diligently to maintain its cleanliness and care about their community. There's a saying that if you're white, you shouldn't wander around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning echoes the past, influenced by social conditioning. Perhaps I seem just dark enough to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the persistent reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-driven assumptions, even in a city touted as a melting pot utopia. One thing I know for sure: no matter where I go, Hilltop feels like home. Walking those streets at night invigorates me, as I encounter people who are more inclined to offer me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have kept their doors open a bit longer so I could charge my phone when I had no refuge from the rain. It's a place where I've sat, believing myself invisible, huddled against concrete storefronts on the most dreary nights, only to have someone stop, look me in the eye, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I moved to this area right before starting eighth grade, and initially, it was challenging to make friends. Eventually, I became close with a neighbor two houses away and another who lived on my street. Though they have since moved away, the memories remain. Most of the original residents from when I first arrived are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On weekends or warm days, I often hear children playing outside. It's generally quiet during the week, and I've never experienced any issues with my neighbors. People tend to keep to themselves unless assistance is needed. I frequently order packages online and have never had one stolen from my porch, which speaks to the trust I have in my neighbors. There's a park just a short walk from my house, where I've created many memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with local friends. One of my worst memories involves getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive experiences far outweigh the negative. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who enjoy the swings and slides. The thought of the park fills them with excitement, and it now holds a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, with a variety of cuisines available nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food places are popular here, as in most suburbs, and there are numerous pizza spots. Local stores offer everything one might need, including several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, a Midwest favorite. Some stores reflect the area's diversity; there's an Indian-owned shop for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about others' negative experiences with their neighbors on social media and the news makes me grateful for mine.",
            "I find living in my neighborhood quite enjoyable, mainly because it's conveniently close to my college. The area is predominantly filled with apartment buildings, but there are also a few restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and reasonably priced. Recently, one of the bars changed its name and became more expensive, but the quality of service and drinks remains decent. The community is generally friendly, comprising mainly college students and individuals from lower income backgrounds, as the apartment rents are quite affordable. An elementary school is within walking distance, so there are many children in the vicinity. I haven’t made an effort to get to know my neighbors, nor do I wish to, since they frequently smoke marijuana. In response, the building management amusingly installed an air freshener unit right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I found quite humorous, though it borders on being offensive. \n\nThe buildings surrounding mine tend to look older, although many have updated interiors. Not far from here are some newly constructed apartments, but I'm not fond of them because their construction quality seems poor despite their high rent, which feels like a rip-off. Their proximity to campus allows the management to charge such high prices. There’s an incredibly affordable restaurant about five minutes away that serves food on paper plates, with most dishes being microwaved. Across the road is a gas station, rumored to be an unfavorable workplace. Fortunately, the city funded a road renovation last summer, resulting in a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, which has improved the area’s appearance. \n\nMy apartment building is surrounded by trees, although some have been cut down, leaving a few stumps. However, there are still more trees here than further down the road. Behind my complex is a tree line followed by another apartment set. I reside on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street just behind, which isn’t as well-maintained. Its sidewalks are deteriorating, and most of the buildings appear run-down. The abundance of trees might be an attempt to mask the buildings' condition. Crime is more prevalent in an apartment complex on that street, but it's not limited to there; across the street from me, the apartments also experience crime and have a transient community. Despite everything, I appreciate living here. It’s affordable, and I have access to numerous amenities. The university's proximity is a particular advantage, along with the two bus stops that make trips to the store and downtown convenient.",
            "In my neighborhood, you'll find duplexes arranged around a cul-de-sac. They're spaced in a way that gives the impression of standalone homes, with each one painted yellow and featuring white porches and green metal roofs. Most of us are friendly with each other, gathering at the end of a random driveway some evenings to chat while the neighborhood kids play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing scene in today's technology-driven world, reminiscent of a simpler time. We are surrounded by fields and trees under blue skies with billowing white clouds. However, this season has brought tornado warnings, and for the first time last night, we heard the tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. My larger dog, on the other hand, was too anxious to join us in the bathroom and stayed in the living room, barking nervously at the unusual circumstances. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, except for the sound of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm passed, the road was steaming from the sudden temperature drop—from 92 to 75 degrees in mere minutes. The hail melted instantly upon hitting the warm pavement. As I looked up, the clearing skies revealed the sun and a double rainbow appeared. I dashed inside to grab my camera and quickly captured photos to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were as amazed as I was. The streets remained quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the thunderstorm. Then, life resumed as usual with mothers and children outside while dinner was cooking. It's a welcoming neighborhood for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the southern accents. I have a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, like everyone here. Although the houses look identical from the outside, the apartments vary in size, with some being surprisingly small. This puzzles me. I enjoy walking along the large field behind my place and strolling down to the pond, which isn't suitable for swimming. I've seen deer, and in the mornings, you can hear a giant bullfrog singing. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning begins with the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It's like living in a small, self-contained community village. There's even a donkey on a nearby farm that brays in the evening to remind us of his presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this wonderful neighborhood.",
            "Having spent around a decade here, I feel I can share some insights. When I initially moved to this neighborhood, I felt quite down. Transitioning from Riverdale to Stockbridge was tough; I shed tears over leaving behind what I cherished. My parents, however, had our best interests at heart, seeking improved living conditions and educational opportunities for me and my younger sister. Our new area was perceived as more upscale, offering a better high school and community. Over time, I adjusted, made some new friends, and even a few adversaries at school. I didn't get to know many neighbors well except for Mr. Glen and his kids, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They became like extended family, and I value their presence in my life. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding (a remarriage), which was a delightful event. I aspire to create such joyful memories in the future, hoping to build a prosperous life for my future spouse. During the wedding, Ms. Veda tossed the garter, and I caught it! Unfortunately, I missed out on catching the bouquet. We danced the night away, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with their daughter, Marsharii, though I haven’t seen her since. I hope she’s pursuing great opportunities. The neighborhood is quite intricate, but with GPS, I’ve ventured further. My explorations were mostly with friends Kason and Curtis; we would immerse ourselves in video games and savor life. Occasionally, I take solace in the park, where nature’s tranquility calms me. I practice balancing with sticks from Home Depot and wield a bokken wooden sword when possible. These activities bring me joy. There are also basketball and tennis courts, though I've been away from these sports for some time. However, they remain available should I decide to revisit them. My dad introduced me to tennis alongside my best friend and Mr. Graves, and those sessions, though challenging, were always enjoyable. Reflecting on my time here, countless enjoyable moments come to mind, and I feel optimistic that the future holds even more exciting experiences!",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming little town that might not immediately catch the eye, yet plays a crucial role in agriculture. Johnston proudly carries the title of the Peach Capital of the World, as proclaimed by a sign at the town's entrance. The landscape is predominantly farmland, with peach orchards and cattle fields. Homes outside the town center are spread out, mostly two-story structures with either metal roofs to withstand the intense summer heat or gray shingles. These houses are often set back from the road, leaving room for front fields dedicated to livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, a single traffic light marks a crossroads where all the local stores are situated. Dining options include Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria was once part of this mix but has since closed. A tiny family-run pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, is famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. There's also the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, a small but pricey grocery store. Despite being the only grocery store in town, many residents prefer shopping at a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery needs. The busiest shop in town is Dollar General, offering a wide range of everyday necessities and bustling with activity from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More, a petite furniture store run by a beloved community member, has been a fixture in Johnston for years, complete with delivery services by two movers. Next to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming business providing services like daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both a medical and a veterinary practice are located outside the town center; though small, they are well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. The town has one elementary school, Johnston Elementary School. After fifth grade, students move to a neighboring town for middle and high school. Officially, there are no parks, but plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to offer more family activities and attract visitors and potential residents. While entertainment options are limited—there are no cinemas, bowling alleys, hangout spots, children's playgrounds, pet walking areas, or a wide variety of restaurants—the town's charm lies in its simplicity, small enough to pass by without even noticing.",
            "Nestled in a typical suburban setting, my residence lies in a quaint southern town in Tennessee. Our street serves as a link between two state highways, which results in more traffic than I'd prefer, yet the neighborhood remains serene. The residents here tend to stay put, and I've grown accustomed to the familiar faces in our community. Many engage in routine tasks like yard maintenance. In the colder months, we enjoy sledding down a hill nearby. Situated on the front corner of our street, our home affords us a view of the daily comings and goings, making us familiar with the usual vehicles. Any new car catches our attention. Neighbors often stroll around either for fitness or while walking their dogs. Children bike around, embodying the typical suburban scene. Since our work is home-based, we spend a lot of time at the house. Our family consists of myself, my wife, and our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, and our presence is well-known in the area. We enjoy outdoor activities, even playing in the rain occasionally. Barbecuing on our back deck adds a delightful aroma to our surroundings. Throughout the warmer months, lawn mowers are a constant background noise, as grass grows prolifically until October. Originally a wooded region, our neighborhood is rich in trees, providing ample shade as well as an abundance of leaves to manage each Fall. The scent of burning leaves is a pleasant herald of the season. Recently, our Winters have been mild, blending into an extended Fall. With our garage at the rear, we rarely use the front door, unless there's a rare visitor. I often find myself working on my truck or other projects in the garage, which, when open, connects me more to the neighborhood's pulse. Holidays are subdued here. Thanksgiving and other holidays like Mother’s Day and Christmas bring visiting families and extra vehicles lining the streets. Overall, life here is enjoyable. If the street wasn't a throughway, it would be ideal.",
            "My neighborhood is nestled in the heart of the high desert, characterized by an abundance of dirt and more dirt. For those who haven't lived here, it's hard to truly grasp the constant presence of brown scenery. Spotting a lawn is rare and signals that the homeowner is likely investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s, when I first moved here, houses were sparsely scattered. While that's still somewhat true, there's been a noticeable increase in development. The area increasingly resembles a bustling city, which seems to be a common trend everywhere these days. Generally, the locals are quite welcoming, although, like any urban area, it has its ups and downs. My neighbors are mostly friendly seniors, suggesting it's a pleasant community. Retail options here are mainly chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, one must travel further, as stores like Whole Foods are absent. The job market, as I perceive it, is dominated by construction, likely due to the city's ongoing development and ample open spaces. This rapid growth is somewhat daunting for me; I prefer the current state of things, having left a major city behind and not wanting to return to that lifestyle. My full-time role is in the construction sector, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the aspects I appreciate about my home is the diverse wildlife. People are drawn to the high desert for many reasons, including its stark beauty. The unique climate and landscape create fragile ecosystems that need protection and are home to various wildlife species. Residents should familiarize themselves with these creatures to coexist peacefully. My family has adapted well to the wildlife; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects, and as I write, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. As for attractions, we have a few. Victorville is an excellent destination for families to discover the desert's allure. It offers a distinct experience, especially during the San Bernardino County Fair, which provides a blend of activities and entertainment characteristic of Victorville. Nearby, Wrightwood offers snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons to round out your visit. Those interested in the high desert's natural history and culture should visit the Victor Valley Museum, which houses geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the story of Victorville's societal and industrial development.",
            "When it comes to describing my neighborhood, I suspect my perspective might stand out a bit. Unlike others who might be homeowners living their individual lives, my scenario deviates slightly. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, and my community is comprised of the fellow residents in my dormitory. I also include the broader campus as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with more traditional concepts of a neighborhood. Like any typical neighborhood, mine features houses, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by examining the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. Before diving into the specifics, it's important to clarify the types of housing present in my area. There are three main types of housing nearby: apartments, genuine houses, and dormitory buildings. First, in apartments, there are usually 2-4 individuals sharing a room, with 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type accommodates about two floors, averaging around 20 residents per building. Second, there are actual houses available for individuals affiliated with the school to rent, typically with 2-4 bedrooms, often inhabited by alumni. However, these houses are less common around the neighborhood due to lower efficiency. Lastly, the typical dorm rooms, accommodating hundreds of students, are the most prevalent housing type. Here, rooms are usually shared by two people, with some exceptions. With housing explained, let's move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, which is mirrored in the composition of my neighborhood. People from various cultures and age groups reside here. Most professional staff live in the neighborhood’s houses, while newer students occupy dormitory-style housing and older students prefer apartment-style living. The richness of people in this neighborhood cannot be captured adequately with mere words, so let's shift focus to the stores and parks. Since my school essentially functions as its own self-sufficient neighborhood, it offers a wide array of stores and a single park. The stores include a range of dining options typical of any neighborhood, along with the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Consequently, everything needed can be found within the bounds of my neighborhood! Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for the diverse members of my community and is maintained clean and safe by everyone's efforts!",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are a rare sight. The landscape is mostly sloped, with my home perched atop the steepest incline in the area. Locals have dubbed it the \"exercise hill\" due to the number of joggers who opt to tackle it as part of their fitness routines. Since sidewalks are nonexistent on my street, pedestrians share the roadway. The road itself has a few rough patches, making driving feel a bit precarious. Telephone and electric lines crisscross the neighborhood, appearing somewhat ragged. Frequent rain and storms cause branches and debris to hit the power lines, resulting in repeated repairs that give them a patchy appearance. Tall evergreen trees dominate the scenery. However, many residents are not fond of them; they prefer to cut them down to improve their ocean view. Consequently, numerous homes are built high on the hill with expansive glass-fronted second stories, designed to capture the scenic bay view. The sunsets are particularly stunning, with the water seeming illuminated from beneath and the sky turning a vibrant orange. However, it's often cloudy, and the sunlight typically filters through a haze. Overcast and damp conditions are the norm, leading to moss thriving on surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, and it became moss-covered, taking three hours to clean. Children are scarce here, despite a school being nearby. The neighborhood is predominantly inhabited by older residents, many of whom are retired. Instead of kids, dogs are prevalent, often spotted lounging on lawns or chasing one another down the street. Leaving a door or window open invites the risk of a canine intruder. I once found one in my living room and had to guide it outside. Rabbits roam freely, and gardeners detest them for uprooting plants and burrowing in lawns. My cats, however, enjoy chasing them and have driven most away. Birdlife includes sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle until local crows chase them off. There are no stores nearby, but a short trek downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The lack of a sandy beach is offset by the fun of skipping rocks on the shore. The bay is narrow, allowing a clear view of the opposite shore, even through the mist on most days.",
            "If you're considering a trip to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, finding your way there won't be a hassle! The area is well-served by public transport, which is a favored way to get around in New York City. As an urban neighborhood, you'll definitely get the quintessential New York City vibe. Expect to encounter numerous Asian businesses during your visit. Over the last 20 years, there's been a significant increase in the Asian population in Bensonhurst. As you stroll around, you'll likely come across an Asian-owned shop on nearly every block. Supermarkets and laundromats are especially prevalent. These establishments are quite popular with the locals, thanks to the excellent quality of food at the supermarkets, the affordability, and the convenience. In fact, where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within a two-minute walk of each other, enhancing the ease of grocery shopping. However, it's worth noting that Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian. The neighborhood is quite diverse, with a mix of immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children. Many of the well-known businesses in the area are run by Asians, but you'll also find a newly renovated park nearby. This park features about ten basketball courts, a large field suitable for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a kids' playground, and even a water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. Being in New York City, the parks are naturally very diverse, and you'll find people of all backgrounds playing and interacting harmoniously. The neighborhood lacks large corporate buildings; instead, you'll mostly see co-op buildings or condominium apartments. Most residences are two-family homes. The locals are generally friendly, albeit quite noisy. It's common to hear cars with loud music driving past or engines revving, which can be quite an awakening in the morning. If you visit at night, exercise some caution. While the area is relatively safe, unpredictability is always a factor. Encounters with troublemakers, bullies, or thieves can occur. I, myself, have experienced bullying here long ago through physical assault, and package theft is another issue that occasionally arises. Lastly, despite New York City's regulations on cleaning up after dogs, compliance in this neighborhood is low. Each morning, you might spot at least one instance of dog waste on your way to the train station or supermarket. This is a particular annoyance of mine—dog waste scattered around is something I find bothersome. So, tread carefully and keep your footwear clean!",
            "When you think of Portland, Oregon, the concept of \"weird\" is crucial to grasp. The city's unofficial motto, emblazoned on the back of a building that moonlights as a pizza spot, bar, music venue, and strip club—often skirting legal boundaries—reads \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the '90s and early 2000s—a less renowned and more affordable place that birthed distinctive subcultures. For others, it's an invitation: come to Portland, where being called \"weird\" is a badge of honor. Even with the influx of wealthy Californians and the rise of new condos to house them, Portland retains its quirkiness. Weirdness doesn't guarantee universal acceptance, but it does embrace what typically isn't accepted. It doesn't mean we shun modern conveniences or battles; like much of the country, our goods often hail from China. There are countless ways to be atypical, yet Portland is replete with the ordinary—yoga classes, hipsters, and business professionals abound. Perhaps our weirdness lies in not taking all this too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many across Portland, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes come summer. These boxes, mostly made of cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items people no longer need, often containing unexpected treasures for passersby. They usually contain clothes and books, but could hold anything. The enchanting possibility of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of Portland. At least, that's my take, though I'm just one kind of weird among many. Some residents wouldn't dream of scavenging clothes from a street-side box. They might instead attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with live goats) or cheer at Timbers soccer games. Portland brims with individuals chasing diverse passions—or dreaming of doing so while lingering too long at bars. Yes, Portland faces a drug issue, often linked to mental health struggles exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Homelessness is another challenge, one without clear solutions. The homeless are drawn by Portland's superior social services compared to other regions, though these services still fall short, as they do nationwide. The housed population swings between compassion and hostility. In this aspect, Portland is quite typical.",
            "The mountains are a constant presence. To the north, they observe the sun's path each morning and evening. Even when I overlook them or get too absorbed in my daily routines, they remain, steadfast and indifferent to life's ups and downs. On particularly stressful days, they demand attention, offering solace and strength to continue, one day at a time. I first arrived here when I began my undergraduate studies, and it was the mountains just north of the campus that initially caught my eye. Certainly, the university boasts its own impressive sights with buildings, ponds, and trees that have captured a piece of my heart, but the mountains truly reign supreme. The rest of the town holds its own charm. Numerous cafés have been the backdrop for countless hours of intense study sessions. A short walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where the faded bricks of restaurants and offices exude an air of history. Here, this seemingly suburban town reveals an energy and liveliness comparable to its neighboring city. This vibrant atmosphere, however, doesn't extend far, allowing an easy return to the tranquil small-town vibe past the library. This combination of different atmospheres in close proximity gives the city an enchanting allure, inviting exploration. This setting makes it easy to create many treasured memories tied to various parts of town. Whether it's strolling past the rusted swings in the park with friends after a long night or racing through bustling downtown to catch a movie at the upscale theater with university-provided tickets. Naturally, it also holds difficult memories, as any place in life does. The ponds, in particular, serve as a fitting spot for reflection or late-night emotional release during existential crises, the latter being my more frequent experience. Observing turtles, ducks, and insects going about their lives, each playing a role, I often ponder my own purpose as I navigate the complexities of life. So, I walked beyond the pond, past the park and suburban houses, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees, coloring the sky, and as I glanced up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. Sure enough, there they were, as they always had been. The majestic mountains rose above the hazy blue and yellow sky more prominently than any nearby building, and in their silent grandeur, they reignited my determination.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook this area—it's tucked behind a commercial strip and doesn't seem like a place people would choose to reside. It's a residential area that many wouldn't expect to be inhabited. However, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods and continue behind the hotels, which are mostly vacant except for family gatherings during summer, you'll stumble upon a lively neighborhood. This community is lined with apartment complexes that resemble a series of carefully arranged Russian nesting dolls, each placed with precision along the street. The initial set of apartments has been in the news for some unsavory reasons, so we'll skip over those—appearances can often be misleading. Yet, the neighboring complexes offer a different story, one that remains largely unknown to the locals. Opposite these buildings is a satellite campus of a community college, a peaceful cluster of structures where students, coffee in hand, arrive early in the morning, ready to tackle their day. The gates squeak open to let them in, causing commuters to express their frustration when the increased traffic slows their journey. The road ends at another residential street, bordered by a park and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. This center features inviting porch furniture and a ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Across the street, children play in the park, running across the grass while bees buzz around the flowers. Seniors walk their dogs, casting disapproving looks at the skateboarders and exchanging polite nods with the teenage girls gossiping by the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant offers affordable meals, though it rarely seems crowded. Next door is a swimming supply store and a nail salon nestled in between. Here, you can prepare your pool for summer, get a manicure, and enjoy hibachi chicken all in one trip—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop frequented by teens in the park, who enjoy their cold treats while performing skateboard tricks and vaping, thinking it's the height of coolness. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana, a relic of the unchanging south where time seems to stand still.",
            "The neighborhood I live in is quite intriguing. While most houses are designed for single families, a few have been cleverly divided into two separate units, yet remain attached, which might sound a bit unusual. My house features a modest yard at the front and a small driveway on its left side. Like many others here, it evokes a sense of nostalgia from a time not too distant when suburban life epitomized the American dream. This dream, once warmly embraced by the nation, now feels somewhat distant. Nevertheless, neighborhoods like mine persist, inviting us and visitors alike to believe that this dream is still alive and we strive to hold onto it. The residents may not exude the same optimism as before, and the maintenance of the quaint yards has declined. Yet, there are still cars parked in every driveway, and children playing with the belief that their world is all-encompassing. The local public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking fond memories among the older community members. Although churches are sparse and often empty, the basketball courts remain bustling with activity. Each home has its unique appearance, yet they all share a familiar feel. A significant establishment is Super \"A,\" a large supermarket operated by a Yemeni family, likely the sole Arab family in the area. The community predominantly comprises African American residents. The streets are broad, providing a playground for kids who pause their football games only to let cars pass. Most families have resided here for generations, sharing tales of a past where everyone was acquainted. There used to be a karate school, but as interest waned with fewer karate-themed movies from Hollywood, it transformed into a pharmacy—perhaps a nod to the belief that medicine solves all woes. A small movie theater, offering classic films at reduced prices, draws the older crowd who appreciate its quaint charm, undeterred by its lack of new releases. An expressway skirts our town, though the entry and exit ramps are located in the neighboring town. A proposal once circulated to add an exit for our town; the younger generation supported it, but the elders opposed, fearing it would alter our town's essence, ultimately swaying the city council to reject the idea. A new high school is under construction, and we're in the midst of choosing a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin, perfectly encapsulating the character of our town.",
            "Living in a bustling metropolis, my neighborhood is incredibly diverse. Residential zones intermingle with commercial spaces, which host a myriad of businesses. These range from office complexes to an assortment of shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. The selection of new restaurants to dine at and shops to explore is vast. While some retail outlets are large, recognizable brand names owned by major corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity. They are not just found in shopping centers; they also line the streets, within walking distance of typically tranquil neighborhoods, which become lively due to the many attractions nearby. Additionally, there are a couple of parks in the vicinity, which I often see families with young children enjoying. Regarding the community, there's a remarkable level of diversity here. In a compact area, we have a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a group of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Expanding a bit beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city hosts individuals from a wide range of racial and ethnic backgrounds, though they often cluster into distinct communities. We have areas like Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia, and others, just a few miles away. However, a short distance can turn into an extensive drive. Traveling a mere 10 miles might take up to two hours during peak traffic times. Walking isn't common here, even though some attractions are nearby. The city's vastness and sprawling layout generally deter people from walking. Consequently, we suffer from some of the worst traffic globally, and finding parking is a challenge. Ironically, there's been a surge in construction recently, with new apartment complexes sprouting up. The city attracts many newcomers, but this growth worries current residents, who dread increased congestion on the roads. Housing options in my city are diverse as well. Not everyone opts for high-rise apartment living. Residential areas feature various house types, smaller apartment buildings, and condos. Some properties are single-family homes, while others are duplexes. This diversity in housing is evident even within my neighborhood. The area is also home to people of different ages, and honestly, I don't know most of my neighbors. The community isn't as close-knit as it once was, although I fondly recall my childhood days playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few other friends from the area, who were all around my age.",
            "As we cruised by the endless rows of corn stretching into the horizon, she turned to me and asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" fully aware that the vast, open landscape would be a surprise to her. She hailed from a place where a quick five-minute walk got you to the grocery store—she had never encountered such expansive emptiness before. Captivated by the omnipresent cornfields, I began to explain what it was like growing up in the rural parts of Ohio. It was then that she began to understand my roots and the place I called home. Our journey continued down a narrow country road, eventually leading to a water-filled quarry. Just beyond, lay the modest neighborhood where I reside, characterized by brick and stucco homes. Each house boasts at least half an acre of land, which the residents diligently maintain. Springtime brings an explosion of flowers along with the ever-changing Midwest trees. The driveways host gleaming Mercedes Benz luxury cars, sparkling in the sunshine after a thorough wash. Moving towards my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is often out front, greeting everyone with a smile. He spends his days mowing the lawn, his voice rising above the mower’s hum with cheerful singing. Though his age has softened his sharpness, his genuine nature and fascinating history as a former doctor endear him to everyone. Finally, we arrive at my home. Our side yard is a haven for geese, often pursued by our spirited Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, its sounds mingling with the croaks of bullfrogs and distant cow moos from neighboring farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched sanctuary of wild trees, herbs, and flowers, where I spent much of my childhood. Building tree forts and playfully chasing animals were daily adventures, always shared with a neighborhood friend. Winters here are harsh yet breathtakingly beautiful. The landscape transforms from lush greenery to a stark wilderness, with trees shedding their colorful blooms for bare branches. When snow graces the ground, a magical scene unfolds overnight. Our backyard becomes a canvas for snow angels and snowmen, crafted by my younger sister. Our sibling rivalry often played out through snowball fights, fortified by igloo-like structures built from branches. In this enchanting winter landscape, we played make-believe, oblivious to the world beyond, simply enjoying being carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America, I call a quaint Michigan town my home. Transitioning from expansive farmland to charming tourist spots, our town lacks the typical big-city conveniences. There's no sprawling malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee's in sight. Any destination requires a drive, yet the breathtaking beauty of our surroundings makes it worthwhile. Our town is cradled by water, with the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and picturesque Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are plentiful, inviting you to enjoy the soothing touch of the water.\n\nThe essence of small-town life is embodied in my neighborhood. Homes here aren't lined up in neat rows, nor are they identical in design. These are older residences, some lovingly renovated, others embracing their vintage charm. Most feature full basements visible from the street, and many are clad in classic aluminum siding, showcasing an array of colors. Yards are spacious, often adorned with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and animal enclosures.\n\nOur neighborhood reflects the spirit of Middle America, home to hardworking individuals who are either nurturing families or have done so. Children are often seen playing on the streets, while adults walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors recognize one another, fostering a sense of belonging. Friendly waves and smiles are exchanged, whether it’s someone grilling outside or walking their dog from blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with no fallen leaves lingering from autumn. Green grass is neatly mowed, and any plants or bushes are kept tidy.\n\nThough unassuming at first glance, our neighborhood is ideal for raising a family. It's calm, serene, and secure—a representation of the haven many seek. Within a short walk, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, with the health department nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving the local community. Baseball and softball fields echo with the sounds of games, and the nearby small-town airport contributes the gentle roar of planes taking off and landing. An ice cream shop offers a sweet treat, and downtown is just a walk away. My children can easily bike to the park, a mere eight blocks away. This truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The neighborhood I reside in fits the classic image of suburban life. It's an area where the homeowner's association plays a significant role, ensuring everything looks pristine. As you enter, you'll notice rows of meticulously maintained single-family homes, thanks to the efforts of the homeowner's association. The front yards share a common design: a neat patch of grass, some decorative stones, and short driveways. You might spot a few small trees here and there as well. Garages are typically built for two cars. As you navigate through the streets, you'll find freshly paved roads that are in excellent condition, free from potholes. Most homes are single-story, although there are occasional two-story houses. Instead of individual mailboxes at each house, there's a communal mailbox area at the street's end, much like what you'd find in apartment complexes. Residents use keys to access their mailboxes, and there are larger lockers for package deliveries, another nod to the HOA's preference for uniformity. My home is located on the outskirts of a nearby city, blending both rural and suburban elements. This setting grants us ample land for various amenities. Residents have access to multiple community pools, all well-maintained and gated. There are also several walking trails perfect for dog walks or evening strolls, eliminating the need to visit a park for exercise. The neighborhood is expansive enough to offer plenty of running paths. The community primarily consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where neighbors watch out for each other. However, there is also a mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is larger than it seems population-wise but retains a small-town atmosphere. It offers most of the amenities one would expect, including a single mall that, while not extensive, serves its purpose. A drive of about 15 minutes will take you to a variety of stores, from upscale grocery outlets with organic options to budget stores with limited stock and minimal staffing. Overall, my neighborhood is a secure, well-kept place, offering perks like pools and trails. While shopping isn't immediately nearby, a short drive provides access to all major retail chains.",
            "I first stumbled upon the story of my neighborhood while tuning into a podcast that discussed missing people. It caught me off guard a bit. The rental prices in the area were steep, with most apartments costing over a thousand dollars monthly. It was a tale I hadn't heard before, nor had any of my friends. Perhaps it's the struggle that resonates. Several of my friends often find themselves in tears at night. Life's pricey, yet over time, we've honed our frugality. The scent of old toys from flea markets and clothes with a mothball aroma becomes oddly appealing. Adulthood seems to dull your sense of smell. Whether you start smoking or simply grow used to the environment, it's hard to say. The flea market's presence is constant. The essence of adulthood is captured in dusty magazines piled atop a closed piano, lingering in the leather even post-wash. In this area, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can explore two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio store. The downtown area is bustling, with cars and people crowding the streets each morning, yet the thrift stores remain tranquil. Regardless of the traffic outside, they are serene havens. It's an ideal spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, the influx of cars and people increases. They call it a city in development. Though it serves as headquarters for a major online e-commerce and delivery enterprise, it's still adapting. It evokes memories of New York, a place where everyone is focused on their own pursuits, and little is expected from you. Here, you can maintain your solitude and independence without intrusion. It's unlike the South, where showing concern is equated with care. Here, privacy is respected. You can keep your guard up as long as you wish, with the city's rhythm ebbing and flowing like waves on the shore. It's a vibrant environment. Between the pianist next door and the amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a sense, we have formed less of a group of strangers and more of a community of friends. We unite for necessities, celebrate birthdays, grieve losses, and support each other when possible. I'm fortunate to have landed here. I genuinely appreciate most of my neighbors, and they reciprocate that kindness. I make it a point to tidy up after myself and share food, and they do the same for me. We exchange mail deliveries. It's heartening to see them, and I believe they value my company as much as I do theirs. Though I reside in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, it's the people like my neighbors who reassure me that my life choices haven't been entirely misguided.",
            "Residing in a small Midwestern town just beyond the suburban reach of a big city, my neighborhood on the eastern side represents the town's economically struggling area. Houses here have low property values, with most being rented or owned by individuals with limited income. Nevertheless, the area maintains its charm and appeal. My neighbors are amiable, often acknowledging each other with smiles and greetings as we pass by. Although crime rates are somewhat elevated compared to other town areas, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, a few serious crimes have occurred within blocks of my residence, including shootings and at least one murder. Tragically, our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family has mostly remained untouched by crime, other than the odd item disappearing from our porch when left out. The town has been heavily impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" sweeping parts of the U.S., with fentanyl overdoses claiming many lives. However, numerous resources are available to tackle this crisis, such as addiction recovery centers and Narcan training sessions for those supporting affected individuals. Despite these hurdles, the town boasts several strengths. My son's elementary school excels with a devoted principal, teachers, and staff. Even with his special needs, he hasn't experienced bullying due to the school's positive environment, which he enjoys immensely. The active PTO organizes events throughout the year, encouraging family participation and educational growth. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free meals to ensure no child goes hungry. All children and families receive equal treatment, with affordable school fees, supplies, and field trip costs. The City Council has undertaken efforts to enhance the town's appearance through road resurfacing, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, these improvements mostly benefit the central and western parts of town, where shopping centers and heavy traffic are concentrated, often leaving the east side overlooked, much to the discontent of locals. Overall, I find life in this town satisfying. The community is generally welcoming, the school system is impressive, and there are sufficient shopping options, from small businesses to larger retailers, to meet my family's needs. Although our home's market value is low, it offers comfort and sufficiency. Having lived here for over 16 years, it's hard to envision calling any other place home.",
            "The area where I reside is steeped in cultural richness. It is located on a hill, encircled by structures with significant historical backgrounds. My home is in a seven-story apartment building, directly opposite an old theater, and just a short walk downhill is an intriguing arcade bar attracting a diverse crowd during warm summer evenings. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, people line up outside waiting to enter. A few blocks away, you'll find the city's nearest park, which is surprisingly large given its urban setting. The park is bordered by concrete, complete with tall steps carved into the walls. During the chilly winter months, the homeless population organizes their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalks and broad stairs. Although it seldom snows, heavy rainfall during mid-winter makes staying warm a challenge. By pitching their tents close together, they can maintain warmth in the heart of the city rather than in more remote areas. They are also within a manageable distance from the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing facilities. However, my affection for my city isn't solely due to its historical charm—the towering, proud buildings and the varied architecture descending toward the ocean. What truly captivates me is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop once held a notorious reputation for gang violence on the West Coast. Stories from that era are still shared, even decades later, recounting federal and DEA efforts to clean up the streets. These tales persist, passed down to newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the city's tougher neighborhoods, residents strive to maintain and improve their community. They remain deeply invested in the happenings of their city and their block. Some advise against walking around Hilltop after dark if you're white, a warning echoing from the past and influenced by social conditioning. Perhaps my appearance allows me to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of its own, acutely aware of the societal reminders of racism and cultural biases, even in a city claiming to be a cultural melting pot. No matter how far I travel, Hilltop will always feel like home. Walking its streets at night invigorates me, as I encounter people more likely to offer me a jacket than to threaten me. It's a community where laundromat owners stay open a bit longer so I can charge my phone when I have nowhere else to escape from the rain. It's a place where, on the gloomiest of nights, I've huddled against concrete storefronts, thinking I'm invisible, only to be acknowledged by someone who stops, hands me $5, and assures me of my worth and beauty.",
            "I moved to this area just before starting eighth grade, and initially, making friends was a challenge. Eventually, I connected with a neighbor two houses down and another person on my street. Although they have since moved away, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On warm weekends, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, the area is quiet throughout the week. I've never had any issues with anyone here; people respect your privacy unless assistance is needed. I've ordered many packages online and never had one stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park just a short walk from my home where I've made numerous memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a not-so-great memory of getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive experiences outweigh the negatives. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are much younger and enjoy the swings and slides. They get excited just thinking about the park. It brings back a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of food options nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular and common in suburban areas, along with numerous pizza joints. The local stores offer everything you might need, including several dry cleaners. There's a Walgreens and CVS on the same street, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores reflect the area's diversity, like an Indian-owned shop for those interested in homemade or ready-made Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Seeing stories on social media and the news about others' challenging experiences with their neighbors makes me thankful for mine.",
            "I find living in my neighborhood enjoyable since it's conveniently close to the college I attend. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, but there are also a few restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and reasonably priced. Recently, one of the bars underwent a name change and, although it's a bit pricier, the service and drinks are decent. The people around are generally pleasant, mostly college students or individuals with lower incomes, as the housing here is relatively affordable. There are many children in the vicinity because of an elementary school within walking distance from my apartment. Though I don't know my neighbors and have no desire to, I find it amusing that the building management installed an air freshener unit opposite their door due to their frequent marijuana use. The buildings in my area mostly have an old appearance, though some may have updated interiors. A little further down the street, there are newly constructed apartments, but I dislike them as they were poorly built, despite the high rent, which seems like a rip-off. Being near the campus allows the management to charge more. There's a very inexpensive restaurant about five minutes away that serves food on paper plates and mostly uses microwaves for cooking. Opposite that is a gas station, reportedly not a great place to work. Thanks to city funding, the road was renovated last summer, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, which improved the area's appearance. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, although a few were cut down, leaving stumps, but the greenery is more abundant here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street right behind, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in disrepair, and the buildings appear rundown. There are many trees on this street, likely to obscure the buildings’ condition. Crime is prevalent in an apartment complex on that street, but it's not confined there, as the apartments across from me also experience significant crime and have a transient population. Despite this, I appreciate my living situation. It's affordable, and the proximity to useful amenities is convenient. I particularly value the short walk to the university and the two bus stops that make trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood is nestled in a cul-de-sac filled with duplexes. These homes are arranged in a way that gives the impression of individual houses, despite the fact they're all painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another, although not everyone is. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of one of our driveways, chatting while the neighborhood children play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing break from the modern, technology-driven world, almost like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy white clouds above. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and just last night, for the first time, we heard the tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself clinging to my smallest dog in the bathtub, along with my purse and some pillows. My larger dog refused to join us, staying in the living room, barking nervously at the strange situation. The neighborhood fell silent, save for the clatter of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the rapid temperature drop—from 92 to 75 degrees in mere minutes. The hail melted instantly upon contact with the hot pavement. As the skies began to clear, the sun emerged, and a double rainbow appeared. I dashed inside to grab my camera and quickly snapped photos to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for another hour until residents returned after the thunderstorm. Then, the usual evening scene resumed, with moms and children outdoors while dinners cooked. It's such a friendly neighborhood for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I adore the local southern accents. My apartment, like everyone else's, has two bedrooms and two baths, but while the houses look identical from the outside, the apartments inside can vary greatly, with some being surprisingly small. I enjoy strolling along the expansive field behind my home, eventually reaching a pond that's not meant for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the resonant song of a bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning begins with the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a quaint village community. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm whose braying can be heard in the evening, reminding us of his presence. Discovering this gem of a neighborhood has been a stroke of luck.",
            "Having lived here for nearly a decade, I feel I can share some of my experiences. Initially, when I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was quite upset. I missed my old friends and community, and I cried over leaving them behind. However, my parents wanted a better environment for my sister and me, so we relocated to a place with improved housing and schools that were considered more desirable. Over time, I adapted, made new friends—and a few adversaries—at school. I didn’t connect deeply with many of my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They became like a second family to me, and I genuinely value them. I recall attending Mr. Glen's wedding when he remarried. It was a joyous occasion, and I even caught the garter, though I missed the bouquet! We celebrated all night, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of his daughters, whom I haven't seen since. I hope she’s doing well. The neighborhood can be confusing, but with a GPS, I’ve explored more, especially with friends like Kason and Curtis. We spent countless hours playing video games and savoring life. Sometimes, I find solace in nature at the park, where I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot or wield my bokken, a wooden sword. There are also basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a while. Tennis, in particular, holds fond memories of my dad and Mr. Graves teaching my friend and me. Despite the challenges, we always had fun. There are many cherished memories here, and I believe the future holds even more exciting moments.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina is my charming hometown, a place that might seem ordinary at first glance but holds a notable position in agriculture. Johnston proudly claims the title of the Peach Capital of the World, a fact celebrated on its town sign. The landscape is primarily agricultural, with expanses of peach orchards and cattle farms. Residences outside the town center are often two-story structures, equipped with either metal roofs for summer heat relief or gray shingles, and are set back from the road to accommodate front fields for crops or livestock. \n\nIn the heart of town, a solitary traffic light signals the presence of the community's limited commercial area. Here, one can find three fast-food options: Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a modest burger joint. Sadly, the local pizzeria recently shuttered its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is humorously renowned for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the sole grocery store, though locals often venture to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for larger shopping trips. Dollar General stands as the town's most frequented shop, offering a broad range of everyday items and bustling with activity from opening to closing. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store helmed by a well-regarded local woman, has served the community for many years, even employing movers for furniture delivery. Connected to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering daycare, boarding, and various grooming options. The town's medical needs are met by a small doctor's office and a veterinary practice, both slightly removed from the central area but well-equipped. Johnston Elementary School serves the town's younger students, who then continue their education in the neighboring town for middle and high school. \n\nWhile Johnston lacks parks, a new 2.5-acre recreational area is underway to provide more family-friendly spaces and attract visitors. The town offers limited entertainment options; there are no cinemas, bowling alleys, social spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or diverse dining choices. Nevertheless, Johnston's charm lies in its smallness, a place so quaint you might miss it if you blink.",
            "I reside in a conventional suburban setting in a quaint town in southern Tennessee. Our street connects two major highways, which brings a bit more traffic than I’d prefer, but otherwise, it’s a peaceful community. Not many residents come and go, so I'm quite familiar with the majority of the neighbors. People tend to engage in activities like yard work and other routine tasks. During winter, we take to sledding on a hill along our side street. Our house is located prominently at the street's front corner, giving us a clear view of the daily comings and goings, and we tend to recognize the cars people in the area drive. If an unfamiliar vehicle appears, we usually notice it. Some neighbors enjoy walking for exercise or taking their dogs for a stroll. Children riding bicycles and similar activities are common sights as well. Since we work from home, we spend a lot of time at the house. Our family consists of four members: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen years old. This means the neighborhood is quite accustomed to seeing us around. We frequently enjoy outdoor activities, sometimes even when it’s raining. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the delightful aroma of grilled food. The sound of lawn mowers is a daily occurrence from March until October, as the grass grows vigorously. The neighborhood, once a woodland area, is filled with trees, providing ample shade and an abundance of leaves during Fall. This results in an annual tradition of raking and burning leaves, a task I enjoy due to the pleasant scent of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of Fall. Recently, our winters have been mild, almost blending into an extended fall season. Our garage is located at the rear of our house, making the front door rarely used unless we have visitors, which is infrequent. I enjoy working on my truck and other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays tend to be quiet, though Thanksgiving brings visiting families and extra cars parked along the streets. Similar patterns occur on other holidays like Mother’s Day and Christmas. All things considered, I enjoy living here. If the street weren’t a thoroughfare, it would be ideal.",
            "Nestled in the heart of the high desert, my neighborhood is surrounded by endless stretches of dirt. It's a unique environment that only those who have lived here can truly comprehend—the constant sight of brown all around. If you spot a green lawn, you know the owner is investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were widely scattered. Although there have been numerous new developments, the area maintains its spacious feel. It's beginning to resemble a city more with each passing day, but I suppose this transformation is common everywhere. Generally, the community is quite friendly, though like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood, inhabited by amiable older folks, is probably one of the nicer areas. The local shopping scene is dominated by chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, and for more upscale options, one has to venture out further as Whole Foods and similar stores are absent. The most common job sector here, at least from my perspective, is construction. This is likely because the city is still developing, with plenty of open land available for building. The thought of further development is somewhat daunting to me; I appreciate things as they are now, having left a big city and not wanting to return to that lifestyle. My full-time job is in construction as well—I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. One aspect I cherish about living here is the diverse wildlife. Many people are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty. The unique climate and landscape have fostered ecosystems that require protection and support a variety of wildlife. It's crucial for those living here to understand and coexist peacefully with these natural inhabitants. My family and I have adapted well, and my three children are particularly fascinated by lizards and bugs; as I write this, they’re outside trying to catch some. In terms of attractions, there are a few. Victorville offers a family-friendly desert experience, particularly if you can time your visit with the San Bernardino County Fair—an event that offers a delightful mix of activities. Nearby Wrightwood boasts snow-covered mountains and opportunities for winter sports. For those interested in the high desert's natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum is a treasure trove of geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the story of Victorville's societal and industrial growth.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response might be a bit different from the usual. While many people define their neighborhood in terms of the homes they own and their individual lifestyles, my situation stands out. For me, my neighborhood is the college campus where I reside, and the community consists of the people living in my dormitory. I also view the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser degree. Despite this unusual perspective, my neighborhood does share similarities with the more traditional notion of a neighborhood. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine includes housing, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the types of \"houses\" found in my neighborhood. To clarify, there are three main kinds of housing here: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory residences. In the apartments, each room usually accommodates 2-4 people, with about 4-6 rooms per floor. These buildings generally have two floors, resulting in approximately 20 residents per building. Then there are actual houses, available for rent to those affiliated with the school, often housing alumni. These are typically 2-4 bedroom houses, though they are fewer in number and less common. Lastly, there are the typical dormitory rooms, housing hundreds of students. These dorms usually have two people per room, with some exceptions, and are the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's talk about the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, which is mirrored in the composition of my neighborhood. It hosts individuals from various cultures and age groups. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood's houses, while newer students occupy dorm-style housing and older students tend to live in apartment-style accommodations. It's hard to fully capture the essence of the people in this neighborhood with mere words, so let's move on to the stores and parks. As a self-contained community, my school has an array of stores and a single park. The shops include a variety of dining options, akin to those found in any neighborhood, as well as the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. Thus, everything one might need is available within the boundaries of my neighborhood! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the community's diverse members, maintained clean and safe by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "In the area where I reside, sidewalks are a rarity. The landscape tends to slope downward, and my house is perched at the top of the neighborhood's most pronounced hill. Locals have dubbed it the \"work out hill\" because numerous joggers favor it for their daily exercise. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians often take to the road. The road itself is somewhat perilous, marked by potholes in several spots. The telephone and electric wires encircling the block appear rather worn. Frequent rainstorms in the region lead to branches and debris falling on the power lines, resulting in a patched and mismatched appearance due to constant repairs. Tall evergreen trees are abundant in every direction. However, the community tends to dislike them, striving to remove as many as possible since they block views of the ocean. Consequently, numerous houses are constructed high up on the hill, featuring expansive glass-fronted second stories, all designed to capture the bay view. The sight is breathtaking at sunset when the water seems illuminated from beneath and the sky glows orange. Yet, it's more often cloudy, with sunlight filtering through a haze. Most days feel damp and overcast. Moss proliferates on any available surface: roofs, cars, and railings. Once, I left my car in the driveway for a month, and by the time I returned to it, it was cloaked in a green, mossy layer. It took me three hours to scrape it all away. There aren't many children in my vicinity, even though a school is just a few blocks away. The neighborhood primarily consists of older residents, many of whom are retired. Instead of children, there are numerous dogs. It's typical to see them lounging on lawns or darting down the street. Leaving a door or window open might result in an unexpected canine visitor inside your home. I once found a dog in my living room and had to escort it back out. Wild rabbits populate the area, and some are quite large, much to the dismay of gardeners who find them digging up plant roots and burrowing into lawns. My cats, however, are fond of them and have managed to drive most of them away from our neighborhood. We also see the usual variety of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle making an appearance until the neighborhood crows chase them off. There are no stores nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants offering fresh seafood. The beach is minimal, but the rocks along the shore are perfect for skipping into the water. The bay is relatively narrow; the opposite shore is visible even through the mist on most days.",
            "When planning a visit to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you'll find it quite easy to get there. New York City's public transportation system is highly convenient and widely used. As an urban area, Bensonhurst offers that quintessential New York City vibe. You'll notice a significant presence of Asian businesses throughout the area, as the neighborhood has seen an increase in Asian residents over the past 20 years. Consequently, Asian-owned stores, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are common sights, often appearing on every block. These businesses are popular among locals due to their excellent quality, competitive pricing, and overall convenience. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk of each other near my location, making grocery shopping exceptionally easy. However, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian-populated; it's a diverse neighborhood with a mix of immigrants and first- and second-generation Americans. While many of the prominent local businesses are Asian-owned, the community also boasts a newly renovated park featuring approximately ten basketball courts, a spacious field suitable for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for summer fun. The parks, like the city itself, are melting pots of diversity, where people from different backgrounds come together harmoniously. The area isn't dominated by towering corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op residences, condominiums, and primarily two-family houses. The residents tend to be friendly, albeit quite loud. Expect to hear cars with loud music or revving engines early in the morning. While the neighborhood is generally safe, it's wise to stay alert at night since unpredictable situations can arise. In the past, I've faced bullying and, more recently, package theft has been an issue. Despite fines for not picking up after dogs, many don't adhere to the rules here, so it's common to encounter dog waste on the sidewalks. This is a particular annoyance of mine, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "When you think of Portland, Oregon, it's essential to grasp what \"weird\" truly signifies. The city's unofficial motto, emblazoned on a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music hall, and strip club—while bending the rules in at least half of these roles—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nod to the Portland of the 1990s and early 2000s, a time when the city was less renowned and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being labeled \"weird\" is a compliment. Even with the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant rise of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its quirky essence. \"Weird\" here doesn't always equate to acceptance, but it does mean embracing what typically isn't accepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern conveniences or battles, as we, like the rest of the nation, source most of our goods from China. While there are countless expressions of weirdness, Portland also has its share of normalcy. The city is home to yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals alike. Perhaps being weird simply means not taking life too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others across Portland, we boast vibrant houses, gardens filled with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes during summer. These free boxes, traditionally cardboard but sometimes plastic, are filled with items someone no longer needs. Remarkably often, they hold a hidden gem just right for a passerby. Typically containing clothes and books, they can include anything. The magic of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood encapsulates what the city represents to me, though I am just one type of weird among many. Some residents would never consider picking up clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga, where participants practice yoga with live goats, or cheer at Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a haven for people with diverse passions. It's a place where we chase our dreams, or at least dream of chasing them while spending too much time in bars. Indeed, Portland struggles with drug issues, which often stem from mental health challenges compounded by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. The city also faces homelessness, a problem without a clear solution. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively robust social services, though these are still inadequate, as elsewhere in the country. The non-homeless community oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this respect, we are not unique at all.",
            "The mountains stand constant in the distance, particularly to the north where they observe the sun’s daily rise and fall. Even when life’s busyness engulfs me and I momentarily overlook them, they remain steadfast, indifferent to life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they seem to demand my attention, and when I finally acknowledge them, they offer a quiet solace, helping me gather the strength to press on. I first arrived here as a college freshman, and it was those northern peaks that captured my heart. Certainly, the university itself boasts impressive architecture and picturesque spots such as buildings, ponds, and trees that I hold dear, but it is the mountains that reign supreme in my affections. This town, too, possesses its own charm. Numerous cafés have been my refuge for caffeine-fueled study sessions. A short walk or bus ride to the downtown area reveals a historic charm through its faded brick façades lining the streets with restaurants and office spaces. Here, the town displays a vibrancy akin to its neighboring city. However, this lively atmosphere quickly shifts as one can retreat back to the tranquil small-town feel, simply by passing the library. The juxtaposition of these distinct environments in such close proximity gives the city an enchanting allure that invites exploration. This setting fosters countless treasured memories linked to various parts of town, from late-night strolls by the old swings with friends after pulling an all-nighter, to mad dashes through the bustling downtown to catch a university-sponsored movie at the grand theater. Yet, as with any place in life, it holds its share of painful memories. The ponds, especially, serve as poignant spots for contemplation and the occasional late-night emotional release. I’ve spent many a moment there, pondering life's mysteries while observing the turtles, ducks, and insects playing their roles in nature, which in turn prompted reflections on my own purpose. Wandering past the pond, the park, and the suburban streets, I eventually reached a main road. It was then that the sun illuminated the palm trees, painting a vibrant sky. Looking up at the dawn, I realized my path had led me northward. There they were, as always, the imposing mountains rising above the blue and yellow horizon, silently reinforcing my resilience.",
            "At first sight, you might overlook it—tucked away behind a row of shops lies a residential area you wouldn't expect to find. It’s not exactly a spot where people typically choose to settle down. Yet, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods and meander behind the hotels that fill up only sporadically, mainly during summer family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Along these streets, a series of apartment buildings stand, meticulously arranged like Russian nesting dolls, each carefully positioned beside the next, lining the road. The initial apartments you encounter have made headlines for some questionable activities, so let’s not dwell on those too much—looks can be misleading, after all. However, the complexes adjacent to them reveal a hidden world few locals know about. Across the street from these complexes is a quiet satellite campus of a community college. Here, students shuffle in, clutching their morning coffee and stifling yawns as they start their day at 7 am. The gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters express their impatience by honking and gesturing when traffic slows on busy days. This road meets another residential street at a T-junction, flanked by a park on one side and a rehab center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries on the other. The center features inviting porch chairs and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Meanwhile, children frolic in the park, turning cartwheels on the grass as bees buzz among the roadside flowers. Retirees walk their dogs, frowning at skateboarders and nodding politely to teenage girls sharing gossip at the playground. Nearby, a strip mall houses a sushi restaurant known for its affordable offerings, yet it remains oddly quiet. Next door, a swim supply shop and a nail salon provide convenient services. There, you can prepare your pool for the season while enjoying a manicure and savoring hibachi chicken—all within the strip mall’s confines. A DIY frozen yogurt shop is also part of this mix, where teens from the park often gather, holding cups of yogurt topped with various treats as they attempt tricks on skateboards or vape, considering it the height of coolness. This neighborhood represents a quintessential slice of Americana—a snapshot of history in the tranquil South, where change is slow and time seems to stand still.",
            "The neighborhood I live in has a charm of its own. Many of the homes are designed for single families, though a handful have been cleverly divided into dual residences, yet remain connected in structure. My own house features a modest garden at the front and a small driveway on its left side. Like most homes here, it evokes memories of a past era when suburban life epitomized the American dream. This dream once seemed welcoming to the nation, but now feels as if it's drifting away. However, my neighborhood, like many others, persists in reminding us and our visitors that the dream endures, and we cling to it as best as we can. People don't seem as cheerful as before; the neatness of the small gardens has faded somewhat, yet cars still populate the driveways, and children continue to play as if their surroundings were their entire world. The local public school, standing for nearly 90 years, still fosters aspirations in the younger generation while invoking nostalgia among older residents. The churches are sparse and largely unoccupied, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each house appears different yet carries a similar essence. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a big Yemeni family, seemingly the only Arab family in the area. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are broad, and children often play football, pausing only when cars need to pass. Most residents have lived here for generations, often sharing tales of a time when everyone was acquainted. There used to be a karate school, but as the popularity of karate-themed movies waned, so did the desire to emulate them, leading to its conversion into a pharmacy, since, as they say, medicine solves many problems. Also in the area is a small cinema that screens classic films at reduced rates, attracting the older crowd who appreciate an affordable evening out, sans children, despite its lack of new releases which dissuades the youth. A single expressway runs through my town, though its entrances and exits are located in the neighboring town. A petition once sought an exit for our town; the younger residents favored it, but the elders opposed it, believing it would disrupt the town's character, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and a mascot is being chosen for the town. I think a cyborg with a Southern accent and a log cabin would perfectly symbolize our community.",
            "Living in a bustling city, my neighborhood stands out for its remarkable diversity. Residential zones are interspersed, almost haphazardly, among commercial districts filled with a wide array of businesses. These establishments range from office buildings to shops, dining venues, and entertainment spots. There's no end to the new eateries to try or shops to explore. While some stores are large, well-recognized brands owned by major corporations, the appeal of small boutiques is growing. These boutiques aren't just found in malls; they also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that might be tranquil if not for the numerous attractions nearby. Additionally, a couple of parks are close, where families often visit with their young children. \n\nThe neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity. Within a small area, there's a strong LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish presence, and groups of immigrants and refugees from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate surroundings, the city's diversity broadens even more, with people of various races and backgrounds often establishing their own small communities. For instance, Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia are just a few miles away. However, those few miles can translate into a lengthy drive, especially with the traffic, which can turn a 10-mile journey into a two-hour ordeal during peak times. Despite the proximity of some attractions, few residents choose to walk, given the city's vastness. Consequently, the traffic is notoriously bad, and finding parking is a challenge. \n\nIronically, amidst all this, the city has seen a surge in construction, with large apartment buildings springing up. It seems to be a preferred location, yet current residents often feel disheartened by the thought of more people and cars. Housing in my city is varied. Not everyone desires to live in a towering apartment complex. The residential areas consist of houses of different sizes and smaller apartments and condos. There are single-family homes and duplexes, even within my local area, providing a range of housing options. The neighborhood's residents also vary in age, and I must admit, I don’t know most of my neighbors. It lacks the close-knit feel it once had, though I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few neighborhood friends who were my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we cruised by the seemingly endless corn fields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware she'd be surprised by the vast openness of the countryside. She was accustomed to a town where a quick five-minute stroll would take her to the grocery store—such expansive spaces were foreign to her. As she took in the continuous stretch of corn fields, I recounted my experiences of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she glimpsed into my world and origins. Traveling along a narrow, two-lane country road, you'll encounter a water-filled quarry. Just beyond lies the small community where I reside. The homes here are mainly crafted from brick and stucco, each occupying at least half an acre of land that their owners diligently care for. In spring, vibrant flowers bloom alongside the midwestern trees that transform with each season. Driveways showcase pristine, high-end Mercedes Benz vehicles, sparkling in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. On the way to my grey stucco residence, my Korean neighbor often greets with a warm smile. He dedicates much of his day to lawn care, his singing harmonizing with the mower's drone. He’s a source of amusement in the neighborhood but is genuinely kind and has a fascinating past. With age, he’s lost some of his sharpness. A former doctor, he often blends into the green expanse with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you arrive at my home. The side yard is frequented by geese, persistently chased by our Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, echoing with bullfrogs' calls and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a rustic wooden bridge lies an untouched haven of naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where much of my childhood unfolded. From constructing tree forts to 'hunting' animals (primarily chasing them), there was an abundance of activities and usually a neighborhood friend to join in. Winters in my small town can be harshly cold, yet strikingly beautiful. The yard shifts from lush green to a stark wilderness. The once flower-laden trees become bare, skeletal structures. An infrequent snowfall conjures an overnight winter wonderland. My sister leaves snow angels and builds snowmen in the backyard. We often bickered as children, and during winter, snowball fights were our battles of choice. We'd construct large, igloo-like shelters to store our snowballs, often using branches as our arsenal. In this magical little world, we played make-believe with no other concerns. We were simply carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America, I call a quaint Michigan town my home. Transitioning from expansive farmland to charming tourist spots, our town lacks the typical big-city conveniences. There's no sprawling malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee's in sight. Any destination requires a drive, yet the breathtaking beauty of our surroundings makes it worthwhile. Our town is cradled by water, with the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and picturesque Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are plentiful, inviting you to enjoy the soothing touch of the water.\n\nThe essence of small-town life is embodied in my neighborhood. Homes here aren't lined up in neat rows, nor are they identical in design. These are older residences, some lovingly renovated, others embracing their vintage charm. Most feature full basements visible from the street, and many are clad in classic aluminum siding, showcasing an array of colors. Yards are spacious, often adorned with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and animal enclosures.\n\nOur neighborhood reflects the spirit of Middle America, home to hardworking individuals who are either nurturing families or have done so. Children are often seen playing on the streets, while adults walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors recognize one another, fostering a sense of belonging. Friendly waves and smiles are exchanged, whether it’s someone grilling outside or walking their dog from blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with no fallen leaves lingering from autumn. Green grass is neatly mowed, and any plants or bushes are kept tidy.\n\nThough unassuming at first glance, our neighborhood is ideal for raising a family. It's calm, serene, and secure—a representation of the haven many seek. Within a short walk, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, with the health department nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving the local community. Baseball and softball fields echo with the sounds of games, and the nearby small-town airport contributes the gentle roar of planes taking off and landing. An ice cream shop offers a sweet treat, and downtown is just a walk away. My children can easily bike to the park, a mere eight blocks away. This truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The neighborhood I reside in fits the classic image of suburban life. It's an area where the homeowner's association plays a significant role, ensuring everything looks pristine. As you enter, you'll notice rows of meticulously maintained single-family homes, thanks to the efforts of the homeowner's association. The front yards share a common design: a neat patch of grass, some decorative stones, and short driveways. You might spot a few small trees here and there as well. Garages are typically built for two cars. As you navigate through the streets, you'll find freshly paved roads that are in excellent condition, free from potholes. Most homes are single-story, although there are occasional two-story houses. Instead of individual mailboxes at each house, there's a communal mailbox area at the street's end, much like what you'd find in apartment complexes. Residents use keys to access their mailboxes, and there are larger lockers for package deliveries, another nod to the HOA's preference for uniformity. My home is located on the outskirts of a nearby city, blending both rural and suburban elements. This setting grants us ample land for various amenities. Residents have access to multiple community pools, all well-maintained and gated. There are also several walking trails perfect for dog walks or evening strolls, eliminating the need to visit a park for exercise. The neighborhood is expansive enough to offer plenty of running paths. The community primarily consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where neighbors watch out for each other. However, there is also a mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is larger than it seems population-wise but retains a small-town atmosphere. It offers most of the amenities one would expect, including a single mall that, while not extensive, serves its purpose. A drive of about 15 minutes will take you to a variety of stores, from upscale grocery outlets with organic options to budget stores with limited stock and minimal staffing. Overall, my neighborhood is a secure, well-kept place, offering perks like pools and trails. While shopping isn't immediately nearby, a short drive provides access to all major retail chains.",
            "I first stumbled upon the story of my neighborhood while tuning into a podcast that discussed missing people. It caught me off guard a bit. The rental prices in the area were steep, with most apartments costing over a thousand dollars monthly. It was a tale I hadn't heard before, nor had any of my friends. Perhaps it's the struggle that resonates. Several of my friends often find themselves in tears at night. Life's pricey, yet over time, we've honed our frugality. The scent of old toys from flea markets and clothes with a mothball aroma becomes oddly appealing. Adulthood seems to dull your sense of smell. Whether you start smoking or simply grow used to the environment, it's hard to say. The flea market's presence is constant. The essence of adulthood is captured in dusty magazines piled atop a closed piano, lingering in the leather even post-wash. In this area, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can explore two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio store. The downtown area is bustling, with cars and people crowding the streets each morning, yet the thrift stores remain tranquil. Regardless of the traffic outside, they are serene havens. It's an ideal spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, the influx of cars and people increases. They call it a city in development. Though it serves as headquarters for a major online e-commerce and delivery enterprise, it's still adapting. It evokes memories of New York, a place where everyone is focused on their own pursuits, and little is expected from you. Here, you can maintain your solitude and independence without intrusion. It's unlike the South, where showing concern is equated with care. Here, privacy is respected. You can keep your guard up as long as you wish, with the city's rhythm ebbing and flowing like waves on the shore. It's a vibrant environment. Between the pianist next door and the amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a sense, we have formed less of a group of strangers and more of a community of friends. We unite for necessities, celebrate birthdays, grieve losses, and support each other when possible. I'm fortunate to have landed here. I genuinely appreciate most of my neighbors, and they reciprocate that kindness. I make it a point to tidy up after myself and share food, and they do the same for me. We exchange mail deliveries. It's heartening to see them, and I believe they value my company as much as I do theirs. Though I reside in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, it's the people like my neighbors who reassure me that my life choices haven't been entirely misguided.",
            "Residing in a small Midwestern town just beyond the suburban reach of a big city, my neighborhood on the eastern side represents the town's economically struggling area. Houses here have low property values, with most being rented or owned by individuals with limited income. Nevertheless, the area maintains its charm and appeal. My neighbors are amiable, often acknowledging each other with smiles and greetings as we pass by. Although crime rates are somewhat elevated compared to other town areas, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, a few serious crimes have occurred within blocks of my residence, including shootings and at least one murder. Tragically, our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family has mostly remained untouched by crime, other than the odd item disappearing from our porch when left out. The town has been heavily impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" sweeping parts of the U.S., with fentanyl overdoses claiming many lives. However, numerous resources are available to tackle this crisis, such as addiction recovery centers and Narcan training sessions for those supporting affected individuals. Despite these hurdles, the town boasts several strengths. My son's elementary school excels with a devoted principal, teachers, and staff. Even with his special needs, he hasn't experienced bullying due to the school's positive environment, which he enjoys immensely. The active PTO organizes events throughout the year, encouraging family participation and educational growth. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free meals to ensure no child goes hungry. All children and families receive equal treatment, with affordable school fees, supplies, and field trip costs. The City Council has undertaken efforts to enhance the town's appearance through road resurfacing, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, these improvements mostly benefit the central and western parts of town, where shopping centers and heavy traffic are concentrated, often leaving the east side overlooked, much to the discontent of locals. Overall, I find life in this town satisfying. The community is generally welcoming, the school system is impressive, and there are sufficient shopping options, from small businesses to larger retailers, to meet my family's needs. Although our home's market value is low, it offers comfort and sufficiency. Having lived here for over 16 years, it's hard to envision calling any other place home.",
            "The area where I reside is steeped in cultural richness. It is located on a hill, encircled by structures with significant historical backgrounds. My home is in a seven-story apartment building, directly opposite an old theater, and just a short walk downhill is an intriguing arcade bar attracting a diverse crowd during warm summer evenings. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, people line up outside waiting to enter. A few blocks away, you'll find the city's nearest park, which is surprisingly large given its urban setting. The park is bordered by concrete, complete with tall steps carved into the walls. During the chilly winter months, the homeless population organizes their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalks and broad stairs. Although it seldom snows, heavy rainfall during mid-winter makes staying warm a challenge. By pitching their tents close together, they can maintain warmth in the heart of the city rather than in more remote areas. They are also within a manageable distance from the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing facilities. However, my affection for my city isn't solely due to its historical charm—the towering, proud buildings and the varied architecture descending toward the ocean. What truly captivates me is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop once held a notorious reputation for gang violence on the West Coast. Stories from that era are still shared, even decades later, recounting federal and DEA efforts to clean up the streets. These tales persist, passed down to newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the city's tougher neighborhoods, residents strive to maintain and improve their community. They remain deeply invested in the happenings of their city and their block. Some advise against walking around Hilltop after dark if you're white, a warning echoing from the past and influenced by social conditioning. Perhaps my appearance allows me to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of its own, acutely aware of the societal reminders of racism and cultural biases, even in a city claiming to be a cultural melting pot. No matter how far I travel, Hilltop will always feel like home. Walking its streets at night invigorates me, as I encounter people more likely to offer me a jacket than to threaten me. It's a community where laundromat owners stay open a bit longer so I can charge my phone when I have nowhere else to escape from the rain. It's a place where, on the gloomiest of nights, I've huddled against concrete storefronts, thinking I'm invisible, only to be acknowledged by someone who stops, hands me $5, and assures me of my worth and beauty.",
            "I moved to this area just before starting eighth grade, and initially, making friends was a challenge. Eventually, I connected with a neighbor two houses down and another person on my street. Although they have since moved away, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On warm weekends, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, the area is quiet throughout the week. I've never had any issues with anyone here; people respect your privacy unless assistance is needed. I've ordered many packages online and never had one stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park just a short walk from my home where I've made numerous memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a not-so-great memory of getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive experiences outweigh the negatives. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are much younger and enjoy the swings and slides. They get excited just thinking about the park. It brings back a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of food options nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular and common in suburban areas, along with numerous pizza joints. The local stores offer everything you might need, including several dry cleaners. There's a Walgreens and CVS on the same street, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores reflect the area's diversity, like an Indian-owned shop for those interested in homemade or ready-made Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Seeing stories on social media and the news about others' challenging experiences with their neighbors makes me thankful for mine.",
            "I find living in my neighborhood enjoyable since it's conveniently close to the college I attend. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, but there are also a few restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and reasonably priced. Recently, one of the bars underwent a name change and, although it's a bit pricier, the service and drinks are decent. The people around are generally pleasant, mostly college students or individuals with lower incomes, as the housing here is relatively affordable. There are many children in the vicinity because of an elementary school within walking distance from my apartment. Though I don't know my neighbors and have no desire to, I find it amusing that the building management installed an air freshener unit opposite their door due to their frequent marijuana use. The buildings in my area mostly have an old appearance, though some may have updated interiors. A little further down the street, there are newly constructed apartments, but I dislike them as they were poorly built, despite the high rent, which seems like a rip-off. Being near the campus allows the management to charge more. There's a very inexpensive restaurant about five minutes away that serves food on paper plates and mostly uses microwaves for cooking. Opposite that is a gas station, reportedly not a great place to work. Thanks to city funding, the road was renovated last summer, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, which improved the area's appearance. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, although a few were cut down, leaving stumps, but the greenery is more abundant here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street right behind, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in disrepair, and the buildings appear rundown. There are many trees on this street, likely to obscure the buildings’ condition. Crime is prevalent in an apartment complex on that street, but it's not confined there, as the apartments across from me also experience significant crime and have a transient population. Despite this, I appreciate my living situation. It's affordable, and the proximity to useful amenities is convenient. I particularly value the short walk to the university and the two bus stops that make trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood is nestled in a cul-de-sac filled with duplexes. These homes are arranged in a way that gives the impression of individual houses, despite the fact they're all painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another, although not everyone is. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of one of our driveways, chatting while the neighborhood children play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing break from the modern, technology-driven world, almost like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy white clouds above. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and just last night, for the first time, we heard the tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself clinging to my smallest dog in the bathtub, along with my purse and some pillows. My larger dog refused to join us, staying in the living room, barking nervously at the strange situation. The neighborhood fell silent, save for the clatter of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the rapid temperature drop—from 92 to 75 degrees in mere minutes. The hail melted instantly upon contact with the hot pavement. As the skies began to clear, the sun emerged, and a double rainbow appeared. I dashed inside to grab my camera and quickly snapped photos to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for another hour until residents returned after the thunderstorm. Then, the usual evening scene resumed, with moms and children outdoors while dinners cooked. It's such a friendly neighborhood for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I adore the local southern accents. My apartment, like everyone else's, has two bedrooms and two baths, but while the houses look identical from the outside, the apartments inside can vary greatly, with some being surprisingly small. I enjoy strolling along the expansive field behind my home, eventually reaching a pond that's not meant for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the resonant song of a bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning begins with the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a quaint village community. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm whose braying can be heard in the evening, reminding us of his presence. Discovering this gem of a neighborhood has been a stroke of luck.",
            "Having lived here for nearly a decade, I feel I can share some of my experiences. Initially, when I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was quite upset. I missed my old friends and community, and I cried over leaving them behind. However, my parents wanted a better environment for my sister and me, so we relocated to a place with improved housing and schools that were considered more desirable. Over time, I adapted, made new friends—and a few adversaries—at school. I didn’t connect deeply with many of my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They became like a second family to me, and I genuinely value them. I recall attending Mr. Glen's wedding when he remarried. It was a joyous occasion, and I even caught the garter, though I missed the bouquet! We celebrated all night, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of his daughters, whom I haven't seen since. I hope she’s doing well. The neighborhood can be confusing, but with a GPS, I’ve explored more, especially with friends like Kason and Curtis. We spent countless hours playing video games and savoring life. Sometimes, I find solace in nature at the park, where I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot or wield my bokken, a wooden sword. There are also basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a while. Tennis, in particular, holds fond memories of my dad and Mr. Graves teaching my friend and me. Despite the challenges, we always had fun. There are many cherished memories here, and I believe the future holds even more exciting moments.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina is my charming hometown, a place that might seem ordinary at first glance but holds a notable position in agriculture. Johnston proudly claims the title of the Peach Capital of the World, a fact celebrated on its town sign. The landscape is primarily agricultural, with expanses of peach orchards and cattle farms. Residences outside the town center are often two-story structures, equipped with either metal roofs for summer heat relief or gray shingles, and are set back from the road to accommodate front fields for crops or livestock. \n\nIn the heart of town, a solitary traffic light signals the presence of the community's limited commercial area. Here, one can find three fast-food options: Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a modest burger joint. Sadly, the local pizzeria recently shuttered its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is humorously renowned for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the sole grocery store, though locals often venture to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for larger shopping trips. Dollar General stands as the town's most frequented shop, offering a broad range of everyday items and bustling with activity from opening to closing. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store helmed by a well-regarded local woman, has served the community for many years, even employing movers for furniture delivery. Connected to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering daycare, boarding, and various grooming options. The town's medical needs are met by a small doctor's office and a veterinary practice, both slightly removed from the central area but well-equipped. Johnston Elementary School serves the town's younger students, who then continue their education in the neighboring town for middle and high school. \n\nWhile Johnston lacks parks, a new 2.5-acre recreational area is underway to provide more family-friendly spaces and attract visitors. The town offers limited entertainment options; there are no cinemas, bowling alleys, social spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or diverse dining choices. Nevertheless, Johnston's charm lies in its smallness, a place so quaint you might miss it if you blink.",
            "I reside in a conventional suburban setting in a quaint town in southern Tennessee. Our street connects two major highways, which brings a bit more traffic than I’d prefer, but otherwise, it’s a peaceful community. Not many residents come and go, so I'm quite familiar with the majority of the neighbors. People tend to engage in activities like yard work and other routine tasks. During winter, we take to sledding on a hill along our side street. Our house is located prominently at the street's front corner, giving us a clear view of the daily comings and goings, and we tend to recognize the cars people in the area drive. If an unfamiliar vehicle appears, we usually notice it. Some neighbors enjoy walking for exercise or taking their dogs for a stroll. Children riding bicycles and similar activities are common sights as well. Since we work from home, we spend a lot of time at the house. Our family consists of four members: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen years old. This means the neighborhood is quite accustomed to seeing us around. We frequently enjoy outdoor activities, sometimes even when it’s raining. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the delightful aroma of grilled food. The sound of lawn mowers is a daily occurrence from March until October, as the grass grows vigorously. The neighborhood, once a woodland area, is filled with trees, providing ample shade and an abundance of leaves during Fall. This results in an annual tradition of raking and burning leaves, a task I enjoy due to the pleasant scent of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of Fall. Recently, our winters have been mild, almost blending into an extended fall season. Our garage is located at the rear of our house, making the front door rarely used unless we have visitors, which is infrequent. I enjoy working on my truck and other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays tend to be quiet, though Thanksgiving brings visiting families and extra cars parked along the streets. Similar patterns occur on other holidays like Mother’s Day and Christmas. All things considered, I enjoy living here. If the street weren’t a thoroughfare, it would be ideal.",
            "Nestled in the heart of the high desert, my neighborhood is surrounded by endless stretches of dirt. It's a unique environment that only those who have lived here can truly comprehend—the constant sight of brown all around. If you spot a green lawn, you know the owner is investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were widely scattered. Although there have been numerous new developments, the area maintains its spacious feel. It's beginning to resemble a city more with each passing day, but I suppose this transformation is common everywhere. Generally, the community is quite friendly, though like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood, inhabited by amiable older folks, is probably one of the nicer areas. The local shopping scene is dominated by chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, and for more upscale options, one has to venture out further as Whole Foods and similar stores are absent. The most common job sector here, at least from my perspective, is construction. This is likely because the city is still developing, with plenty of open land available for building. The thought of further development is somewhat daunting to me; I appreciate things as they are now, having left a big city and not wanting to return to that lifestyle. My full-time job is in construction as well—I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. One aspect I cherish about living here is the diverse wildlife. Many people are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty. The unique climate and landscape have fostered ecosystems that require protection and support a variety of wildlife. It's crucial for those living here to understand and coexist peacefully with these natural inhabitants. My family and I have adapted well, and my three children are particularly fascinated by lizards and bugs; as I write this, they’re outside trying to catch some. In terms of attractions, there are a few. Victorville offers a family-friendly desert experience, particularly if you can time your visit with the San Bernardino County Fair—an event that offers a delightful mix of activities. Nearby Wrightwood boasts snow-covered mountains and opportunities for winter sports. For those interested in the high desert's natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum is a treasure trove of geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the story of Victorville's societal and industrial growth.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response might be a bit different from the usual. While many people define their neighborhood in terms of the homes they own and their individual lifestyles, my situation stands out. For me, my neighborhood is the college campus where I reside, and the community consists of the people living in my dormitory. I also view the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser degree. Despite this unusual perspective, my neighborhood does share similarities with the more traditional notion of a neighborhood. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine includes housing, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the types of \"houses\" found in my neighborhood. To clarify, there are three main kinds of housing here: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory residences. In the apartments, each room usually accommodates 2-4 people, with about 4-6 rooms per floor. These buildings generally have two floors, resulting in approximately 20 residents per building. Then there are actual houses, available for rent to those affiliated with the school, often housing alumni. These are typically 2-4 bedroom houses, though they are fewer in number and less common. Lastly, there are the typical dormitory rooms, housing hundreds of students. These dorms usually have two people per room, with some exceptions, and are the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's talk about the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, which is mirrored in the composition of my neighborhood. It hosts individuals from various cultures and age groups. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood's houses, while newer students occupy dorm-style housing and older students tend to live in apartment-style accommodations. It's hard to fully capture the essence of the people in this neighborhood with mere words, so let's move on to the stores and parks. As a self-contained community, my school has an array of stores and a single park. The shops include a variety of dining options, akin to those found in any neighborhood, as well as the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. Thus, everything one might need is available within the boundaries of my neighborhood! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the community's diverse members, maintained clean and safe by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "In the area where I reside, sidewalks are a rarity. The landscape tends to slope downward, and my house is perched at the top of the neighborhood's most pronounced hill. Locals have dubbed it the \"work out hill\" because numerous joggers favor it for their daily exercise. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians often take to the road. The road itself is somewhat perilous, marked by potholes in several spots. The telephone and electric wires encircling the block appear rather worn. Frequent rainstorms in the region lead to branches and debris falling on the power lines, resulting in a patched and mismatched appearance due to constant repairs. Tall evergreen trees are abundant in every direction. However, the community tends to dislike them, striving to remove as many as possible since they block views of the ocean. Consequently, numerous houses are constructed high up on the hill, featuring expansive glass-fronted second stories, all designed to capture the bay view. The sight is breathtaking at sunset when the water seems illuminated from beneath and the sky glows orange. Yet, it's more often cloudy, with sunlight filtering through a haze. Most days feel damp and overcast. Moss proliferates on any available surface: roofs, cars, and railings. Once, I left my car in the driveway for a month, and by the time I returned to it, it was cloaked in a green, mossy layer. It took me three hours to scrape it all away. There aren't many children in my vicinity, even though a school is just a few blocks away. The neighborhood primarily consists of older residents, many of whom are retired. Instead of children, there are numerous dogs. It's typical to see them lounging on lawns or darting down the street. Leaving a door or window open might result in an unexpected canine visitor inside your home. I once found a dog in my living room and had to escort it back out. Wild rabbits populate the area, and some are quite large, much to the dismay of gardeners who find them digging up plant roots and burrowing into lawns. My cats, however, are fond of them and have managed to drive most of them away from our neighborhood. We also see the usual variety of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle making an appearance until the neighborhood crows chase them off. There are no stores nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants offering fresh seafood. The beach is minimal, but the rocks along the shore are perfect for skipping into the water. The bay is relatively narrow; the opposite shore is visible even through the mist on most days.",
            "When planning a visit to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you'll find it quite easy to get there. New York City's public transportation system is highly convenient and widely used. As an urban area, Bensonhurst offers that quintessential New York City vibe. You'll notice a significant presence of Asian businesses throughout the area, as the neighborhood has seen an increase in Asian residents over the past 20 years. Consequently, Asian-owned stores, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are common sights, often appearing on every block. These businesses are popular among locals due to their excellent quality, competitive pricing, and overall convenience. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk of each other near my location, making grocery shopping exceptionally easy. However, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian-populated; it's a diverse neighborhood with a mix of immigrants and first- and second-generation Americans. While many of the prominent local businesses are Asian-owned, the community also boasts a newly renovated park featuring approximately ten basketball courts, a spacious field suitable for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for summer fun. The parks, like the city itself, are melting pots of diversity, where people from different backgrounds come together harmoniously. The area isn't dominated by towering corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op residences, condominiums, and primarily two-family houses. The residents tend to be friendly, albeit quite loud. Expect to hear cars with loud music or revving engines early in the morning. While the neighborhood is generally safe, it's wise to stay alert at night since unpredictable situations can arise. In the past, I've faced bullying and, more recently, package theft has been an issue. Despite fines for not picking up after dogs, many don't adhere to the rules here, so it's common to encounter dog waste on the sidewalks. This is a particular annoyance of mine, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "When you think of Portland, Oregon, it's essential to grasp what \"weird\" truly signifies. The city's unofficial motto, emblazoned on a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music hall, and strip club—while bending the rules in at least half of these roles—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nod to the Portland of the 1990s and early 2000s, a time when the city was less renowned and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being labeled \"weird\" is a compliment. Even with the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant rise of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its quirky essence. \"Weird\" here doesn't always equate to acceptance, but it does mean embracing what typically isn't accepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern conveniences or battles, as we, like the rest of the nation, source most of our goods from China. While there are countless expressions of weirdness, Portland also has its share of normalcy. The city is home to yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals alike. Perhaps being weird simply means not taking life too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others across Portland, we boast vibrant houses, gardens filled with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes during summer. These free boxes, traditionally cardboard but sometimes plastic, are filled with items someone no longer needs. Remarkably often, they hold a hidden gem just right for a passerby. Typically containing clothes and books, they can include anything. The magic of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood encapsulates what the city represents to me, though I am just one type of weird among many. Some residents would never consider picking up clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga, where participants practice yoga with live goats, or cheer at Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a haven for people with diverse passions. It's a place where we chase our dreams, or at least dream of chasing them while spending too much time in bars. Indeed, Portland struggles with drug issues, which often stem from mental health challenges compounded by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. The city also faces homelessness, a problem without a clear solution. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively robust social services, though these are still inadequate, as elsewhere in the country. The non-homeless community oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this respect, we are not unique at all.",
            "The mountains stand constant in the distance, particularly to the north where they observe the sun’s daily rise and fall. Even when life’s busyness engulfs me and I momentarily overlook them, they remain steadfast, indifferent to life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they seem to demand my attention, and when I finally acknowledge them, they offer a quiet solace, helping me gather the strength to press on. I first arrived here as a college freshman, and it was those northern peaks that captured my heart. Certainly, the university itself boasts impressive architecture and picturesque spots such as buildings, ponds, and trees that I hold dear, but it is the mountains that reign supreme in my affections. This town, too, possesses its own charm. Numerous cafés have been my refuge for caffeine-fueled study sessions. A short walk or bus ride to the downtown area reveals a historic charm through its faded brick façades lining the streets with restaurants and office spaces. Here, the town displays a vibrancy akin to its neighboring city. However, this lively atmosphere quickly shifts as one can retreat back to the tranquil small-town feel, simply by passing the library. The juxtaposition of these distinct environments in such close proximity gives the city an enchanting allure that invites exploration. This setting fosters countless treasured memories linked to various parts of town, from late-night strolls by the old swings with friends after pulling an all-nighter, to mad dashes through the bustling downtown to catch a university-sponsored movie at the grand theater. Yet, as with any place in life, it holds its share of painful memories. The ponds, especially, serve as poignant spots for contemplation and the occasional late-night emotional release. I’ve spent many a moment there, pondering life's mysteries while observing the turtles, ducks, and insects playing their roles in nature, which in turn prompted reflections on my own purpose. Wandering past the pond, the park, and the suburban streets, I eventually reached a main road. It was then that the sun illuminated the palm trees, painting a vibrant sky. Looking up at the dawn, I realized my path had led me northward. There they were, as always, the imposing mountains rising above the blue and yellow horizon, silently reinforcing my resilience.",
            "At first sight, you might overlook it—tucked away behind a row of shops lies a residential area you wouldn't expect to find. It’s not exactly a spot where people typically choose to settle down. Yet, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods and meander behind the hotels that fill up only sporadically, mainly during summer family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Along these streets, a series of apartment buildings stand, meticulously arranged like Russian nesting dolls, each carefully positioned beside the next, lining the road. The initial apartments you encounter have made headlines for some questionable activities, so let’s not dwell on those too much—looks can be misleading, after all. However, the complexes adjacent to them reveal a hidden world few locals know about. Across the street from these complexes is a quiet satellite campus of a community college. Here, students shuffle in, clutching their morning coffee and stifling yawns as they start their day at 7 am. The gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters express their impatience by honking and gesturing when traffic slows on busy days. This road meets another residential street at a T-junction, flanked by a park on one side and a rehab center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries on the other. The center features inviting porch chairs and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Meanwhile, children frolic in the park, turning cartwheels on the grass as bees buzz among the roadside flowers. Retirees walk their dogs, frowning at skateboarders and nodding politely to teenage girls sharing gossip at the playground. Nearby, a strip mall houses a sushi restaurant known for its affordable offerings, yet it remains oddly quiet. Next door, a swim supply shop and a nail salon provide convenient services. There, you can prepare your pool for the season while enjoying a manicure and savoring hibachi chicken—all within the strip mall’s confines. A DIY frozen yogurt shop is also part of this mix, where teens from the park often gather, holding cups of yogurt topped with various treats as they attempt tricks on skateboards or vape, considering it the height of coolness. This neighborhood represents a quintessential slice of Americana—a snapshot of history in the tranquil South, where change is slow and time seems to stand still.",
            "The neighborhood I live in has a charm of its own. Many of the homes are designed for single families, though a handful have been cleverly divided into dual residences, yet remain connected in structure. My own house features a modest garden at the front and a small driveway on its left side. Like most homes here, it evokes memories of a past era when suburban life epitomized the American dream. This dream once seemed welcoming to the nation, but now feels as if it's drifting away. However, my neighborhood, like many others, persists in reminding us and our visitors that the dream endures, and we cling to it as best as we can. People don't seem as cheerful as before; the neatness of the small gardens has faded somewhat, yet cars still populate the driveways, and children continue to play as if their surroundings were their entire world. The local public school, standing for nearly 90 years, still fosters aspirations in the younger generation while invoking nostalgia among older residents. The churches are sparse and largely unoccupied, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each house appears different yet carries a similar essence. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a big Yemeni family, seemingly the only Arab family in the area. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are broad, and children often play football, pausing only when cars need to pass. Most residents have lived here for generations, often sharing tales of a time when everyone was acquainted. There used to be a karate school, but as the popularity of karate-themed movies waned, so did the desire to emulate them, leading to its conversion into a pharmacy, since, as they say, medicine solves many problems. Also in the area is a small cinema that screens classic films at reduced rates, attracting the older crowd who appreciate an affordable evening out, sans children, despite its lack of new releases which dissuades the youth. A single expressway runs through my town, though its entrances and exits are located in the neighboring town. A petition once sought an exit for our town; the younger residents favored it, but the elders opposed it, believing it would disrupt the town's character, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and a mascot is being chosen for the town. I think a cyborg with a Southern accent and a log cabin would perfectly symbolize our community.",
            "Living in a bustling city, my neighborhood stands out for its remarkable diversity. Residential zones are interspersed, almost haphazardly, among commercial districts filled with a wide array of businesses. These establishments range from office buildings to shops, dining venues, and entertainment spots. There's no end to the new eateries to try or shops to explore. While some stores are large, well-recognized brands owned by major corporations, the appeal of small boutiques is growing. These boutiques aren't just found in malls; they also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that might be tranquil if not for the numerous attractions nearby. Additionally, a couple of parks are close, where families often visit with their young children. \n\nThe neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity. Within a small area, there's a strong LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish presence, and groups of immigrants and refugees from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate surroundings, the city's diversity broadens even more, with people of various races and backgrounds often establishing their own small communities. For instance, Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia are just a few miles away. However, those few miles can translate into a lengthy drive, especially with the traffic, which can turn a 10-mile journey into a two-hour ordeal during peak times. Despite the proximity of some attractions, few residents choose to walk, given the city's vastness. Consequently, the traffic is notoriously bad, and finding parking is a challenge. \n\nIronically, amidst all this, the city has seen a surge in construction, with large apartment buildings springing up. It seems to be a preferred location, yet current residents often feel disheartened by the thought of more people and cars. Housing in my city is varied. Not everyone desires to live in a towering apartment complex. The residential areas consist of houses of different sizes and smaller apartments and condos. There are single-family homes and duplexes, even within my local area, providing a range of housing options. The neighborhood's residents also vary in age, and I must admit, I don’t know most of my neighbors. It lacks the close-knit feel it once had, though I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few neighborhood friends who were my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we cruised by the seemingly endless corn fields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware she'd be surprised by the vast openness of the countryside. She was accustomed to a town where a quick five-minute stroll would take her to the grocery store—such expansive spaces were foreign to her. As she took in the continuous stretch of corn fields, I recounted my experiences of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she glimpsed into my world and origins. Traveling along a narrow, two-lane country road, you'll encounter a water-filled quarry. Just beyond lies the small community where I reside. The homes here are mainly crafted from brick and stucco, each occupying at least half an acre of land that their owners diligently care for. In spring, vibrant flowers bloom alongside the midwestern trees that transform with each season. Driveways showcase pristine, high-end Mercedes Benz vehicles, sparkling in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. On the way to my grey stucco residence, my Korean neighbor often greets with a warm smile. He dedicates much of his day to lawn care, his singing harmonizing with the mower's drone. He’s a source of amusement in the neighborhood but is genuinely kind and has a fascinating past. With age, he’s lost some of his sharpness. A former doctor, he often blends into the green expanse with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you arrive at my home. The side yard is frequented by geese, persistently chased by our Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, echoing with bullfrogs' calls and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a rustic wooden bridge lies an untouched haven of naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where much of my childhood unfolded. From constructing tree forts to 'hunting' animals (primarily chasing them), there was an abundance of activities and usually a neighborhood friend to join in. Winters in my small town can be harshly cold, yet strikingly beautiful. The yard shifts from lush green to a stark wilderness. The once flower-laden trees become bare, skeletal structures. An infrequent snowfall conjures an overnight winter wonderland. My sister leaves snow angels and builds snowmen in the backyard. We often bickered as children, and during winter, snowball fights were our battles of choice. We'd construct large, igloo-like shelters to store our snowballs, often using branches as our arsenal. In this magical little world, we played make-believe with no other concerns. We were simply carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way.

            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America, I call a quaint Michigan town my home. Transitioning from expansive farmland to charming tourist spots, our town lacks the typical big-city conveniences. There's no sprawling malls, no Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee's in sight. Any destination requires a drive, yet the breathtaking beauty of our surroundings makes it worthwhile. Our town is cradled by water, with the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and picturesque Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are plentiful, inviting you to enjoy the soothing touch of the water.\n\nThe essence of small-town life is embodied in my neighborhood. Homes here aren't lined up in neat rows, nor are they identical in design. These are older residences, some lovingly renovated, others embracing their vintage charm. Most feature full basements visible from the street, and many are clad in classic aluminum siding, showcasing an array of colors. Yards are spacious, often adorned with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and animal enclosures.\n\nOur neighborhood reflects the spirit of Middle America, home to hardworking individuals who are either nurturing families or have done so. Children are often seen playing on the streets, while adults walk dogs, bike, or rollerblade. Neighbors recognize one another, fostering a sense of belonging. Friendly waves and smiles are exchanged, whether it’s someone grilling outside or walking their dog from blocks away. Lawns are well-maintained, with no fallen leaves lingering from autumn. Green grass is neatly mowed, and any plants or bushes are kept tidy.\n\nThough unassuming at first glance, our neighborhood is ideal for raising a family. It's calm, serene, and secure—a representation of the haven many seek. Within a short walk, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, with the health department nearby. The city recycling center is just down the road, serving the local community. Baseball and softball fields echo with the sounds of games, and the nearby small-town airport contributes the gentle roar of planes taking off and landing. An ice cream shop offers a sweet treat, and downtown is just a walk away. My children can easily bike to the park, a mere eight blocks away. This truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The neighborhood I reside in fits the classic image of suburban life. It's an area where the homeowner's association plays a significant role, ensuring everything looks pristine. As you enter, you'll notice rows of meticulously maintained single-family homes, thanks to the efforts of the homeowner's association. The front yards share a common design: a neat patch of grass, some decorative stones, and short driveways. You might spot a few small trees here and there as well. Garages are typically built for two cars. As you navigate through the streets, you'll find freshly paved roads that are in excellent condition, free from potholes. Most homes are single-story, although there are occasional two-story houses. Instead of individual mailboxes at each house, there's a communal mailbox area at the street's end, much like what you'd find in apartment complexes. Residents use keys to access their mailboxes, and there are larger lockers for package deliveries, another nod to the HOA's preference for uniformity. My home is located on the outskirts of a nearby city, blending both rural and suburban elements. This setting grants us ample land for various amenities. Residents have access to multiple community pools, all well-maintained and gated. There are also several walking trails perfect for dog walks or evening strolls, eliminating the need to visit a park for exercise. The neighborhood is expansive enough to offer plenty of running paths. The community primarily consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where neighbors watch out for each other. However, there is also a mix of middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is larger than it seems population-wise but retains a small-town atmosphere. It offers most of the amenities one would expect, including a single mall that, while not extensive, serves its purpose. A drive of about 15 minutes will take you to a variety of stores, from upscale grocery outlets with organic options to budget stores with limited stock and minimal staffing. Overall, my neighborhood is a secure, well-kept place, offering perks like pools and trails. While shopping isn't immediately nearby, a short drive provides access to all major retail chains.",
            "I first stumbled upon the story of my neighborhood while tuning into a podcast that discussed missing people. It caught me off guard a bit. The rental prices in the area were steep, with most apartments costing over a thousand dollars monthly. It was a tale I hadn't heard before, nor had any of my friends. Perhaps it's the struggle that resonates. Several of my friends often find themselves in tears at night. Life's pricey, yet over time, we've honed our frugality. The scent of old toys from flea markets and clothes with a mothball aroma becomes oddly appealing. Adulthood seems to dull your sense of smell. Whether you start smoking or simply grow used to the environment, it's hard to say. The flea market's presence is constant. The essence of adulthood is captured in dusty magazines piled atop a closed piano, lingering in the leather even post-wash. In this area, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. Starting from one end, you can explore two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio store. The downtown area is bustling, with cars and people crowding the streets each morning, yet the thrift stores remain tranquil. Regardless of the traffic outside, they are serene havens. It's an ideal spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, the influx of cars and people increases. They call it a city in development. Though it serves as headquarters for a major online e-commerce and delivery enterprise, it's still adapting. It evokes memories of New York, a place where everyone is focused on their own pursuits, and little is expected from you. Here, you can maintain your solitude and independence without intrusion. It's unlike the South, where showing concern is equated with care. Here, privacy is respected. You can keep your guard up as long as you wish, with the city's rhythm ebbing and flowing like waves on the shore. It's a vibrant environment. Between the pianist next door and the amateur singers upstairs, there's always activity. In a sense, we have formed less of a group of strangers and more of a community of friends. We unite for necessities, celebrate birthdays, grieve losses, and support each other when possible. I'm fortunate to have landed here. I genuinely appreciate most of my neighbors, and they reciprocate that kindness. I make it a point to tidy up after myself and share food, and they do the same for me. We exchange mail deliveries. It's heartening to see them, and I believe they value my company as much as I do theirs. Though I reside in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, it's the people like my neighbors who reassure me that my life choices haven't been entirely misguided.",
            "Residing in a small Midwestern town just beyond the suburban reach of a big city, my neighborhood on the eastern side represents the town's economically struggling area. Houses here have low property values, with most being rented or owned by individuals with limited income. Nevertheless, the area maintains its charm and appeal. My neighbors are amiable, often acknowledging each other with smiles and greetings as we pass by. Although crime rates are somewhat elevated compared to other town areas, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, a few serious crimes have occurred within blocks of my residence, including shootings and at least one murder. Tragically, our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family has mostly remained untouched by crime, other than the odd item disappearing from our porch when left out. The town has been heavily impacted by the \"opioid epidemic\" sweeping parts of the U.S., with fentanyl overdoses claiming many lives. However, numerous resources are available to tackle this crisis, such as addiction recovery centers and Narcan training sessions for those supporting affected individuals. Despite these hurdles, the town boasts several strengths. My son's elementary school excels with a devoted principal, teachers, and staff. Even with his special needs, he hasn't experienced bullying due to the school's positive environment, which he enjoys immensely. The active PTO organizes events throughout the year, encouraging family participation and educational growth. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free meals to ensure no child goes hungry. All children and families receive equal treatment, with affordable school fees, supplies, and field trip costs. The City Council has undertaken efforts to enhance the town's appearance through road resurfacing, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, these improvements mostly benefit the central and western parts of town, where shopping centers and heavy traffic are concentrated, often leaving the east side overlooked, much to the discontent of locals. Overall, I find life in this town satisfying. The community is generally welcoming, the school system is impressive, and there are sufficient shopping options, from small businesses to larger retailers, to meet my family's needs. Although our home's market value is low, it offers comfort and sufficiency. Having lived here for over 16 years, it's hard to envision calling any other place home.",
            "The area where I reside is steeped in cultural richness. It is located on a hill, encircled by structures with significant historical backgrounds. My home is in a seven-story apartment building, directly opposite an old theater, and just a short walk downhill is an intriguing arcade bar attracting a diverse crowd during warm summer evenings. Often, especially on weekends in June and July, people line up outside waiting to enter. A few blocks away, you'll find the city's nearest park, which is surprisingly large given its urban setting. The park is bordered by concrete, complete with tall steps carved into the walls. During the chilly winter months, the homeless population organizes their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalks and broad stairs. Although it seldom snows, heavy rainfall during mid-winter makes staying warm a challenge. By pitching their tents close together, they can maintain warmth in the heart of the city rather than in more remote areas. They are also within a manageable distance from the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing facilities. However, my affection for my city isn't solely due to its historical charm—the towering, proud buildings and the varied architecture descending toward the ocean. What truly captivates me is the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop once held a notorious reputation for gang violence on the West Coast. Stories from that era are still shared, even decades later, recounting federal and DEA efforts to clean up the streets. These tales persist, passed down to newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the city's tougher neighborhoods, residents strive to maintain and improve their community. They remain deeply invested in the happenings of their city and their block. Some advise against walking around Hilltop after dark if you're white, a warning echoing from the past and influenced by social conditioning. Perhaps my appearance allows me to blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of its own, acutely aware of the societal reminders of racism and cultural biases, even in a city claiming to be a cultural melting pot. No matter how far I travel, Hilltop will always feel like home. Walking its streets at night invigorates me, as I encounter people more likely to offer me a jacket than to threaten me. It's a community where laundromat owners stay open a bit longer so I can charge my phone when I have nowhere else to escape from the rain. It's a place where, on the gloomiest of nights, I've huddled against concrete storefronts, thinking I'm invisible, only to be acknowledged by someone who stops, hands me $5, and assures me of my worth and beauty.",
            "I moved to this area just before starting eighth grade, and initially, making friends was a challenge. Eventually, I connected with a neighbor two houses down and another person on my street. Although they have since moved away, the memories remain. Most of the original residents are still here. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On warm weekends, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, the area is quiet throughout the week. I've never had any issues with anyone here; people respect your privacy unless assistance is needed. I've ordered many packages online and never had one stolen from my porch, which makes me trust my neighbors. There's a park just a short walk from my home where I've made numerous memories. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with other neighborhood kids. I also have a not-so-great memory of getting elbowed in the nose during a football game, but the positive experiences outweigh the negatives. Nowadays, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who are much younger and enjoy the swings and slides. They get excited just thinking about the park. It brings back a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is diverse, with a variety of food options nearby. Within a mile, you can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. Many people now use apps like GrubHub and DoorDash for food delivery. Fast food places are popular and common in suburban areas, along with numerous pizza joints. The local stores offer everything you might need, including several dry cleaners. There's a Walgreens and CVS on the same street, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores reflect the area's diversity, like an Indian-owned shop for those interested in homemade or ready-made Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Seeing stories on social media and the news about others' challenging experiences with their neighbors makes me thankful for mine.",
            "I find living in my neighborhood enjoyable since it's conveniently close to the college I attend. The area mainly consists of apartment buildings, but there are also a few restaurants and bars that are enjoyable and reasonably priced. Recently, one of the bars underwent a name change and, although it's a bit pricier, the service and drinks are decent. The people around are generally pleasant, mostly college students or individuals with lower incomes, as the housing here is relatively affordable. There are many children in the vicinity because of an elementary school within walking distance from my apartment. Though I don't know my neighbors and have no desire to, I find it amusing that the building management installed an air freshener unit opposite their door due to their frequent marijuana use. The buildings in my area mostly have an old appearance, though some may have updated interiors. A little further down the street, there are newly constructed apartments, but I dislike them as they were poorly built, despite the high rent, which seems like a rip-off. Being near the campus allows the management to charge more. There's a very inexpensive restaurant about five minutes away that serves food on paper plates and mostly uses microwaves for cooking. Opposite that is a gas station, reportedly not a great place to work. Thanks to city funding, the road was renovated last summer, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, which improved the area's appearance. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, although a few were cut down, leaving stumps, but the greenery is more abundant here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a line of trees and another apartment complex. I live on 42nd Street, with 43rd Street right behind, which isn't as nice. The sidewalks are in disrepair, and the buildings appear rundown. There are many trees on this street, likely to obscure the buildings’ condition. Crime is prevalent in an apartment complex on that street, but it's not confined there, as the apartments across from me also experience significant crime and have a transient population. Despite this, I appreciate my living situation. It's affordable, and the proximity to useful amenities is convenient. I particularly value the short walk to the university and the two bus stops that make trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "My neighborhood is nestled in a cul-de-sac filled with duplexes. These homes are arranged in a way that gives the impression of individual houses, despite the fact they're all painted yellow, with white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly with one another, although not everyone is. In the evenings, we often gather at the end of one of our driveways, chatting while the neighborhood children play with their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It's a refreshing break from the modern, technology-driven world, almost like stepping back in time. We're surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy white clouds above. The downside? This season has brought tornado warnings, and just last night, for the first time, we heard the tornado sirens, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself clinging to my smallest dog in the bathtub, along with my purse and some pillows. My larger dog refused to join us, staying in the living room, barking nervously at the strange situation. The neighborhood fell silent, save for the clatter of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the rapid temperature drop—from 92 to 75 degrees in mere minutes. The hail melted instantly upon contact with the hot pavement. As the skies began to clear, the sun emerged, and a double rainbow appeared. I dashed inside to grab my camera and quickly snapped photos to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for another hour until residents returned after the thunderstorm. Then, the usual evening scene resumed, with moms and children outdoors while dinners cooked. It's such a friendly neighborhood for someone like me, who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I adore the local southern accents. My apartment, like everyone else's, has two bedrooms and two baths, but while the houses look identical from the outside, the apartments inside can vary greatly, with some being surprisingly small. I enjoy strolling along the expansive field behind my home, eventually reaching a pond that's not meant for swimming. I've spotted deer, and in the mornings, you can hear the resonant song of a bullfrog. It's a fantastic place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte. Each morning begins with the sound of roosters crowing from nearby farms. It's like living in a quaint village community. There's even a donkey at a nearby farm whose braying can be heard in the evening, reminding us of his presence. Discovering this gem of a neighborhood has been a stroke of luck.",
            "Having lived here for nearly a decade, I feel I can share some of my experiences. Initially, when I moved from Riverdale to Stockbridge, I was quite upset. I missed my old friends and community, and I cried over leaving them behind. However, my parents wanted a better environment for my sister and me, so we relocated to a place with improved housing and schools that were considered more desirable. Over time, I adapted, made new friends—and a few adversaries—at school. I didn’t connect deeply with many of my neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his family, as well as Dennis, who lived next door. They became like a second family to me, and I genuinely value them. I recall attending Mr. Glen's wedding when he remarried. It was a joyous occasion, and I even caught the garter, though I missed the bouquet! We celebrated all night, and I had a great time with Marsharii, one of his daughters, whom I haven't seen since. I hope she’s doing well. The neighborhood can be confusing, but with a GPS, I’ve explored more, especially with friends like Kason and Curtis. We spent countless hours playing video games and savoring life. Sometimes, I find solace in nature at the park, where I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot or wield my bokken, a wooden sword. There are also basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a while. Tennis, in particular, holds fond memories of my dad and Mr. Graves teaching my friend and me. Despite the challenges, we always had fun. There are many cherished memories here, and I believe the future holds even more exciting moments.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina is my charming hometown, a place that might seem ordinary at first glance but holds a notable position in agriculture. Johnston proudly claims the title of the Peach Capital of the World, a fact celebrated on its town sign. The landscape is primarily agricultural, with expanses of peach orchards and cattle farms. Residences outside the town center are often two-story structures, equipped with either metal roofs for summer heat relief or gray shingles, and are set back from the road to accommodate front fields for crops or livestock. \n\nIn the heart of town, a solitary traffic light signals the presence of the community's limited commercial area. Here, one can find three fast-food options: Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery; Fiesta Mexican Restaurant; and Gary's, a modest burger joint. Sadly, the local pizzeria recently shuttered its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is humorously renowned for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, is the sole grocery store, though locals often venture to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for larger shopping trips. Dollar General stands as the town's most frequented shop, offering a broad range of everyday items and bustling with activity from opening to closing. \n\nPossibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store helmed by a well-regarded local woman, has served the community for many years, even employing movers for furniture delivery. Connected to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering daycare, boarding, and various grooming options. The town's medical needs are met by a small doctor's office and a veterinary practice, both slightly removed from the central area but well-equipped. Johnston Elementary School serves the town's younger students, who then continue their education in the neighboring town for middle and high school. \n\nWhile Johnston lacks parks, a new 2.5-acre recreational area is underway to provide more family-friendly spaces and attract visitors. The town offers limited entertainment options; there are no cinemas, bowling alleys, social spots, playgrounds, pet walking areas, or diverse dining choices. Nevertheless, Johnston's charm lies in its smallness, a place so quaint you might miss it if you blink.",
            "I reside in a conventional suburban setting in a quaint town in southern Tennessee. Our street connects two major highways, which brings a bit more traffic than I’d prefer, but otherwise, it’s a peaceful community. Not many residents come and go, so I'm quite familiar with the majority of the neighbors. People tend to engage in activities like yard work and other routine tasks. During winter, we take to sledding on a hill along our side street. Our house is located prominently at the street's front corner, giving us a clear view of the daily comings and goings, and we tend to recognize the cars people in the area drive. If an unfamiliar vehicle appears, we usually notice it. Some neighbors enjoy walking for exercise or taking their dogs for a stroll. Children riding bicycles and similar activities are common sights as well. Since we work from home, we spend a lot of time at the house. Our family consists of four members: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, who are eleven and fourteen years old. This means the neighborhood is quite accustomed to seeing us around. We frequently enjoy outdoor activities, sometimes even when it’s raining. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the delightful aroma of grilled food. The sound of lawn mowers is a daily occurrence from March until October, as the grass grows vigorously. The neighborhood, once a woodland area, is filled with trees, providing ample shade and an abundance of leaves during Fall. This results in an annual tradition of raking and burning leaves, a task I enjoy due to the pleasant scent of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of Fall. Recently, our winters have been mild, almost blending into an extended fall season. Our garage is located at the rear of our house, making the front door rarely used unless we have visitors, which is infrequent. I enjoy working on my truck and other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays tend to be quiet, though Thanksgiving brings visiting families and extra cars parked along the streets. Similar patterns occur on other holidays like Mother’s Day and Christmas. All things considered, I enjoy living here. If the street weren’t a thoroughfare, it would be ideal.",
            "Nestled in the heart of the high desert, my neighborhood is surrounded by endless stretches of dirt. It's a unique environment that only those who have lived here can truly comprehend—the constant sight of brown all around. If you spot a green lawn, you know the owner is investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, houses were widely scattered. Although there have been numerous new developments, the area maintains its spacious feel. It's beginning to resemble a city more with each passing day, but I suppose this transformation is common everywhere. Generally, the community is quite friendly, though like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood, inhabited by amiable older folks, is probably one of the nicer areas. The local shopping scene is dominated by chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final, and for more upscale options, one has to venture out further as Whole Foods and similar stores are absent. The most common job sector here, at least from my perspective, is construction. This is likely because the city is still developing, with plenty of open land available for building. The thought of further development is somewhat daunting to me; I appreciate things as they are now, having left a big city and not wanting to return to that lifestyle. My full-time job is in construction as well—I work as a drywall and T-bar installer. One aspect I cherish about living here is the diverse wildlife. Many people are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty. The unique climate and landscape have fostered ecosystems that require protection and support a variety of wildlife. It's crucial for those living here to understand and coexist peacefully with these natural inhabitants. My family and I have adapted well, and my three children are particularly fascinated by lizards and bugs; as I write this, they’re outside trying to catch some. In terms of attractions, there are a few. Victorville offers a family-friendly desert experience, particularly if you can time your visit with the San Bernardino County Fair—an event that offers a delightful mix of activities. Nearby Wrightwood boasts snow-covered mountains and opportunities for winter sports. For those interested in the high desert's natural history and culture, the Victor Valley Museum is a treasure trove of geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the story of Victorville's societal and industrial growth.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response might be a bit different from the usual. While many people define their neighborhood in terms of the homes they own and their individual lifestyles, my situation stands out. For me, my neighborhood is the college campus where I reside, and the community consists of the people living in my dormitory. I also view the surrounding campus as part of my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser degree. Despite this unusual perspective, my neighborhood does share similarities with the more traditional notion of a neighborhood. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine includes housing, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by discussing the types of \"houses\" found in my neighborhood. To clarify, there are three main kinds of housing here: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory residences. In the apartments, each room usually accommodates 2-4 people, with about 4-6 rooms per floor. These buildings generally have two floors, resulting in approximately 20 residents per building. Then there are actual houses, available for rent to those affiliated with the school, often housing alumni. These are typically 2-4 bedroom houses, though they are fewer in number and less common. Lastly, there are the typical dormitory rooms, housing hundreds of students. These dorms usually have two people per room, with some exceptions, and are the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. With housing covered, let's talk about the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, which is mirrored in the composition of my neighborhood. It hosts individuals from various cultures and age groups. Most professional staff reside in the neighborhood's houses, while newer students occupy dorm-style housing and older students tend to live in apartment-style accommodations. It's hard to fully capture the essence of the people in this neighborhood with mere words, so let's move on to the stores and parks. As a self-contained community, my school has an array of stores and a single park. The shops include a variety of dining options, akin to those found in any neighborhood, as well as the school's unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. Thus, everything one might need is available within the boundaries of my neighborhood! Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the community's diverse members, maintained clean and safe by everyone in the neighborhood.",
            "In the area where I reside, sidewalks are a rarity. The landscape tends to slope downward, and my house is perched at the top of the neighborhood's most pronounced hill. Locals have dubbed it the \"work out hill\" because numerous joggers favor it for their daily exercise. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians often take to the road. The road itself is somewhat perilous, marked by potholes in several spots. The telephone and electric wires encircling the block appear rather worn. Frequent rainstorms in the region lead to branches and debris falling on the power lines, resulting in a patched and mismatched appearance due to constant repairs. Tall evergreen trees are abundant in every direction. However, the community tends to dislike them, striving to remove as many as possible since they block views of the ocean. Consequently, numerous houses are constructed high up on the hill, featuring expansive glass-fronted second stories, all designed to capture the bay view. The sight is breathtaking at sunset when the water seems illuminated from beneath and the sky glows orange. Yet, it's more often cloudy, with sunlight filtering through a haze. Most days feel damp and overcast. Moss proliferates on any available surface: roofs, cars, and railings. Once, I left my car in the driveway for a month, and by the time I returned to it, it was cloaked in a green, mossy layer. It took me three hours to scrape it all away. There aren't many children in my vicinity, even though a school is just a few blocks away. The neighborhood primarily consists of older residents, many of whom are retired. Instead of children, there are numerous dogs. It's typical to see them lounging on lawns or darting down the street. Leaving a door or window open might result in an unexpected canine visitor inside your home. I once found a dog in my living room and had to escort it back out. Wild rabbits populate the area, and some are quite large, much to the dismay of gardeners who find them digging up plant roots and burrowing into lawns. My cats, however, are fond of them and have managed to drive most of them away from our neighborhood. We also see the usual variety of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, with the occasional hawk or eagle making an appearance until the neighborhood crows chase them off. There are no stores nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront reveals a few restaurants offering fresh seafood. The beach is minimal, but the rocks along the shore are perfect for skipping into the water. The bay is relatively narrow; the opposite shore is visible even through the mist on most days.",
            "When planning a visit to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, you'll find it quite easy to get there. New York City's public transportation system is highly convenient and widely used. As an urban area, Bensonhurst offers that quintessential New York City vibe. You'll notice a significant presence of Asian businesses throughout the area, as the neighborhood has seen an increase in Asian residents over the past 20 years. Consequently, Asian-owned stores, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are common sights, often appearing on every block. These businesses are popular among locals due to their excellent quality, competitive pricing, and overall convenience. For example, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk of each other near my location, making grocery shopping exceptionally easy. However, Bensonhurst isn't exclusively Asian-populated; it's a diverse neighborhood with a mix of immigrants and first- and second-generation Americans. While many of the prominent local businesses are Asian-owned, the community also boasts a newly renovated park featuring approximately ten basketball courts, a spacious field suitable for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground, and a water fountain for summer fun. The parks, like the city itself, are melting pots of diversity, where people from different backgrounds come together harmoniously. The area isn't dominated by towering corporate buildings; instead, you'll find co-op residences, condominiums, and primarily two-family houses. The residents tend to be friendly, albeit quite loud. Expect to hear cars with loud music or revving engines early in the morning. While the neighborhood is generally safe, it's wise to stay alert at night since unpredictable situations can arise. In the past, I've faced bullying and, more recently, package theft has been an issue. Despite fines for not picking up after dogs, many don't adhere to the rules here, so it's common to encounter dog waste on the sidewalks. This is a particular annoyance of mine, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "When you think of Portland, Oregon, it's essential to grasp what \"weird\" truly signifies. The city's unofficial motto, emblazoned on a building that functions as a pizza place, bar, music hall, and strip club—while bending the rules in at least half of these roles—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nod to the Portland of the 1990s and early 2000s, a time when the city was less renowned and more affordable, fostering unique and creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where being labeled \"weird\" is a compliment. Even with the influx of wealthy Californians and the constant rise of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its quirky essence. \"Weird\" here doesn't always equate to acceptance, but it does mean embracing what typically isn't accepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern conveniences or battles, as we, like the rest of the nation, source most of our goods from China. While there are countless expressions of weirdness, Portland also has its share of normalcy. The city is home to yoga enthusiasts, hipsters, and business professionals alike. Perhaps being weird simply means not taking life too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others across Portland, we boast vibrant houses, gardens filled with flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes during summer. These free boxes, traditionally cardboard but sometimes plastic, are filled with items someone no longer needs. Remarkably often, they hold a hidden gem just right for a passerby. Typically containing clothes and books, they can include anything. The magic of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood encapsulates what the city represents to me, though I am just one type of weird among many. Some residents would never consider picking up clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga, where participants practice yoga with live goats, or cheer at Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a haven for people with diverse passions. It's a place where we chase our dreams, or at least dream of chasing them while spending too much time in bars. Indeed, Portland struggles with drug issues, which often stem from mental health challenges compounded by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. The city also faces homelessness, a problem without a clear solution. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively robust social services, though these are still inadequate, as elsewhere in the country. The non-homeless community oscillates between compassion and disdain. In this respect, we are not unique at all.",
            "The mountains stand constant in the distance, particularly to the north where they observe the sun’s daily rise and fall. Even when life’s busyness engulfs me and I momentarily overlook them, they remain steadfast, indifferent to life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they seem to demand my attention, and when I finally acknowledge them, they offer a quiet solace, helping me gather the strength to press on. I first arrived here as a college freshman, and it was those northern peaks that captured my heart. Certainly, the university itself boasts impressive architecture and picturesque spots such as buildings, ponds, and trees that I hold dear, but it is the mountains that reign supreme in my affections. This town, too, possesses its own charm. Numerous cafés have been my refuge for caffeine-fueled study sessions. A short walk or bus ride to the downtown area reveals a historic charm through its faded brick façades lining the streets with restaurants and office spaces. Here, the town displays a vibrancy akin to its neighboring city. However, this lively atmosphere quickly shifts as one can retreat back to the tranquil small-town feel, simply by passing the library. The juxtaposition of these distinct environments in such close proximity gives the city an enchanting allure that invites exploration. This setting fosters countless treasured memories linked to various parts of town, from late-night strolls by the old swings with friends after pulling an all-nighter, to mad dashes through the bustling downtown to catch a university-sponsored movie at the grand theater. Yet, as with any place in life, it holds its share of painful memories. The ponds, especially, serve as poignant spots for contemplation and the occasional late-night emotional release. I’ve spent many a moment there, pondering life's mysteries while observing the turtles, ducks, and insects playing their roles in nature, which in turn prompted reflections on my own purpose. Wandering past the pond, the park, and the suburban streets, I eventually reached a main road. It was then that the sun illuminated the palm trees, painting a vibrant sky. Looking up at the dawn, I realized my path had led me northward. There they were, as always, the imposing mountains rising above the blue and yellow horizon, silently reinforcing my resilience.",
            "At first sight, you might overlook it—tucked away behind a row of shops lies a residential area you wouldn't expect to find. It’s not exactly a spot where people typically choose to settle down. Yet, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods and meander behind the hotels that fill up only sporadically, mainly during summer family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. Along these streets, a series of apartment buildings stand, meticulously arranged like Russian nesting dolls, each carefully positioned beside the next, lining the road. The initial apartments you encounter have made headlines for some questionable activities, so let’s not dwell on those too much—looks can be misleading, after all. However, the complexes adjacent to them reveal a hidden world few locals know about. Across the street from these complexes is a quiet satellite campus of a community college. Here, students shuffle in, clutching their morning coffee and stifling yawns as they start their day at 7 am. The gates creak open to let them in one by one, while commuters express their impatience by honking and gesturing when traffic slows on busy days. This road meets another residential street at a T-junction, flanked by a park on one side and a rehab center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries on the other. The center features inviting porch chairs and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Meanwhile, children frolic in the park, turning cartwheels on the grass as bees buzz among the roadside flowers. Retirees walk their dogs, frowning at skateboarders and nodding politely to teenage girls sharing gossip at the playground. Nearby, a strip mall houses a sushi restaurant known for its affordable offerings, yet it remains oddly quiet. Next door, a swim supply shop and a nail salon provide convenient services. There, you can prepare your pool for the season while enjoying a manicure and savoring hibachi chicken—all within the strip mall’s confines. A DIY frozen yogurt shop is also part of this mix, where teens from the park often gather, holding cups of yogurt topped with various treats as they attempt tricks on skateboards or vape, considering it the height of coolness. This neighborhood represents a quintessential slice of Americana—a snapshot of history in the tranquil South, where change is slow and time seems to stand still.",
            "The neighborhood I live in has a charm of its own. Many of the homes are designed for single families, though a handful have been cleverly divided into dual residences, yet remain connected in structure. My own house features a modest garden at the front and a small driveway on its left side. Like most homes here, it evokes memories of a past era when suburban life epitomized the American dream. This dream once seemed welcoming to the nation, but now feels as if it's drifting away. However, my neighborhood, like many others, persists in reminding us and our visitors that the dream endures, and we cling to it as best as we can. People don't seem as cheerful as before; the neatness of the small gardens has faded somewhat, yet cars still populate the driveways, and children continue to play as if their surroundings were their entire world. The local public school, standing for nearly 90 years, still fosters aspirations in the younger generation while invoking nostalgia among older residents. The churches are sparse and largely unoccupied, but the basketball courts remain lively. Each house appears different yet carries a similar essence. There's a large supermarket called Super \"A,\" owned by a big Yemeni family, seemingly the only Arab family in the area. The majority of residents are African American. The streets are broad, and children often play football, pausing only when cars need to pass. Most residents have lived here for generations, often sharing tales of a time when everyone was acquainted. There used to be a karate school, but as the popularity of karate-themed movies waned, so did the desire to emulate them, leading to its conversion into a pharmacy, since, as they say, medicine solves many problems. Also in the area is a small cinema that screens classic films at reduced rates, attracting the older crowd who appreciate an affordable evening out, sans children, despite its lack of new releases which dissuades the youth. A single expressway runs through my town, though its entrances and exits are located in the neighboring town. A petition once sought an exit for our town; the younger residents favored it, but the elders opposed it, believing it would disrupt the town's character, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the proposal. A new high school is under construction, and a mascot is being chosen for the town. I think a cyborg with a Southern accent and a log cabin would perfectly symbolize our community.",
            "Living in a bustling city, my neighborhood stands out for its remarkable diversity. Residential zones are interspersed, almost haphazardly, among commercial districts filled with a wide array of businesses. These establishments range from office buildings to shops, dining venues, and entertainment spots. There's no end to the new eateries to try or shops to explore. While some stores are large, well-recognized brands owned by major corporations, the appeal of small boutiques is growing. These boutiques aren't just found in malls; they also line the streets, often within walking distance of neighborhoods that might be tranquil if not for the numerous attractions nearby. Additionally, a couple of parks are close, where families often visit with their young children. \n\nThe neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity. Within a small area, there's a strong LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish presence, and groups of immigrants and refugees from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate surroundings, the city's diversity broadens even more, with people of various races and backgrounds often establishing their own small communities. For instance, Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia are just a few miles away. However, those few miles can translate into a lengthy drive, especially with the traffic, which can turn a 10-mile journey into a two-hour ordeal during peak times. Despite the proximity of some attractions, few residents choose to walk, given the city's vastness. Consequently, the traffic is notoriously bad, and finding parking is a challenge. \n\nIronically, amidst all this, the city has seen a surge in construction, with large apartment buildings springing up. It seems to be a preferred location, yet current residents often feel disheartened by the thought of more people and cars. Housing in my city is varied. Not everyone desires to live in a towering apartment complex. The residential areas consist of houses of different sizes and smaller apartments and condos. There are single-family homes and duplexes, even within my local area, providing a range of housing options. The neighborhood's residents also vary in age, and I must admit, I don’t know most of my neighbors. It lacks the close-knit feel it once had, though I have fond childhood memories of playing outside with my next-door neighbor and a few neighborhood friends who were my age.",
            "\"Where is everything?\" she inquired as we cruised by the seemingly endless corn fields stretching to the horizon. \"This is it!\" I replied, aware she'd be surprised by the vast openness of the countryside. She was accustomed to a town where a quick five-minute stroll would take her to the grocery store—such expansive spaces were foreign to her. As she took in the continuous stretch of corn fields, I recounted my experiences of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she glimpsed into my world and origins. Traveling along a narrow, two-lane country road, you'll encounter a water-filled quarry. Just beyond lies the small community where I reside. The homes here are mainly crafted from brick and stucco, each occupying at least half an acre of land that their owners diligently care for. In spring, vibrant flowers bloom alongside the midwestern trees that transform with each season. Driveways showcase pristine, high-end Mercedes Benz vehicles, sparkling in the midday sun after a thorough car wash. On the way to my grey stucco residence, my Korean neighbor often greets with a warm smile. He dedicates much of his day to lawn care, his singing harmonizing with the mower's drone. He’s a source of amusement in the neighborhood but is genuinely kind and has a fascinating past. With age, he’s lost some of his sharpness. A former doctor, he often blends into the green expanse with his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, you arrive at my home. The side yard is frequented by geese, persistently chased by our Terrier. Behind the house, a small stream flows into the quarry, echoing with bullfrogs' calls and the occasional \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a rustic wooden bridge lies an untouched haven of naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This is where much of my childhood unfolded. From constructing tree forts to 'hunting' animals (primarily chasing them), there was an abundance of activities and usually a neighborhood friend to join in. Winters in my small town can be harshly cold, yet strikingly beautiful. The yard shifts from lush green to a stark wilderness. The once flower-laden trees become bare, skeletal structures. An infrequent snowfall conjures an overnight winter wonderland. My sister leaves snow angels and builds snowmen in the backyard. We often bickered as children, and during winter, snowball fights were our battles of choice. We'd construct large, igloo-like shelters to store our snowballs, often using branches as our arsenal. In this magical little world, we played make-believe with no other concerns. We were simply carefree kids."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America, my home is in a quaint town in Michigan. It's a place where expansive farmlands transition seamlessly into charming tourist spots. Lacking the sprawling malls of a big city, there isn’t a Wal-Mart, Target, or Applebee’s in sight. Any destination requires a drive, yet I reside in one of the most stunning locales on the planet, embraced by water. My town is bordered by the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering beaches at every turn perfect for a quick dip. \n\nMy neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town life. The houses aren't crammed together or identical in design; instead, they have character, with some newly remodeled and others maintaining their vintage charm. Many of these homes feature full, visible basements, and a number display classic aluminum siding. The surrounding blocks burst with houses in every imaginable hue, each with its own yard. These yards host trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for pets. The homes speak to the spirit of Middle America, occupied by hardworking individuals, many of whom are nurturing families or have done so in the past.\n\nChildren can often be seen playing in the streets, while adults walk their dogs, bike, or rollerblade. The community is tightly knit, with neighbors recognizing each other and identifying newcomers. You might pass someone barbecuing or encounter a dog walker from a few streets away, exchanged with a friendly wave or smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with no remnants of autumn leaves, and grass kept neatly trimmed. Any plants or bushes are pruned to perfection. Although the neighborhood might not stun with opulence, it exudes a warm, familial appeal, suggesting it's an ideal place to raise a family. Its tranquility, safety, and peacefulness make it special. \n\nWithin a short walk, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, flanked by the Health Department. The city's recycling center is nearby, providing essential services to the community. Close to us are baseball and softball fields where the sounds of games echo, punctuated by announcers calling out player names. Adjacent to these fields is our modest town airport, where the hum of small planes is a familiar backdrop. A stroll can lead to the local ice cream shop, or even downtown for those who enjoy a longer walk. My children can easily bike to the park, just eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The place where I reside can best be summed up as a quintessential suburban area, replete with uniformity. The influence of a homeowner's association is evident in my neighborhood. As you enter, meticulously cared-for single-family homes line the streets, thanks to the oversight of the association. The front yards bear a striking resemblance to one another, each featuring a modest lawn, decorative stones, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot small trees. Every household boasts a two-car garage. While navigating through the neighborhood, you'll notice the roads are freshly paved and devoid of potholes, despite the diversity of families living here. Most homes are single-story, though two-story ones are also present. Unlike the typical single-family home setup, there aren't individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, like in apartment complexes, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, and residents use keys to access their specific boxes. Two larger lockers are available for parcels. Again, the HOA's penchant for uniformity is at play here. My house is situated on the outskirts of the city, blending suburban and rural elements. This location allows for ample space. There are several community pools, all well-kept and enclosed, available to residents. Additionally, there are numerous walking trails for dog walking or solitary evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood's size is sufficient for runs. The community predominantly consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where people look out for one another. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it has a surprisingly large population but retains a small-town vibe. Most amenities you'd expect are present, including a single mall that, while not massive, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to significant destinations, where I find a variety of stores. There are upscale grocery stores offering organic products and bargain outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to reduce costs. Overall, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and typical. It offers amenities such as pools and walking trails. Though not adjacent to shopping centers, a short drive provides access to major retail chains.",
            "The first time I came across my neighborhood, I was tuned into a podcast focusing on individuals who had disappeared. It caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment nearby was priced over a thousand dollars monthly. Neither my friends nor I had ever heard about that particular incident. Perhaps it's the challenge. Some of my friends find themselves crying at night. Life is costly, but we've become adept at living economically. Over time, you grow fond of the musty scent of flea market finds and clothes that have been stored away with mothballs. As adults, we seem to notice smells less. You might take up smoking or become desensitized to the general state of things. Yet, the flea market remains a constant presence. The aroma of adulthood is akin to dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It seeps into leather and lingers even after cleaning. Here, three thrift stores are conveniently nearby. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but inside the thrifts, it's quiet. No matter the hustle outside, the shops remain serene. It’s a perfect spot to while away an afternoon. Annually, more people and vehicles flood in. The city is evolving, as they say. Hosting one of the largest e-commerce and delivery giants, it still experiences growing pains. It reminds me of New York. People here are driven by their own ambitions, and there's little demand placed on you. You can enjoy solitude and independence without interference. Unlike the South, where concern often signifies care, here, privacy is respected. You can maintain your personal space as long as you wish, with the city rhythmically ebbing like waves on a shore. It’s a vibrant place to reside. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers above, there's always some activity. In many respects, we have less of a disconnected apartment building and more of a community. We support each other, celebrate milestones, and offer help when needed. In a sense, I’m fortunate to be here. I appreciate most of my neighbors, and they reciprocate with kindness. I make an effort to tidy up, share food, and they do likewise. We exchange mail deliveries. It’s good to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company just as I do theirs. Though I reside in an expansive, impersonal modern development, neighbors like mine make me feel I haven't completely lost my way.",
            "I reside in a quaint Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban fringe of a bustling city. My neighborhood, located on the town's eastern edge, is often regarded as the most economically challenged area here. The property market is quite modest, with most homes being either rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the neighborhood maintains a certain charm, and isn't unpleasant at all. My neighbors are mostly warm-hearted people who greet me with a smile when I stroll down the street. Although the crime rate here is a bit higher compared to other parts of the town, it remains relatively low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks of my home, including several shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors experienced a tragic loss when their son was shot outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has not been directly impacted by crime aside from the occasional disappearance of items left on our porch. The town I live in has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid crisis\" affecting many regions across the United States. Fentanyl overdoses have tragically claimed many lives. However, our town offers numerous resources to address this issue, including several addiction treatment centers and Narcan training sessions for the loved ones of those struggling with addiction. Despite these hurdles, the town possesses numerous positive qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an exceptional staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered any bullying, thanks to the school's incredibly supportive environment, which he absolutely adores. The PTO is highly active, organizing multiple events throughout the year to foster family engagement and educational development. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school-related costs, such as fees, supplies, and field trips, are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made numerous improvements to the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, most of these enhancements have been concentrated in the town center and the west side, where the shopping districts are located, and most traffic flows. The east side, where I reside, tends to be overlooked, which is a source of dissatisfaction for my neighborhood. All in all, I genuinely enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are ample shopping options, from small businesses to larger retail stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be highly valued, but it is comfortable and sufficient. We've been here for more than 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is vibrant with culture. Perched on a hill, it's enveloped by buildings rich with history. I reside in a seven-story apartment directly opposite an old theater, and just down the hill, there's an intriguing arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people eagerly waiting to get in. A few blocks in the other direction lies the nearest city park. It's quite spacious, considering its urban setting. The park is bordered by concrete, with high stairs built into the walls. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. While snow is rare, the heavy winter rains often make it challenging to stay warm. By clustering their tents in the center of town, rather than in more secluded areas, they manage to stay warmer. They're also conveniently near the only family center for miles, where they can access showers and bathing facilities. What I cherish most about my city isn't just the beauty of its historic architecture—the grand buildings and varied hilltop levels sloping towards the ocean. What truly captivates me is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories linger of federal agents and the DEA sweeping through the streets. The community remembers. Tales are passed down through generations, even reaching newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the residents strive to maintain and improve it. They care deeply about their community. There’s a common caution that white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning hearkens back to the past, carrying the bitter taste of social conditioning. Maybe it's because I can pass as someone who isn't entirely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-fueled assumptions that persist, even in a city celebrated as a cultural melting pot. One thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, encountering people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners have kept their doors open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere else to escape the rain. It's a place where I've huddled against storefronts on the dreariest of nights, only to have someone stop, meet my eyes, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I transitioned to this community just before beginning eighth grade. Initially, forging friendships was challenging, but eventually, I became close with a neighbor two doors away and another individual from my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories linger. Most of the original residents remain. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, characterized by numerous two-story residences. On weekends or warm days, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, it's a peaceful area during the week. I've never encountered issues with anyone here; people keep to themselves unless assistance is needed. I've ordered many packages without any being stolen from my porch, reinforcing my trust in my neighbors. A park is just a short walk from my home and holds many memories for me. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with local friends. Despite a painful incident where I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park now evokes a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is notably diverse, offering a variety of nearby dining options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisines within a mile. Many people now prefer using delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their meals. Fast food is prevalent, as expected in most suburban areas, along with numerous pizzerias. The local stores provide for all needs, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, common in the Midwest. There's also a diverse selection of stores, including an Indian-owned shop for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Stories of negative neighbor experiences shared on social media and the news make me grateful for the community I have.",
            "I reside in a neighborhood conveniently close to my college, which I find quite enjoyable. The area is primarily filled with apartment buildings, alongside a few restaurants and bars that offer entertainment without being too costly. One bar recently got a new name and is pricier, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The community is mostly friendly, with either college students or lower-income residents, as the apartments are relatively affordable. There's an elementary school nearby, so many children live in the area. I don't have much interaction with my neighbors and prefer it that way; they tend to smoke a lot, prompting building management to install an air freshener right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not a bit rude. The surrounding buildings often look aged from the outside, though some might have updated interiors. Further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because their construction was subpar, yet their rent is high—an unfortunate rip-off due to their proximity to campus. Nearby, there's a very inexpensive restaurant about a five-minute walk away that serves food on paper plates and relies heavily on microwaves. Across from it is a gas station, which reportedly isn't a great workplace. However, the city recently funded road improvements, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment building is nestled among trees, although a few have been removed, leaving stumps. More trees are around my place than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, located just behind, isn't as pleasant. Its sidewalks are deteriorating, and many buildings appear run-down. The trees on that street might be there to obscure the view of these buildings. My locality experiences most of its crime in an apartment complex on that street, though it's not the only source—there's also crime in the apartments across from me, which have a transient population. Nonetheless, I appreciate living here. It's affordable, with plenty of convenient amenities close by. The university's walking distance, and two bus stops make trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "In my neighborhood, duplexes line a cul-de-sac, with their placement giving the illusion of standalone homes. They're uniformly painted in yellow, accented by white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of driveways in the evening to chat while children play with toys, chalk, or kites. It feels like a step back in time amidst today's tech-driven world. The area is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds overhead. This season, however, we've had tornado warnings; last night, we heard the sirens and sought shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. Meanwhile, my larger dog stayed in the living room, anxious and barking. The storm left the area quiet except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. The temperature dropped rapidly from 92 to 75 degrees, and the hail melted quickly on the warm pavement. After the storm, the sun appeared, and as the skies cleared, a double rainbow emerged. I dashed inside to grab my camera and captured the moment to share with friends and family on Facebook, who were equally amazed. The streets remained silent for an hour until people returned home, resuming their usual activities with kids playing outside as dinner cooked. As someone new to the area, having moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I find the neighborhood welcoming and enjoy the southern accent. Each apartment has two bedrooms and two baths, but despite identical exteriors, the interiors vary in size. I love walking in the large field behind my home and wandering to the pond. I've seen deer, and in the morning, the calls of a bullfrog can be heard. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte, with mornings heralded by roosters from nearby farms. The sense of community is strong, akin to a village, with even a donkey at a nearby farm braying in the evenings. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having spent about a decade here, I feel ready to share my experiences. Initially, moving to this neighborhood was tough. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge brought tears, as I dearly missed my old friends. However, my parents aimed for a better life for my sister and me, offering improved housing and schooling, distinctly different from our previous 'ghetto' environment. Over time, I adapted, making new friends and, inevitably, some foes at school. Yet, I never really connected with many neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived close by. They have become like family to me, and I truly cherish them. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding when he remarried, a delightful occasion that inspires my own dreams of future happiness and prosperity. During the event, I caught the garter but missed the bouquet, and we danced the night away with Marsharii, one of his daughters, whom I haven’t seen since. I hope she’s doing well. \n\nThe neighborhood feels like a labyrinth, but with GPS, I can explore more. My adventures were often with Kason and Curtis, indulging in video games and reveling in life’s simple pleasures. Nature walks in the park bring a soothing peace, and I enjoy practicing balance with sticks from Home Depot or wielding my wooden bokken sword. Sports facilities like basketball and tennis courts are available, though I haven’t played recently. Tennis holds nostalgic memories, as my dad and Mr. Graves introduced me and my best friend to it, making those sessions both challenging and fun. Many fond memories have been created here, and I’m optimistic that even more wonderful experiences await.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming small town that might not seem extraordinary at first glance, yet it plays an important role in agriculture. Known as the Peach Capital of the World, Johnston proudly announces this claim on its welcoming sign. The landscape is largely agricultural, with vast stretches of land dedicated to peach orchards and cattle farming. Homes beyond the town center are generously spaced, mostly two-story structures featuring metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat, or covered with gray shingles. These residences are typically set back from the main roads, leaving ample space at the front for fields or livestock.\n\nThe heart of the town is marked by a solitary traffic light at a crossroads, where the town's few shops are found. If you’re in the mood for quick bites, you have limited choices: Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger joint. The town used to have a pizzeria, but it recently closed down. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy, is particularly famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The local grocery option is a small but pricey Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, where people often stop for just a few items, preferring to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping.\n\nDollar General holds the title of the busiest store in Johnston, offering a wide range of daily necessities and staying bustling from opening to closing. A small furniture store named Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a beloved community member, has long been a fixture in town, even offering delivery services with the help of two movers. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that also offers daycare, boarding, and various grooming services. Both the medical and veterinary practices are modestly sized but fully equipped to meet the needs of Johnston's residents, located a bit outside the main town area.\n\nChildren attend the single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, before moving on to middle and high school in a nearby town. While the town lacks any formal parks, plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract newcomers. Though there aren't entertainment venues like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, Johnston is a delightful town, small enough to miss if you're not paying attention as you pass through.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area located in a small town in southern Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, leading to a bit more traffic than I would prefer, yet the neighborhood remains generally peaceful. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents here. People mainly occupy themselves with tending to their yards and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on a side street nearby. Our house is situated at the front corner of the street, providing us with a view of everyone passing by, making us quite familiar with the vehicles commonly seen around here. When an unfamiliar car appears, we usually take notice. Some neighbors can be seen walking for exercise or taking their dogs for strolls. Children often ride their bikes, engaging in typical neighborhood activities. Since we work from home, my family and I—consisting of my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and myself—spend a considerable amount of time at home, and others are accustomed to seeing us come and go. We enjoy playing outside, sometimes even when it rains, and occasionally barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the delightful aroma of grilled food. Around here, the sound of lawn mowers is nearly constant from March until October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood, originally a wooded area, is rich with trees providing ample shade and an abundance of leaves during fall. This means annual leaf raking and burning, a scent I find pleasing as it signals the arrival of autumn. Recently, our winters have been mild, almost like an extended fall. Our garage is located at the back of the house, so the front door is rarely used unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays tend to be quiet, although Thanksgiving and other occasions like Mother's Day and Christmas bring visitors, resulting in extra cars around. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood situated right in the heart of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by endless stretches of dirt. It's hard for someone who hasn't lived here to grasp what it's like to constantly see shades of brown. Whenever you spot a green lawn, it's a clear sign that the homeowner is investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were few and far between. Although new development has occurred, that aspect hasn't changed much. The area is gradually taking on a more urban appearance, much like other places these days. Generally, the residents are quite welcoming, though, as with any urban area, there are both pleasant and less desirable sections. My neighborhood is filled with amiable elderly folks, making it quite a nice place to live. The local retail scene mostly consists of chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For more upscale shopping, you have to venture further; stores like Whole Foods are nowhere to be found here. Construction seems to be a significant industry in my city, likely because there's still plenty of undeveloped land available for building. This expansion worries me because I appreciate the current state of things. I left a bustling city and am not eager to return to that lifestyle. I'm employed in the construction sector myself, working as a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the aspects I enjoy most about living here is the diverse wildlife. People are drawn to the high desert for its striking beauty. The climate and landscape have produced unique ecosystems that need protection and are home to various creatures. It's important for the human inhabitants to understand and respect these animals to live in harmony. My family has adjusted well to the local wildlife. I have three children who are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, there are a few worth mentioning. Victorville is an excellent destination for families to explore the desert, offering a unique experience. If you visit, try to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair, which provides an enjoyable mix of activities. Nearby Wrightwood is perfect for seeing snow-covered mountains and taking winter sports lessons. Those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert should visit the Victor Valley Museum, which houses geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and items that showcase the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When I think about my neighborhood, my perspective might be a little different from the norm. Unlike many others who might think of a traditional neighborhood with homeowners leading separate lives, my situation is quite distinct. My concept of a neighborhood revolves around the college campus where I reside, with the dormitory residents as my community. I also consider the wider campus area to be part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite the uniqueness of my setting, my neighborhood shares several features with conventional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes residences, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by looking at the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. To begin, it's important to clarify the types of housing found here. There are three main housing types: apartments, standalone houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, you'll typically find 2-4 individuals per room, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have around two floors, housing approximately 20 people each. Then, there are the standalone houses available for school-affiliated individuals to rent, usually offering 2-4 bedrooms and often inhabited by alumni. These houses are less common due to their inefficiency. Lastly, the dormitories accommodate hundreds of students, generally with two people to a room, making them the most prevalent housing option. With housing described, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the neighborhood's demographic mix. Individuals from many cultures and age groups live here. Professional staff tend to reside in the standalone houses, newer students in the dormitories, and older students in apartment-style housing. Words alone can't fully capture the essence of the people here, so I'll shift focus to the stores and parks. My school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, offering a variety of stores and a single park. Stores range from dining options that resemble those in any neighborhood to the school's own brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Essentially, anything needed can be found within the neighborhood's limits. Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for the neighborhood's diverse population, maintained clean and safe by the community members.",
            "In my area, sidewalks are a rarity. The terrain slopes sharply, with my home perched atop the neighborhood's steepest incline. Locals often refer to it as the \"workout hill,\" favored by joggers for their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians share the road with vehicles. The pavement has its fair share of potholes, making driving somewhat precarious. Telephone and electric lines crisscross the area, appearing worn and patched due to frequent storms that bring down branches and other debris, necessitating constant repairs. Tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape, but they are unpopular with residents who prefer unobstructed ocean views. This desire leads to homes being constructed high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted upper floors to capture the bay's scenery. Sunsets here are stunning, as the water glows beneath an orange sky. However, clouds often obscure the sun, casting a hazy light over the area. Overcast, damp days are common, fostering moss growth on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, requiring hours of cleaning. Children are scarce in my neighborhood, even though a school is nearby. The community largely consists of older, retired individuals who favor dogs over kids. It's not unusual to see dogs lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street, and an open door might invite an unexpected canine visitor inside. Rabbits roam freely, much to the annoyance of gardeners who find their plants uprooted. My cats, however, have managed to reduce their numbers significantly. Birdwatchers can spot sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, though crows often drive them away. There are no shops nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The beach is limited, but the rocky shore provides ample entertainment for those who enjoy tossing stones into the bay. The bay is narrow enough to see the opposite shore clearly, mist permitting.",
            "If you're considering a trip to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, navigating there won't be much of a hassle. The area is well-served by public transit, which is a favored mode of getting around in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, maintaining that quintessential New York City vibe. During your exploration, you'll notice a significant presence of Asian-owned stores, a result of the substantial Asian community that has settled here over the last twenty years. These shops, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are quite prevalent and popular among locals due to their excellent quality, lower prices, and convenience. Close to my location, for instance, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk from one another, making grocery shopping extremely convenient. However, it's important to note that Bensonhurst isn't solely comprised of Asian residents; it's quite a melting pot, with immigrants and their children from various backgrounds. Many of the prominent businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these establishments, there's also a recently updated park nearby featuring multiple basketball courts, a sizable field for soccer or baseball, several handball courts, swings, a playground, and a refreshing water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. As you'd expect in New York City, the parks here are vibrant and diverse. People from all walks of life come together to interact and enjoy the facilities. The neighborhood doesn't have many towering corporate buildings; instead, it mostly consists of co-op or condo apartments and primarily two-family houses. The community is generally friendly, albeit a bit on the noisy side. It's common to hear cars with loud music or revving engines passing by, which can be quite the morning wake-up call. If you plan to visit at night, it's wise to stay alert. Although the area is relatively safe, unpredictability is a factor, with occasional troublemakers or petty thieves about. In fact, I've experienced bullying in the past, and package theft has been an issue recently. Despite fines for not picking up after dogs, some residents don't adhere to this rule, resulting in dog waste being a frequent sight on your morning walk to the train or supermarket. It's a personal annoyance of mine, so do watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To grasp what Portland, Oregon is truly about, one must first understand its unique interpretation of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, emblazoned on a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—often pushing legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was lesser-known, more affordable, fostering creative subcultures. For others, it’s an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant rise of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weirdness here doesn't necessarily mean acceptance of everything, but rather a tolerance for what is typically unaccepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or issues, either. Like the rest of America, we import most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to defy normalcy, yet Portland has its fair share of the ordinary—yoga, hipsters, and business professionals abound. Perhaps weirdness means taking all of this with a grain of salt. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland areas, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summer. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items people no longer need, yet often seem to contain a little magic—a perfect treasure for the passerby. Often filled with clothes and books, they can surprise with anything. The enchanting possibility of stumbling upon something special while wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood encapsulates the essence of Portland for me. But I represent just one version of weird among countless others. Some locals wouldn't dream of picking their clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or cheer at Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a city brimming with people chasing diverse passions. It's a place where some of us pursue our dreams, while others dream of pursuing them over a drink at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug issue, which often ties back to mental health struggles, exacerbated by the persistent rain and grey skies. The city also grapples with homelessness, a challenge without clear solutions. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively better social services, though still insufficient. The non-homeless residents oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this regard, perhaps we aren't so weird after all.",
            "The mountains stand silently, ever-present. To the north, they watch the sun rise and set every day. Regardless of how often I overlook them or become absorbed in the busyness of life, they remain steadfast, indifferent to life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they seem to call out, offering solace and strength when I take a moment to acknowledge them. I first encountered these mountains when I came here for my undergraduate studies, and they immediately caught my attention. While the university itself boasts impressive architecture, tranquil ponds, and lush trees that I hold dear, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is charming, with numerous cafés that have seen countless hours of intense study sessions. A short trip downtown reveals a blend of historic charm, with weathered bricks lining restaurants and offices, creating a vibrant atmosphere reminiscent of a bustling city. But this lively vibe only stretches so far before one can retreat to the peacefulness of the quieter parts of town, such as near the library. This close-knit mix of different atmospheres gives the city a magical feel, inviting exploration. It's easy to form treasured memories here, each tied to a specific spot. Whether it's strolling by the old swings in the park after a long night with friends or rushing through downtown to catch a university-sponsored movie at the theater, this place holds both joyful and difficult memories. The ponds, in particular, offer a space for reflection or emotional release during life’s chaotic moments. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives prompted me to ponder my own purpose as I navigated life's uncertainties. Walking past the pond, through the park, and by suburban homes, I eventually reached a main road. At that moment, the sun’s rays lit up the palm trees and painted the sky, revealing that I was heading north. Sure enough, the mountains were there, as always. Their towering presence against the hazy blue and yellow sky was more prominent than any building, and they quietly inspired a renewed sense of resilience within me.",
            "At first look, you might not give it much thought. It's tucked away behind a commercial strip, an unexpected spot for a residential area. One wouldn't typically associate it with desirable living spaces. However, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods, winding your way beyond the rarely filled hotels that see life only during family reunions each summer, you'll stumble upon a lively neighborhood. On these streets, a series of apartment complexes stand side by side, meticulously arranged like a set of Russian nesting dolls, each carefully separated and aligned along the road. The first set of apartments has gained some notoriety in the news for questionable activities, so let's not dwell on them much—appearances can be misleading, after all. But the neighboring complexes, along with the two adjacent ones, hold a different story that remains largely unknown to local residents. Across from these apartments lies a community college's satellite campus, a tranquil collection of buildings that seem to watch over the road. Students trickle in, coffee in hand, yawning as they begin their early morning classes. The old iron gates creak as they open to let them in, while drivers grumble impatiently at the increased traffic on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehab center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. The rehab facility has inviting porch furniture and a slow-moving ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids dash across the grass in the park, tumbling and spinning among the green blades, while bees lazily buzz around the flowerbeds lining the road. Retired folks walk their dogs on the paths, frowning at skateboarding teens and politely acknowledging teenage girls gathered near the playground, chatting about boys and the latest YouTube trends. Nearby, a strip mall hosts a sushi restaurant that serves affordable meals but never seems crowded. Next to it is a swim supply shop and a nail salon nestled between them. It's possible to prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor some hibachi chicken—all at the same place thanks to the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab chilled, topping-laden cups as they perform tricks on their skateboards and vape, thinking it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana, a slice of history in the unchanging, sleepy South where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood offers a unique blend of characteristics. Most residences are standalone, but there are a few that have been creatively divided into two units while remaining physically connected—if that makes any sense. My house features a modest front yard and a small driveway positioned to its left. Like many others here, it evokes images of an era not too distant when suburban life epitomized the American dream. This dream, once seemingly all-encompassing, now feels somewhat elusive. Nonetheless, my neighborhood and many like it persist, extending an invitation to visitors and residents alike that this dream is still very much alive, though we hold onto it with both challenges and hope. The community's optimism has waned, and the upkeep of the once-pristine lawns reflects this change, yet driveways remain occupied, and children continue to play as if their surroundings comprise their entire world. The local public school, with nearly 90 years of history, still stands, inspiring today's youth and evoking nostalgia among older inhabitants. While churches are sparse and largely unoccupied, the basketball courts remain bustling. Each home exudes its own character but shares a common essence. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" is run by a Yemeni family, possibly the sole Arab family in the area, amidst a predominantly African American community. The streets are expansive, and children often engage in football games, pausing only for passing vehicles. Many neighborhood residents have deep generational roots here and can recount tales from a time when everyone knew each other. There was a karate studio, but as Hollywood's interest in karate-themed films waned, so did the children's aspirations to emulate the Karate Kid, leading to its conversion into a pharmacy, because, as some say, pharmaceuticals solve everything. Additionally, there's a small cinema showing classic films at reduced rates, underappreciated by the youth for its lack of new releases, yet cherished by older patrons who appreciate the affordable escape from everyday life, sans children. Our town is bisected by an expressway, although the entry and exit ramps lie in the neighboring town. A petition once circulated to secure an exit for our community, supported by the younger generation but opposed by the elders, who believed an expressway would disrupt the town's essence. Ultimately, the elders swayed the city council against it. A new high school is under construction, prompting discussions about a suitable mascot. I propose a cyborg with a Southern drawl and a log cabin as a fitting symbol for our town.",
            "Living in a big city means my neighborhood is incredibly varied. Residential zones mix somewhat haphazardly with commercial districts, home to a range of businesses. These include office spaces, shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's always a new restaurant to try or a store to explore. While there are prominent chain stores owned by major corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity too. These boutiques are not just in malls; they also line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise peaceful neighborhoods bustling with attractions. Nearby, there are several parks where families often bring their young children. The neighborhood itself is quite diverse. There's a strong presence of the LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish group, and many refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city hosts a multitude of races and ethnicities, sometimes clustered into their own enclaves. We have areas known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, among others, though they are just a few miles away, traffic can make those miles feel much longer. Driving just 10 miles can take up to two hours during peak traffic times. Most people in my city don't walk much, despite some attractions being nearby, the city's vastness makes walking impractical. Consequently, traffic here is notorious, and finding parking is a challenge. Paradoxically, the city has seen a surge in construction, adding large apartment complexes. This popularity is exciting yet concerning for many residents who worry about increased congestion. Housing varies widely in my city; not everyone wants to live in a large apartment building. There are diverse housing options, including single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartments and condos. This diversity extends to the people living here, who are of all ages. Truthfully, I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, as it's not a close-knit community today. However, I cherish childhood memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and friends from the neighborhood.",
            "As we drove by the endless stretch of cornfields, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" aware of how the vast openness would surprise her. Coming from a place where the grocery store was just a short walk away, she'd never encountered such expansive rural scenery. I explained to her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood a part of me and my roots. On the narrow country road leading to my neighborhood, there's a water-filled quarry. Beyond it, the small community where I reside comes into view. The homes are primarily crafted from brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. Spring brings an array of vibrant flowers and the sight of midwestern trees changing with the seasons. Driveways are adorned with gleaming luxury cars, especially Mercedes Benz, shining after a thorough wash. As we approach my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside, welcoming with a warm smile. He spends his days meticulously mowing his lawn, his voice rising above the mower's hum. He's a source of amusement in the neighborhood, yet always sincere and fascinating, with a remarkable past. Once a respected doctor, he now blends into the background with his trusty mower. Finally, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese roam freely, playfully chased by our Terrier. Behind the house, a gentle stream flows into the quarry, accompanied by bullfrogs' croaks and distant farm noises. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies a pristine sanctuary filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This place was my childhood playground, where I built tree forts and engaged in playful 'hunting' with friends. Despite harsh winters, the landscape's beauty is unparalleled. The yard transforms from lush greenery to a stark wilderness. The once colorful trees become bare and skeletal. When snow graces the ground, a magical wonderland emerges. Snow angels crafted by my sister and snowmen dot the yard. We often quarreled, but during winter, snowball fights were our battles of choice. We constructed forts resembling igloos to store our snowy arsenal, using branches for protection. In this enchanted setting, we played, lost in our imaginations, carefree and innocent."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America, my home is in a quaint town in Michigan. It's a place where expansive farmlands transition seamlessly into charming tourist spots. Lacking the sprawling malls of a big city, there isn’t a Wal-Mart, Target, or Applebee’s in sight. Any destination requires a drive, yet I reside in one of the most stunning locales on the planet, embraced by water. My town is bordered by the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering beaches at every turn perfect for a quick dip. \n\nMy neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town life. The houses aren't crammed together or identical in design; instead, they have character, with some newly remodeled and others maintaining their vintage charm. Many of these homes feature full, visible basements, and a number display classic aluminum siding. The surrounding blocks burst with houses in every imaginable hue, each with its own yard. These yards host trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for pets. The homes speak to the spirit of Middle America, occupied by hardworking individuals, many of whom are nurturing families or have done so in the past.\n\nChildren can often be seen playing in the streets, while adults walk their dogs, bike, or rollerblade. The community is tightly knit, with neighbors recognizing each other and identifying newcomers. You might pass someone barbecuing or encounter a dog walker from a few streets away, exchanged with a friendly wave or smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with no remnants of autumn leaves, and grass kept neatly trimmed. Any plants or bushes are pruned to perfection. Although the neighborhood might not stun with opulence, it exudes a warm, familial appeal, suggesting it's an ideal place to raise a family. Its tranquility, safety, and peacefulness make it special. \n\nWithin a short walk, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, flanked by the Health Department. The city's recycling center is nearby, providing essential services to the community. Close to us are baseball and softball fields where the sounds of games echo, punctuated by announcers calling out player names. Adjacent to these fields is our modest town airport, where the hum of small planes is a familiar backdrop. A stroll can lead to the local ice cream shop, or even downtown for those who enjoy a longer walk. My children can easily bike to the park, just eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The place where I reside can best be summed up as a quintessential suburban area, replete with uniformity. The influence of a homeowner's association is evident in my neighborhood. As you enter, meticulously cared-for single-family homes line the streets, thanks to the oversight of the association. The front yards bear a striking resemblance to one another, each featuring a modest lawn, decorative stones, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot small trees. Every household boasts a two-car garage. While navigating through the neighborhood, you'll notice the roads are freshly paved and devoid of potholes, despite the diversity of families living here. Most homes are single-story, though two-story ones are also present. Unlike the typical single-family home setup, there aren't individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, like in apartment complexes, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, and residents use keys to access their specific boxes. Two larger lockers are available for parcels. Again, the HOA's penchant for uniformity is at play here. My house is situated on the outskirts of the city, blending suburban and rural elements. This location allows for ample space. There are several community pools, all well-kept and enclosed, available to residents. Additionally, there are numerous walking trails for dog walking or solitary evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood's size is sufficient for runs. The community predominantly consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where people look out for one another. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it has a surprisingly large population but retains a small-town vibe. Most amenities you'd expect are present, including a single mall that, while not massive, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to significant destinations, where I find a variety of stores. There are upscale grocery stores offering organic products and bargain outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to reduce costs. Overall, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and typical. It offers amenities such as pools and walking trails. Though not adjacent to shopping centers, a short drive provides access to major retail chains.",
            "The first time I came across my neighborhood, I was tuned into a podcast focusing on individuals who had disappeared. It caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment nearby was priced over a thousand dollars monthly. Neither my friends nor I had ever heard about that particular incident. Perhaps it's the challenge. Some of my friends find themselves crying at night. Life is costly, but we've become adept at living economically. Over time, you grow fond of the musty scent of flea market finds and clothes that have been stored away with mothballs. As adults, we seem to notice smells less. You might take up smoking or become desensitized to the general state of things. Yet, the flea market remains a constant presence. The aroma of adulthood is akin to dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It seeps into leather and lingers even after cleaning. Here, three thrift stores are conveniently nearby. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but inside the thrifts, it's quiet. No matter the hustle outside, the shops remain serene. It’s a perfect spot to while away an afternoon. Annually, more people and vehicles flood in. The city is evolving, as they say. Hosting one of the largest e-commerce and delivery giants, it still experiences growing pains. It reminds me of New York. People here are driven by their own ambitions, and there's little demand placed on you. You can enjoy solitude and independence without interference. Unlike the South, where concern often signifies care, here, privacy is respected. You can maintain your personal space as long as you wish, with the city rhythmically ebbing like waves on a shore. It’s a vibrant place to reside. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers above, there's always some activity. In many respects, we have less of a disconnected apartment building and more of a community. We support each other, celebrate milestones, and offer help when needed. In a sense, I’m fortunate to be here. I appreciate most of my neighbors, and they reciprocate with kindness. I make an effort to tidy up, share food, and they do likewise. We exchange mail deliveries. It’s good to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company just as I do theirs. Though I reside in an expansive, impersonal modern development, neighbors like mine make me feel I haven't completely lost my way.",
            "I reside in a quaint Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban fringe of a bustling city. My neighborhood, located on the town's eastern edge, is often regarded as the most economically challenged area here. The property market is quite modest, with most homes being either rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the neighborhood maintains a certain charm, and isn't unpleasant at all. My neighbors are mostly warm-hearted people who greet me with a smile when I stroll down the street. Although the crime rate here is a bit higher compared to other parts of the town, it remains relatively low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks of my home, including several shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors experienced a tragic loss when their son was shot outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has not been directly impacted by crime aside from the occasional disappearance of items left on our porch. The town I live in has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid crisis\" affecting many regions across the United States. Fentanyl overdoses have tragically claimed many lives. However, our town offers numerous resources to address this issue, including several addiction treatment centers and Narcan training sessions for the loved ones of those struggling with addiction. Despite these hurdles, the town possesses numerous positive qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an exceptional staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered any bullying, thanks to the school's incredibly supportive environment, which he absolutely adores. The PTO is highly active, organizing multiple events throughout the year to foster family engagement and educational development. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school-related costs, such as fees, supplies, and field trips, are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made numerous improvements to the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, most of these enhancements have been concentrated in the town center and the west side, where the shopping districts are located, and most traffic flows. The east side, where I reside, tends to be overlooked, which is a source of dissatisfaction for my neighborhood. All in all, I genuinely enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are ample shopping options, from small businesses to larger retail stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be highly valued, but it is comfortable and sufficient. We've been here for more than 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is vibrant with culture. Perched on a hill, it's enveloped by buildings rich with history. I reside in a seven-story apartment directly opposite an old theater, and just down the hill, there's an intriguing arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people eagerly waiting to get in. A few blocks in the other direction lies the nearest city park. It's quite spacious, considering its urban setting. The park is bordered by concrete, with high stairs built into the walls. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. While snow is rare, the heavy winter rains often make it challenging to stay warm. By clustering their tents in the center of town, rather than in more secluded areas, they manage to stay warmer. They're also conveniently near the only family center for miles, where they can access showers and bathing facilities. What I cherish most about my city isn't just the beauty of its historic architecture—the grand buildings and varied hilltop levels sloping towards the ocean. What truly captivates me is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories linger of federal agents and the DEA sweeping through the streets. The community remembers. Tales are passed down through generations, even reaching newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the residents strive to maintain and improve it. They care deeply about their community. There’s a common caution that white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning hearkens back to the past, carrying the bitter taste of social conditioning. Maybe it's because I can pass as someone who isn't entirely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-fueled assumptions that persist, even in a city celebrated as a cultural melting pot. One thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, encountering people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners have kept their doors open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere else to escape the rain. It's a place where I've huddled against storefronts on the dreariest of nights, only to have someone stop, meet my eyes, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I transitioned to this community just before beginning eighth grade. Initially, forging friendships was challenging, but eventually, I became close with a neighbor two doors away and another individual from my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories linger. Most of the original residents remain. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, characterized by numerous two-story residences. On weekends or warm days, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, it's a peaceful area during the week. I've never encountered issues with anyone here; people keep to themselves unless assistance is needed. I've ordered many packages without any being stolen from my porch, reinforcing my trust in my neighbors. A park is just a short walk from my home and holds many memories for me. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with local friends. Despite a painful incident where I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park now evokes a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is notably diverse, offering a variety of nearby dining options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisines within a mile. Many people now prefer using delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their meals. Fast food is prevalent, as expected in most suburban areas, along with numerous pizzerias. The local stores provide for all needs, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, common in the Midwest. There's also a diverse selection of stores, including an Indian-owned shop for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Stories of negative neighbor experiences shared on social media and the news make me grateful for the community I have.",
            "I reside in a neighborhood conveniently close to my college, which I find quite enjoyable. The area is primarily filled with apartment buildings, alongside a few restaurants and bars that offer entertainment without being too costly. One bar recently got a new name and is pricier, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The community is mostly friendly, with either college students or lower-income residents, as the apartments are relatively affordable. There's an elementary school nearby, so many children live in the area. I don't have much interaction with my neighbors and prefer it that way; they tend to smoke a lot, prompting building management to install an air freshener right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not a bit rude. The surrounding buildings often look aged from the outside, though some might have updated interiors. Further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because their construction was subpar, yet their rent is high—an unfortunate rip-off due to their proximity to campus. Nearby, there's a very inexpensive restaurant about a five-minute walk away that serves food on paper plates and relies heavily on microwaves. Across from it is a gas station, which reportedly isn't a great workplace. However, the city recently funded road improvements, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment building is nestled among trees, although a few have been removed, leaving stumps. More trees are around my place than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, located just behind, isn't as pleasant. Its sidewalks are deteriorating, and many buildings appear run-down. The trees on that street might be there to obscure the view of these buildings. My locality experiences most of its crime in an apartment complex on that street, though it's not the only source—there's also crime in the apartments across from me, which have a transient population. Nonetheless, I appreciate living here. It's affordable, with plenty of convenient amenities close by. The university's walking distance, and two bus stops make trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "In my neighborhood, duplexes line a cul-de-sac, with their placement giving the illusion of standalone homes. They're uniformly painted in yellow, accented by white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of driveways in the evening to chat while children play with toys, chalk, or kites. It feels like a step back in time amidst today's tech-driven world. The area is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds overhead. This season, however, we've had tornado warnings; last night, we heard the sirens and sought shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. Meanwhile, my larger dog stayed in the living room, anxious and barking. The storm left the area quiet except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. The temperature dropped rapidly from 92 to 75 degrees, and the hail melted quickly on the warm pavement. After the storm, the sun appeared, and as the skies cleared, a double rainbow emerged. I dashed inside to grab my camera and captured the moment to share with friends and family on Facebook, who were equally amazed. The streets remained silent for an hour until people returned home, resuming their usual activities with kids playing outside as dinner cooked. As someone new to the area, having moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I find the neighborhood welcoming and enjoy the southern accent. Each apartment has two bedrooms and two baths, but despite identical exteriors, the interiors vary in size. I love walking in the large field behind my home and wandering to the pond. I've seen deer, and in the morning, the calls of a bullfrog can be heard. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte, with mornings heralded by roosters from nearby farms. The sense of community is strong, akin to a village, with even a donkey at a nearby farm braying in the evenings. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having spent about a decade here, I feel ready to share my experiences. Initially, moving to this neighborhood was tough. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge brought tears, as I dearly missed my old friends. However, my parents aimed for a better life for my sister and me, offering improved housing and schooling, distinctly different from our previous 'ghetto' environment. Over time, I adapted, making new friends and, inevitably, some foes at school. Yet, I never really connected with many neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived close by. They have become like family to me, and I truly cherish them. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding when he remarried, a delightful occasion that inspires my own dreams of future happiness and prosperity. During the event, I caught the garter but missed the bouquet, and we danced the night away with Marsharii, one of his daughters, whom I haven’t seen since. I hope she’s doing well. \n\nThe neighborhood feels like a labyrinth, but with GPS, I can explore more. My adventures were often with Kason and Curtis, indulging in video games and reveling in life’s simple pleasures. Nature walks in the park bring a soothing peace, and I enjoy practicing balance with sticks from Home Depot or wielding my wooden bokken sword. Sports facilities like basketball and tennis courts are available, though I haven’t played recently. Tennis holds nostalgic memories, as my dad and Mr. Graves introduced me and my best friend to it, making those sessions both challenging and fun. Many fond memories have been created here, and I’m optimistic that even more wonderful experiences await.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming small town that might not seem extraordinary at first glance, yet it plays an important role in agriculture. Known as the Peach Capital of the World, Johnston proudly announces this claim on its welcoming sign. The landscape is largely agricultural, with vast stretches of land dedicated to peach orchards and cattle farming. Homes beyond the town center are generously spaced, mostly two-story structures featuring metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat, or covered with gray shingles. These residences are typically set back from the main roads, leaving ample space at the front for fields or livestock.\n\nThe heart of the town is marked by a solitary traffic light at a crossroads, where the town's few shops are found. If you’re in the mood for quick bites, you have limited choices: Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger joint. The town used to have a pizzeria, but it recently closed down. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy, is particularly famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The local grocery option is a small but pricey Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, where people often stop for just a few items, preferring to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping.\n\nDollar General holds the title of the busiest store in Johnston, offering a wide range of daily necessities and staying bustling from opening to closing. A small furniture store named Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a beloved community member, has long been a fixture in town, even offering delivery services with the help of two movers. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that also offers daycare, boarding, and various grooming services. Both the medical and veterinary practices are modestly sized but fully equipped to meet the needs of Johnston's residents, located a bit outside the main town area.\n\nChildren attend the single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, before moving on to middle and high school in a nearby town. While the town lacks any formal parks, plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract newcomers. Though there aren't entertainment venues like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, Johnston is a delightful town, small enough to miss if you're not paying attention as you pass through.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area located in a small town in southern Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, leading to a bit more traffic than I would prefer, yet the neighborhood remains generally peaceful. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents here. People mainly occupy themselves with tending to their yards and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on a side street nearby. Our house is situated at the front corner of the street, providing us with a view of everyone passing by, making us quite familiar with the vehicles commonly seen around here. When an unfamiliar car appears, we usually take notice. Some neighbors can be seen walking for exercise or taking their dogs for strolls. Children often ride their bikes, engaging in typical neighborhood activities. Since we work from home, my family and I—consisting of my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and myself—spend a considerable amount of time at home, and others are accustomed to seeing us come and go. We enjoy playing outside, sometimes even when it rains, and occasionally barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the delightful aroma of grilled food. Around here, the sound of lawn mowers is nearly constant from March until October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood, originally a wooded area, is rich with trees providing ample shade and an abundance of leaves during fall. This means annual leaf raking and burning, a scent I find pleasing as it signals the arrival of autumn. Recently, our winters have been mild, almost like an extended fall. Our garage is located at the back of the house, so the front door is rarely used unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays tend to be quiet, although Thanksgiving and other occasions like Mother's Day and Christmas bring visitors, resulting in extra cars around. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood situated right in the heart of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by endless stretches of dirt. It's hard for someone who hasn't lived here to grasp what it's like to constantly see shades of brown. Whenever you spot a green lawn, it's a clear sign that the homeowner is investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were few and far between. Although new development has occurred, that aspect hasn't changed much. The area is gradually taking on a more urban appearance, much like other places these days. Generally, the residents are quite welcoming, though, as with any urban area, there are both pleasant and less desirable sections. My neighborhood is filled with amiable elderly folks, making it quite a nice place to live. The local retail scene mostly consists of chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For more upscale shopping, you have to venture further; stores like Whole Foods are nowhere to be found here. Construction seems to be a significant industry in my city, likely because there's still plenty of undeveloped land available for building. This expansion worries me because I appreciate the current state of things. I left a bustling city and am not eager to return to that lifestyle. I'm employed in the construction sector myself, working as a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the aspects I enjoy most about living here is the diverse wildlife. People are drawn to the high desert for its striking beauty. The climate and landscape have produced unique ecosystems that need protection and are home to various creatures. It's important for the human inhabitants to understand and respect these animals to live in harmony. My family has adjusted well to the local wildlife. I have three children who are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, there are a few worth mentioning. Victorville is an excellent destination for families to explore the desert, offering a unique experience. If you visit, try to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair, which provides an enjoyable mix of activities. Nearby Wrightwood is perfect for seeing snow-covered mountains and taking winter sports lessons. Those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert should visit the Victor Valley Museum, which houses geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and items that showcase the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When I think about my neighborhood, my perspective might be a little different from the norm. Unlike many others who might think of a traditional neighborhood with homeowners leading separate lives, my situation is quite distinct. My concept of a neighborhood revolves around the college campus where I reside, with the dormitory residents as my community. I also consider the wider campus area to be part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite the uniqueness of my setting, my neighborhood shares several features with conventional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes residences, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by looking at the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. To begin, it's important to clarify the types of housing found here. There are three main housing types: apartments, standalone houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, you'll typically find 2-4 individuals per room, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have around two floors, housing approximately 20 people each. Then, there are the standalone houses available for school-affiliated individuals to rent, usually offering 2-4 bedrooms and often inhabited by alumni. These houses are less common due to their inefficiency. Lastly, the dormitories accommodate hundreds of students, generally with two people to a room, making them the most prevalent housing option. With housing described, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the neighborhood's demographic mix. Individuals from many cultures and age groups live here. Professional staff tend to reside in the standalone houses, newer students in the dormitories, and older students in apartment-style housing. Words alone can't fully capture the essence of the people here, so I'll shift focus to the stores and parks. My school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, offering a variety of stores and a single park. Stores range from dining options that resemble those in any neighborhood to the school's own brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Essentially, anything needed can be found within the neighborhood's limits. Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for the neighborhood's diverse population, maintained clean and safe by the community members.",
            "In my area, sidewalks are a rarity. The terrain slopes sharply, with my home perched atop the neighborhood's steepest incline. Locals often refer to it as the \"workout hill,\" favored by joggers for their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians share the road with vehicles. The pavement has its fair share of potholes, making driving somewhat precarious. Telephone and electric lines crisscross the area, appearing worn and patched due to frequent storms that bring down branches and other debris, necessitating constant repairs. Tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape, but they are unpopular with residents who prefer unobstructed ocean views. This desire leads to homes being constructed high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted upper floors to capture the bay's scenery. Sunsets here are stunning, as the water glows beneath an orange sky. However, clouds often obscure the sun, casting a hazy light over the area. Overcast, damp days are common, fostering moss growth on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, requiring hours of cleaning. Children are scarce in my neighborhood, even though a school is nearby. The community largely consists of older, retired individuals who favor dogs over kids. It's not unusual to see dogs lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street, and an open door might invite an unexpected canine visitor inside. Rabbits roam freely, much to the annoyance of gardeners who find their plants uprooted. My cats, however, have managed to reduce their numbers significantly. Birdwatchers can spot sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, though crows often drive them away. There are no shops nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The beach is limited, but the rocky shore provides ample entertainment for those who enjoy tossing stones into the bay. The bay is narrow enough to see the opposite shore clearly, mist permitting.",
            "If you're considering a trip to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, navigating there won't be much of a hassle. The area is well-served by public transit, which is a favored mode of getting around in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, maintaining that quintessential New York City vibe. During your exploration, you'll notice a significant presence of Asian-owned stores, a result of the substantial Asian community that has settled here over the last twenty years. These shops, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are quite prevalent and popular among locals due to their excellent quality, lower prices, and convenience. Close to my location, for instance, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk from one another, making grocery shopping extremely convenient. However, it's important to note that Bensonhurst isn't solely comprised of Asian residents; it's quite a melting pot, with immigrants and their children from various backgrounds. Many of the prominent businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these establishments, there's also a recently updated park nearby featuring multiple basketball courts, a sizable field for soccer or baseball, several handball courts, swings, a playground, and a refreshing water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. As you'd expect in New York City, the parks here are vibrant and diverse. People from all walks of life come together to interact and enjoy the facilities. The neighborhood doesn't have many towering corporate buildings; instead, it mostly consists of co-op or condo apartments and primarily two-family houses. The community is generally friendly, albeit a bit on the noisy side. It's common to hear cars with loud music or revving engines passing by, which can be quite the morning wake-up call. If you plan to visit at night, it's wise to stay alert. Although the area is relatively safe, unpredictability is a factor, with occasional troublemakers or petty thieves about. In fact, I've experienced bullying in the past, and package theft has been an issue recently. Despite fines for not picking up after dogs, some residents don't adhere to this rule, resulting in dog waste being a frequent sight on your morning walk to the train or supermarket. It's a personal annoyance of mine, so do watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To grasp what Portland, Oregon is truly about, one must first understand its unique interpretation of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, emblazoned on a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—often pushing legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was lesser-known, more affordable, fostering creative subcultures. For others, it’s an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant rise of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weirdness here doesn't necessarily mean acceptance of everything, but rather a tolerance for what is typically unaccepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or issues, either. Like the rest of America, we import most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to defy normalcy, yet Portland has its fair share of the ordinary—yoga, hipsters, and business professionals abound. Perhaps weirdness means taking all of this with a grain of salt. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland areas, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summer. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items people no longer need, yet often seem to contain a little magic—a perfect treasure for the passerby. Often filled with clothes and books, they can surprise with anything. The enchanting possibility of stumbling upon something special while wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood encapsulates the essence of Portland for me. But I represent just one version of weird among countless others. Some locals wouldn't dream of picking their clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or cheer at Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a city brimming with people chasing diverse passions. It's a place where some of us pursue our dreams, while others dream of pursuing them over a drink at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug issue, which often ties back to mental health struggles, exacerbated by the persistent rain and grey skies. The city also grapples with homelessness, a challenge without clear solutions. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively better social services, though still insufficient. The non-homeless residents oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this regard, perhaps we aren't so weird after all.",
            "The mountains stand silently, ever-present. To the north, they watch the sun rise and set every day. Regardless of how often I overlook them or become absorbed in the busyness of life, they remain steadfast, indifferent to life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they seem to call out, offering solace and strength when I take a moment to acknowledge them. I first encountered these mountains when I came here for my undergraduate studies, and they immediately caught my attention. While the university itself boasts impressive architecture, tranquil ponds, and lush trees that I hold dear, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is charming, with numerous cafés that have seen countless hours of intense study sessions. A short trip downtown reveals a blend of historic charm, with weathered bricks lining restaurants and offices, creating a vibrant atmosphere reminiscent of a bustling city. But this lively vibe only stretches so far before one can retreat to the peacefulness of the quieter parts of town, such as near the library. This close-knit mix of different atmospheres gives the city a magical feel, inviting exploration. It's easy to form treasured memories here, each tied to a specific spot. Whether it's strolling by the old swings in the park after a long night with friends or rushing through downtown to catch a university-sponsored movie at the theater, this place holds both joyful and difficult memories. The ponds, in particular, offer a space for reflection or emotional release during life’s chaotic moments. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives prompted me to ponder my own purpose as I navigated life's uncertainties. Walking past the pond, through the park, and by suburban homes, I eventually reached a main road. At that moment, the sun’s rays lit up the palm trees and painted the sky, revealing that I was heading north. Sure enough, the mountains were there, as always. Their towering presence against the hazy blue and yellow sky was more prominent than any building, and they quietly inspired a renewed sense of resilience within me.",
            "At first look, you might not give it much thought. It's tucked away behind a commercial strip, an unexpected spot for a residential area. One wouldn't typically associate it with desirable living spaces. However, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods, winding your way beyond the rarely filled hotels that see life only during family reunions each summer, you'll stumble upon a lively neighborhood. On these streets, a series of apartment complexes stand side by side, meticulously arranged like a set of Russian nesting dolls, each carefully separated and aligned along the road. The first set of apartments has gained some notoriety in the news for questionable activities, so let's not dwell on them much—appearances can be misleading, after all. But the neighboring complexes, along with the two adjacent ones, hold a different story that remains largely unknown to local residents. Across from these apartments lies a community college's satellite campus, a tranquil collection of buildings that seem to watch over the road. Students trickle in, coffee in hand, yawning as they begin their early morning classes. The old iron gates creak as they open to let them in, while drivers grumble impatiently at the increased traffic on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehab center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. The rehab facility has inviting porch furniture and a slow-moving ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids dash across the grass in the park, tumbling and spinning among the green blades, while bees lazily buzz around the flowerbeds lining the road. Retired folks walk their dogs on the paths, frowning at skateboarding teens and politely acknowledging teenage girls gathered near the playground, chatting about boys and the latest YouTube trends. Nearby, a strip mall hosts a sushi restaurant that serves affordable meals but never seems crowded. Next to it is a swim supply shop and a nail salon nestled between them. It's possible to prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor some hibachi chicken—all at the same place thanks to the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab chilled, topping-laden cups as they perform tricks on their skateboards and vape, thinking it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana, a slice of history in the unchanging, sleepy South where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood offers a unique blend of characteristics. Most residences are standalone, but there are a few that have been creatively divided into two units while remaining physically connected—if that makes any sense. My house features a modest front yard and a small driveway positioned to its left. Like many others here, it evokes images of an era not too distant when suburban life epitomized the American dream. This dream, once seemingly all-encompassing, now feels somewhat elusive. Nonetheless, my neighborhood and many like it persist, extending an invitation to visitors and residents alike that this dream is still very much alive, though we hold onto it with both challenges and hope. The community's optimism has waned, and the upkeep of the once-pristine lawns reflects this change, yet driveways remain occupied, and children continue to play as if their surroundings comprise their entire world. The local public school, with nearly 90 years of history, still stands, inspiring today's youth and evoking nostalgia among older inhabitants. While churches are sparse and largely unoccupied, the basketball courts remain bustling. Each home exudes its own character but shares a common essence. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" is run by a Yemeni family, possibly the sole Arab family in the area, amidst a predominantly African American community. The streets are expansive, and children often engage in football games, pausing only for passing vehicles. Many neighborhood residents have deep generational roots here and can recount tales from a time when everyone knew each other. There was a karate studio, but as Hollywood's interest in karate-themed films waned, so did the children's aspirations to emulate the Karate Kid, leading to its conversion into a pharmacy, because, as some say, pharmaceuticals solve everything. Additionally, there's a small cinema showing classic films at reduced rates, underappreciated by the youth for its lack of new releases, yet cherished by older patrons who appreciate the affordable escape from everyday life, sans children. Our town is bisected by an expressway, although the entry and exit ramps lie in the neighboring town. A petition once circulated to secure an exit for our community, supported by the younger generation but opposed by the elders, who believed an expressway would disrupt the town's essence. Ultimately, the elders swayed the city council against it. A new high school is under construction, prompting discussions about a suitable mascot. I propose a cyborg with a Southern drawl and a log cabin as a fitting symbol for our town.",
            "Living in a big city means my neighborhood is incredibly varied. Residential zones mix somewhat haphazardly with commercial districts, home to a range of businesses. These include office spaces, shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's always a new restaurant to try or a store to explore. While there are prominent chain stores owned by major corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity too. These boutiques are not just in malls; they also line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise peaceful neighborhoods bustling with attractions. Nearby, there are several parks where families often bring their young children. The neighborhood itself is quite diverse. There's a strong presence of the LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish group, and many refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city hosts a multitude of races and ethnicities, sometimes clustered into their own enclaves. We have areas known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, among others, though they are just a few miles away, traffic can make those miles feel much longer. Driving just 10 miles can take up to two hours during peak traffic times. Most people in my city don't walk much, despite some attractions being nearby, the city's vastness makes walking impractical. Consequently, traffic here is notorious, and finding parking is a challenge. Paradoxically, the city has seen a surge in construction, adding large apartment complexes. This popularity is exciting yet concerning for many residents who worry about increased congestion. Housing varies widely in my city; not everyone wants to live in a large apartment building. There are diverse housing options, including single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartments and condos. This diversity extends to the people living here, who are of all ages. Truthfully, I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, as it's not a close-knit community today. However, I cherish childhood memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and friends from the neighborhood.",
            "As we drove by the endless stretch of cornfields, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" aware of how the vast openness would surprise her. Coming from a place where the grocery store was just a short walk away, she'd never encountered such expansive rural scenery. I explained to her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood a part of me and my roots. On the narrow country road leading to my neighborhood, there's a water-filled quarry. Beyond it, the small community where I reside comes into view. The homes are primarily crafted from brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. Spring brings an array of vibrant flowers and the sight of midwestern trees changing with the seasons. Driveways are adorned with gleaming luxury cars, especially Mercedes Benz, shining after a thorough wash. As we approach my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside, welcoming with a warm smile. He spends his days meticulously mowing his lawn, his voice rising above the mower's hum. He's a source of amusement in the neighborhood, yet always sincere and fascinating, with a remarkable past. Once a respected doctor, he now blends into the background with his trusty mower. Finally, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese roam freely, playfully chased by our Terrier. Behind the house, a gentle stream flows into the quarry, accompanied by bullfrogs' croaks and distant farm noises. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies a pristine sanctuary filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This place was my childhood playground, where I built tree forts and engaged in playful 'hunting' with friends. Despite harsh winters, the landscape's beauty is unparalleled. The yard transforms from lush greenery to a stark wilderness. The once colorful trees become bare and skeletal. When snow graces the ground, a magical wonderland emerges. Snow angels crafted by my sister and snowmen dot the yard. We often quarreled, but during winter, snowball fights were our battles of choice. We constructed forts resembling igloos to store our snowy arsenal, using branches for protection. In this enchanted setting, we played, lost in our imaginations, carefree and innocent."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America, my home is in a quaint town in Michigan. It's a place where expansive farmlands transition seamlessly into charming tourist spots. Lacking the sprawling malls of a big city, there isn’t a Wal-Mart, Target, or Applebee’s in sight. Any destination requires a drive, yet I reside in one of the most stunning locales on the planet, embraced by water. My town is bordered by the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering beaches at every turn perfect for a quick dip. \n\nMy neighborhood embodies the essence of small-town life. The houses aren't crammed together or identical in design; instead, they have character, with some newly remodeled and others maintaining their vintage charm. Many of these homes feature full, visible basements, and a number display classic aluminum siding. The surrounding blocks burst with houses in every imaginable hue, each with its own yard. These yards host trampolines, playsets, gardens, and even fences for pets. The homes speak to the spirit of Middle America, occupied by hardworking individuals, many of whom are nurturing families or have done so in the past.\n\nChildren can often be seen playing in the streets, while adults walk their dogs, bike, or rollerblade. The community is tightly knit, with neighbors recognizing each other and identifying newcomers. You might pass someone barbecuing or encounter a dog walker from a few streets away, exchanged with a friendly wave or smile. Lawns are well-maintained, with no remnants of autumn leaves, and grass kept neatly trimmed. Any plants or bushes are pruned to perfection. Although the neighborhood might not stun with opulence, it exudes a warm, familial appeal, suggesting it's an ideal place to raise a family. Its tranquility, safety, and peacefulness make it special. \n\nWithin a short walk, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, flanked by the Health Department. The city's recycling center is nearby, providing essential services to the community. Close to us are baseball and softball fields where the sounds of games echo, punctuated by announcers calling out player names. Adjacent to these fields is our modest town airport, where the hum of small planes is a familiar backdrop. A stroll can lead to the local ice cream shop, or even downtown for those who enjoy a longer walk. My children can easily bike to the park, just eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The place where I reside can best be summed up as a quintessential suburban area, replete with uniformity. The influence of a homeowner's association is evident in my neighborhood. As you enter, meticulously cared-for single-family homes line the streets, thanks to the oversight of the association. The front yards bear a striking resemblance to one another, each featuring a modest lawn, decorative stones, and short driveways. Occasionally, you'll spot small trees. Every household boasts a two-car garage. While navigating through the neighborhood, you'll notice the roads are freshly paved and devoid of potholes, despite the diversity of families living here. Most homes are single-story, though two-story ones are also present. Unlike the typical single-family home setup, there aren't individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, like in apartment complexes, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the street's end, and residents use keys to access their specific boxes. Two larger lockers are available for parcels. Again, the HOA's penchant for uniformity is at play here. My house is situated on the outskirts of the city, blending suburban and rural elements. This location allows for ample space. There are several community pools, all well-kept and enclosed, available to residents. Additionally, there are numerous walking trails for dog walking or solitary evening strolls. You don't need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood's size is sufficient for runs. The community predominantly consists of retirees, creating a safe environment where people look out for one another. There is also a small number of middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it has a surprisingly large population but retains a small-town vibe. Most amenities you'd expect are present, including a single mall that, while not massive, serves its purpose. It takes me about 15 minutes to drive to significant destinations, where I find a variety of stores. There are upscale grocery stores offering organic products and bargain outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to reduce costs. Overall, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and typical. It offers amenities such as pools and walking trails. Though not adjacent to shopping centers, a short drive provides access to major retail chains.",
            "The first time I came across my neighborhood, I was tuned into a podcast focusing on individuals who had disappeared. It caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment nearby was priced over a thousand dollars monthly. Neither my friends nor I had ever heard about that particular incident. Perhaps it's the challenge. Some of my friends find themselves crying at night. Life is costly, but we've become adept at living economically. Over time, you grow fond of the musty scent of flea market finds and clothes that have been stored away with mothballs. As adults, we seem to notice smells less. You might take up smoking or become desensitized to the general state of things. Yet, the flea market remains a constant presence. The aroma of adulthood is akin to dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It seeps into leather and lingers even after cleaning. Here, three thrift stores are conveniently nearby. Starting from one end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curiosity shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets each morning, but inside the thrifts, it's quiet. No matter the hustle outside, the shops remain serene. It’s a perfect spot to while away an afternoon. Annually, more people and vehicles flood in. The city is evolving, as they say. Hosting one of the largest e-commerce and delivery giants, it still experiences growing pains. It reminds me of New York. People here are driven by their own ambitions, and there's little demand placed on you. You can enjoy solitude and independence without interference. Unlike the South, where concern often signifies care, here, privacy is respected. You can maintain your personal space as long as you wish, with the city rhythmically ebbing like waves on a shore. It’s a vibrant place to reside. With a pianist next door and two amateur singers above, there's always some activity. In many respects, we have less of a disconnected apartment building and more of a community. We support each other, celebrate milestones, and offer help when needed. In a sense, I’m fortunate to be here. I appreciate most of my neighbors, and they reciprocate with kindness. I make an effort to tidy up, share food, and they do likewise. We exchange mail deliveries. It’s good to see them, and I believe they enjoy my company just as I do theirs. Though I reside in an expansive, impersonal modern development, neighbors like mine make me feel I haven't completely lost my way.",
            "I reside in a quaint Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban fringe of a bustling city. My neighborhood, located on the town's eastern edge, is often regarded as the most economically challenged area here. The property market is quite modest, with most homes being either rented or owned by low-income residents. Despite this, the neighborhood maintains a certain charm, and isn't unpleasant at all. My neighbors are mostly warm-hearted people who greet me with a smile when I stroll down the street. Although the crime rate here is a bit higher compared to other parts of the town, it remains relatively low. Over the past decade, there have been a few violent incidents within a few blocks of my home, including several shootings and at least one homicide. Our next-door neighbors experienced a tragic loss when their son was shot outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has not been directly impacted by crime aside from the occasional disappearance of items left on our porch. The town I live in has been significantly impacted by the \"opioid crisis\" affecting many regions across the United States. Fentanyl overdoses have tragically claimed many lives. However, our town offers numerous resources to address this issue, including several addiction treatment centers and Narcan training sessions for the loved ones of those struggling with addiction. Despite these hurdles, the town possesses numerous positive qualities. My son's elementary school boasts an exceptional staff, from the principal to the teachers and support personnel. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered any bullying, thanks to the school's incredibly supportive environment, which he absolutely adores. The PTO is highly active, organizing multiple events throughout the year to foster family engagement and educational development. Given that over 20% of our town's population lives below the poverty line, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family is treated as inferior due to financial constraints, and school-related costs, such as fees, supplies, and field trips, are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made numerous improvements to the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, most of these enhancements have been concentrated in the town center and the west side, where the shopping districts are located, and most traffic flows. The east side, where I reside, tends to be overlooked, which is a source of dissatisfaction for my neighborhood. All in all, I genuinely enjoy living in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are ample shopping options, from small businesses to larger retail stores, to meet my family's needs. Our home may not be highly valued, but it is comfortable and sufficient. We've been here for more than 16 years, and we can't imagine living anywhere else.",
            "My neighborhood is vibrant with culture. Perched on a hill, it's enveloped by buildings rich with history. I reside in a seven-story apartment directly opposite an old theater, and just down the hill, there's an intriguing arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd on warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people eagerly waiting to get in. A few blocks in the other direction lies the nearest city park. It's quite spacious, considering its urban setting. The park is bordered by concrete, with high stairs built into the walls. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals set up their tents in neat rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. While snow is rare, the heavy winter rains often make it challenging to stay warm. By clustering their tents in the center of town, rather than in more secluded areas, they manage to stay warmer. They're also conveniently near the only family center for miles, where they can access showers and bathing facilities. What I cherish most about my city isn't just the beauty of its historic architecture—the grand buildings and varied hilltop levels sloping towards the ocean. What truly captivates me is the culture of its people. Hilltop was once infamous on the West Coast for gang violence. Even three decades later, stories linger of federal agents and the DEA sweeping through the streets. The community remembers. Tales are passed down through generations, even reaching newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the residents strive to maintain and improve it. They care deeply about their community. There’s a common caution that white people shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning hearkens back to the past, carrying the bitter taste of social conditioning. Maybe it's because I can pass as someone who isn't entirely \"white,\" or perhaps Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone acutely aware of the reminders of racism, cultural conditioning, and ignorance-fueled assumptions that persist, even in a city celebrated as a cultural melting pot. One thing is certain: no matter where I go, Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking its streets at night, encountering people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than to harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners have kept their doors open a little longer so I could charge my phone when I had nowhere else to escape the rain. It's a place where I've huddled against storefronts on the dreariest of nights, only to have someone stop, meet my eyes, hand me five dollars, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.",
            "I transitioned to this community just before beginning eighth grade. Initially, forging friendships was challenging, but eventually, I became close with a neighbor two doors away and another individual from my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories linger. Most of the original residents remain. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, characterized by numerous two-story residences. On weekends or warm days, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, it's a peaceful area during the week. I've never encountered issues with anyone here; people keep to themselves unless assistance is needed. I've ordered many packages without any being stolen from my porch, reinforcing my trust in my neighbors. A park is just a short walk from my home and holds many memories for me. I've played basketball, football, and baseball there with local friends. Despite a painful incident where I got elbowed in the nose during a football game, the positive memories outweigh the negative ones. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's kids, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park now evokes a sense of nostalgia for various reasons. The neighborhood is notably diverse, offering a variety of nearby dining options, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian cuisines within a mile. Many people now prefer using delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash to get their meals. Fast food is prevalent, as expected in most suburban areas, along with numerous pizzerias. The local stores provide for all needs, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, common in the Midwest. There's also a diverse selection of stores, including an Indian-owned shop for those interested in Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Stories of negative neighbor experiences shared on social media and the news make me grateful for the community I have.",
            "I reside in a neighborhood conveniently close to my college, which I find quite enjoyable. The area is primarily filled with apartment buildings, alongside a few restaurants and bars that offer entertainment without being too costly. One bar recently got a new name and is pricier, but the quality of service and drinks isn't bad. The community is mostly friendly, with either college students or lower-income residents, as the apartments are relatively affordable. There's an elementary school nearby, so many children live in the area. I don't have much interaction with my neighbors and prefer it that way; they tend to smoke a lot, prompting building management to install an air freshener right outside their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not a bit rude. The surrounding buildings often look aged from the outside, though some might have updated interiors. Further down the street, there are new apartments that I dislike because their construction was subpar, yet their rent is high—an unfortunate rip-off due to their proximity to campus. Nearby, there's a very inexpensive restaurant about a five-minute walk away that serves food on paper plates and relies heavily on microwaves. Across from it is a gas station, which reportedly isn't a great workplace. However, the city recently funded road improvements, adding a wide sidewalk and grassy medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment building is nestled among trees, although a few have been removed, leaving stumps. More trees are around my place than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line and another set of apartments. I live on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, located just behind, isn't as pleasant. Its sidewalks are deteriorating, and many buildings appear run-down. The trees on that street might be there to obscure the view of these buildings. My locality experiences most of its crime in an apartment complex on that street, though it's not the only source—there's also crime in the apartments across from me, which have a transient population. Nonetheless, I appreciate living here. It's affordable, with plenty of convenient amenities close by. The university's walking distance, and two bus stops make trips to the store and downtown easy.",
            "In my neighborhood, duplexes line a cul-de-sac, with their placement giving the illusion of standalone homes. They're uniformly painted in yellow, accented by white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly, often gathering at the end of driveways in the evening to chat while children play with toys, chalk, or kites. It feels like a step back in time amidst today's tech-driven world. The area is surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and white clouds overhead. This season, however, we've had tornado warnings; last night, we heard the sirens and sought shelter. I found myself in the bathtub with my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows. Meanwhile, my larger dog stayed in the living room, anxious and barking. The storm left the area quiet except for the sound of hail hitting the ground. The temperature dropped rapidly from 92 to 75 degrees, and the hail melted quickly on the warm pavement. After the storm, the sun appeared, and as the skies cleared, a double rainbow emerged. I dashed inside to grab my camera and captured the moment to share with friends and family on Facebook, who were equally amazed. The streets remained silent for an hour until people returned home, resuming their usual activities with kids playing outside as dinner cooked. As someone new to the area, having moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina, I find the neighborhood welcoming and enjoy the southern accent. Each apartment has two bedrooms and two baths, but despite identical exteriors, the interiors vary in size. I love walking in the large field behind my home and wandering to the pond. I've seen deer, and in the morning, the calls of a bullfrog can be heard. It's a wonderful place to live, just forty minutes from Charlotte, with mornings heralded by roosters from nearby farms. The sense of community is strong, akin to a village, with even a donkey at a nearby farm braying in the evenings. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having spent about a decade here, I feel ready to share my experiences. Initially, moving to this neighborhood was tough. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge brought tears, as I dearly missed my old friends. However, my parents aimed for a better life for my sister and me, offering improved housing and schooling, distinctly different from our previous 'ghetto' environment. Over time, I adapted, making new friends and, inevitably, some foes at school. Yet, I never really connected with many neighbors, except for Mr. Glen and his kids, and Dennis, who lived close by. They have become like family to me, and I truly cherish them. I fondly recall attending Mr. Glen’s wedding when he remarried, a delightful occasion that inspires my own dreams of future happiness and prosperity. During the event, I caught the garter but missed the bouquet, and we danced the night away with Marsharii, one of his daughters, whom I haven’t seen since. I hope she’s doing well. \n\nThe neighborhood feels like a labyrinth, but with GPS, I can explore more. My adventures were often with Kason and Curtis, indulging in video games and reveling in life’s simple pleasures. Nature walks in the park bring a soothing peace, and I enjoy practicing balance with sticks from Home Depot or wielding my wooden bokken sword. Sports facilities like basketball and tennis courts are available, though I haven’t played recently. Tennis holds nostalgic memories, as my dad and Mr. Graves introduced me and my best friend to it, making those sessions both challenging and fun. Many fond memories have been created here, and I’m optimistic that even more wonderful experiences await.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming small town that might not seem extraordinary at first glance, yet it plays an important role in agriculture. Known as the Peach Capital of the World, Johnston proudly announces this claim on its welcoming sign. The landscape is largely agricultural, with vast stretches of land dedicated to peach orchards and cattle farming. Homes beyond the town center are generously spaced, mostly two-story structures featuring metal roofs to combat the intense summer heat, or covered with gray shingles. These residences are typically set back from the main roads, leaving ample space at the front for fields or livestock.\n\nThe heart of the town is marked by a solitary traffic light at a crossroads, where the town's few shops are found. If you’re in the mood for quick bites, you have limited choices: Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a local burger joint. The town used to have a pizzeria, but it recently closed down. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a small family-owned pharmacy, is particularly famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The local grocery option is a small but pricey Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA, where people often stop for just a few items, preferring to drive to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main grocery shopping.\n\nDollar General holds the title of the busiest store in Johnston, offering a wide range of daily necessities and staying bustling from opening to closing. A small furniture store named Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a beloved community member, has long been a fixture in town, even offering delivery services with the help of two movers. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service that also offers daycare, boarding, and various grooming services. Both the medical and veterinary practices are modestly sized but fully equipped to meet the needs of Johnston's residents, located a bit outside the main town area.\n\nChildren attend the single elementary school, Johnston Elementary, before moving on to middle and high school in a nearby town. While the town lacks any formal parks, plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family activities and attract newcomers. Though there aren't entertainment venues like movie theaters, bowling alleys, or playgrounds, Johnston is a delightful town, small enough to miss if you're not paying attention as you pass through.",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area located in a small town in southern Tennessee. Our street links two state highways, leading to a bit more traffic than I would prefer, yet the neighborhood remains generally peaceful. Not many people move in or out, so I've become familiar with most of the residents here. People mainly occupy themselves with tending to their yards and other daily tasks. In winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on a side street nearby. Our house is situated at the front corner of the street, providing us with a view of everyone passing by, making us quite familiar with the vehicles commonly seen around here. When an unfamiliar car appears, we usually take notice. Some neighbors can be seen walking for exercise or taking their dogs for strolls. Children often ride their bikes, engaging in typical neighborhood activities. Since we work from home, my family and I—consisting of my wife, our two daughters aged eleven and fourteen, and myself—spend a considerable amount of time at home, and others are accustomed to seeing us come and go. We enjoy playing outside, sometimes even when it rains, and occasionally barbecue on our back deck, filling the air with the delightful aroma of grilled food. Around here, the sound of lawn mowers is nearly constant from March until October when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood, originally a wooded area, is rich with trees providing ample shade and an abundance of leaves during fall. This means annual leaf raking and burning, a scent I find pleasing as it signals the arrival of autumn. Recently, our winters have been mild, almost like an extended fall. Our garage is located at the back of the house, so the front door is rarely used unless someone knocks, which is infrequent. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays tend to be quiet, although Thanksgiving and other occasions like Mother's Day and Christmas bring visitors, resulting in extra cars around. Overall, I enjoy living here. If it weren't for the through street, it would be perfect.",
            "I live in a neighborhood situated right in the heart of the high desert, where the landscape is dominated by endless stretches of dirt. It's hard for someone who hasn't lived here to grasp what it's like to constantly see shades of brown. Whenever you spot a green lawn, it's a clear sign that the homeowner is investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s when I first moved here, the houses were few and far between. Although new development has occurred, that aspect hasn't changed much. The area is gradually taking on a more urban appearance, much like other places these days. Generally, the residents are quite welcoming, though, as with any urban area, there are both pleasant and less desirable sections. My neighborhood is filled with amiable elderly folks, making it quite a nice place to live. The local retail scene mostly consists of chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For more upscale shopping, you have to venture further; stores like Whole Foods are nowhere to be found here. Construction seems to be a significant industry in my city, likely because there's still plenty of undeveloped land available for building. This expansion worries me because I appreciate the current state of things. I left a bustling city and am not eager to return to that lifestyle. I'm employed in the construction sector myself, working as a drywall and T-bar installer. One of the aspects I enjoy most about living here is the diverse wildlife. People are drawn to the high desert for its striking beauty. The climate and landscape have produced unique ecosystems that need protection and are home to various creatures. It's important for the human inhabitants to understand and respect these animals to live in harmony. My family has adjusted well to the local wildlife. I have three children who are fascinated by lizards and desert insects; as I write this, they're outside trying to catch different specimens. In terms of attractions, there are a few worth mentioning. Victorville is an excellent destination for families to explore the desert, offering a unique experience. If you visit, try to coincide with the San Bernardino County Fair, which provides an enjoyable mix of activities. Nearby Wrightwood is perfect for seeing snow-covered mountains and taking winter sports lessons. Those interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert should visit the Victor Valley Museum, which houses geological and paleontological exhibits, Native American artifacts, and items that showcase the development of Victorville's society and industry.",
            "When I think about my neighborhood, my perspective might be a little different from the norm. Unlike many others who might think of a traditional neighborhood with homeowners leading separate lives, my situation is quite distinct. My concept of a neighborhood revolves around the college campus where I reside, with the dormitory residents as my community. I also consider the wider campus area to be part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite the uniqueness of my setting, my neighborhood shares several features with conventional neighborhoods. Like any typical neighborhood, mine includes residences, people, stores, and parks. Let's start by looking at the \"houses\" that make up my neighborhood. To begin, it's important to clarify the types of housing found here. There are three main housing types: apartments, standalone houses, and dormitories. In the apartments, you'll typically find 2-4 individuals per room, with about 4-6 rooms on each floor. Most buildings have around two floors, housing approximately 20 people each. Then, there are the standalone houses available for school-affiliated individuals to rent, usually offering 2-4 bedrooms and often inhabited by alumni. These houses are less common due to their inefficiency. Lastly, the dormitories accommodate hundreds of students, generally with two people to a room, making them the most prevalent housing option. With housing described, let's move on to the people. My school values diversity, which is evident in the neighborhood's demographic mix. Individuals from many cultures and age groups live here. Professional staff tend to reside in the standalone houses, newer students in the dormitories, and older students in apartment-style housing. Words alone can't fully capture the essence of the people here, so I'll shift focus to the stores and parks. My school functions as a self-contained neighborhood, offering a variety of stores and a single park. Stores range from dining options that resemble those in any neighborhood to the school's own brand of clothing and grocery outlets. Essentially, anything needed can be found within the neighborhood's limits. Additionally, the park serves as a recreational space for the neighborhood's diverse population, maintained clean and safe by the community members.",
            "In my area, sidewalks are a rarity. The terrain slopes sharply, with my home perched atop the neighborhood's steepest incline. Locals often refer to it as the \"workout hill,\" favored by joggers for their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on my street, pedestrians share the road with vehicles. The pavement has its fair share of potholes, making driving somewhat precarious. Telephone and electric lines crisscross the area, appearing worn and patched due to frequent storms that bring down branches and other debris, necessitating constant repairs. Tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape, but they are unpopular with residents who prefer unobstructed ocean views. This desire leads to homes being constructed high on the hill, featuring large glass-fronted upper floors to capture the bay's scenery. Sunsets here are stunning, as the water glows beneath an orange sky. However, clouds often obscure the sun, casting a hazy light over the area. Overcast, damp days are common, fostering moss growth on roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, requiring hours of cleaning. Children are scarce in my neighborhood, even though a school is nearby. The community largely consists of older, retired individuals who favor dogs over kids. It's not unusual to see dogs lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street, and an open door might invite an unexpected canine visitor inside. Rabbits roam freely, much to the annoyance of gardeners who find their plants uprooted. My cats, however, have managed to reduce their numbers significantly. Birdwatchers can spot sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, though crows often drive them away. There are no shops nearby, but a walk downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The beach is limited, but the rocky shore provides ample entertainment for those who enjoy tossing stones into the bay. The bay is narrow enough to see the opposite shore clearly, mist permitting.",
            "If you're considering a trip to Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, navigating there won't be much of a hassle. The area is well-served by public transit, which is a favored mode of getting around in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban neighborhood, maintaining that quintessential New York City vibe. During your exploration, you'll notice a significant presence of Asian-owned stores, a result of the substantial Asian community that has settled here over the last twenty years. These shops, particularly supermarkets and laundromats, are quite prevalent and popular among locals due to their excellent quality, lower prices, and convenience. Close to my location, for instance, there are four Asian supermarkets within a short two-minute walk from one another, making grocery shopping extremely convenient. However, it's important to note that Bensonhurst isn't solely comprised of Asian residents; it's quite a melting pot, with immigrants and their children from various backgrounds. Many of the prominent businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these establishments, there's also a recently updated park nearby featuring multiple basketball courts, a sizable field for soccer or baseball, several handball courts, swings, a playground, and a refreshing water fountain for children to enjoy during the summer. As you'd expect in New York City, the parks here are vibrant and diverse. People from all walks of life come together to interact and enjoy the facilities. The neighborhood doesn't have many towering corporate buildings; instead, it mostly consists of co-op or condo apartments and primarily two-family houses. The community is generally friendly, albeit a bit on the noisy side. It's common to hear cars with loud music or revving engines passing by, which can be quite the morning wake-up call. If you plan to visit at night, it's wise to stay alert. Although the area is relatively safe, unpredictability is a factor, with occasional troublemakers or petty thieves about. In fact, I've experienced bullying in the past, and package theft has been an issue recently. Despite fines for not picking up after dogs, some residents don't adhere to this rule, resulting in dog waste being a frequent sight on your morning walk to the train or supermarket. It's a personal annoyance of mine, so do watch your step to keep your shoes clean!",
            "To grasp what Portland, Oregon is truly about, one must first understand its unique interpretation of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, emblazoned on a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—often pushing legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s, a time when the city was lesser-known, more affordable, fostering creative subcultures. For others, it’s an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is a compliment. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant rise of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weirdness here doesn't necessarily mean acceptance of everything, but rather a tolerance for what is typically unaccepted. It doesn't imply a lack of modern amenities or issues, either. Like the rest of America, we import most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to defy normalcy, yet Portland has its fair share of the ordinary—yoga, hipsters, and business professionals abound. Perhaps weirdness means taking all of this with a grain of salt. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland areas, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and free boxes in the summer. These boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items people no longer need, yet often seem to contain a little magic—a perfect treasure for the passerby. Often filled with clothes and books, they can surprise with anything. The enchanting possibility of stumbling upon something special while wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood encapsulates the essence of Portland for me. But I represent just one version of weird among countless others. Some locals wouldn't dream of picking their clothes from a sidewalk box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or cheer at Timbers soccer matches. Portland is a city brimming with people chasing diverse passions. It's a place where some of us pursue our dreams, while others dream of pursuing them over a drink at the bar. Yes, Portland faces a drug issue, which often ties back to mental health struggles, exacerbated by the persistent rain and grey skies. The city also grapples with homelessness, a challenge without clear solutions. The homeless are drawn by Portland's relatively better social services, though still insufficient. The non-homeless residents oscillate between compassion and disdain. In this regard, perhaps we aren't so weird after all.",
            "The mountains stand silently, ever-present. To the north, they watch the sun rise and set every day. Regardless of how often I overlook them or become absorbed in the busyness of life, they remain steadfast, indifferent to life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they seem to call out, offering solace and strength when I take a moment to acknowledge them. I first encountered these mountains when I came here for my undergraduate studies, and they immediately caught my attention. While the university itself boasts impressive architecture, tranquil ponds, and lush trees that I hold dear, the mountains hold a special place in my heart. The town itself is charming, with numerous cafés that have seen countless hours of intense study sessions. A short trip downtown reveals a blend of historic charm, with weathered bricks lining restaurants and offices, creating a vibrant atmosphere reminiscent of a bustling city. But this lively vibe only stretches so far before one can retreat to the peacefulness of the quieter parts of town, such as near the library. This close-knit mix of different atmospheres gives the city a magical feel, inviting exploration. It's easy to form treasured memories here, each tied to a specific spot. Whether it's strolling by the old swings in the park after a long night with friends or rushing through downtown to catch a university-sponsored movie at the theater, this place holds both joyful and difficult memories. The ponds, in particular, offer a space for reflection or emotional release during life’s chaotic moments. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives prompted me to ponder my own purpose as I navigated life's uncertainties. Walking past the pond, through the park, and by suburban homes, I eventually reached a main road. At that moment, the sun’s rays lit up the palm trees and painted the sky, revealing that I was heading north. Sure enough, the mountains were there, as always. Their towering presence against the hazy blue and yellow sky was more prominent than any building, and they quietly inspired a renewed sense of resilience within me.",
            "At first look, you might not give it much thought. It's tucked away behind a commercial strip, an unexpected spot for a residential area. One wouldn't typically associate it with desirable living spaces. However, if you venture past the deserted Whole Foods, winding your way beyond the rarely filled hotels that see life only during family reunions each summer, you'll stumble upon a lively neighborhood. On these streets, a series of apartment complexes stand side by side, meticulously arranged like a set of Russian nesting dolls, each carefully separated and aligned along the road. The first set of apartments has gained some notoriety in the news for questionable activities, so let's not dwell on them much—appearances can be misleading, after all. But the neighboring complexes, along with the two adjacent ones, hold a different story that remains largely unknown to local residents. Across from these apartments lies a community college's satellite campus, a tranquil collection of buildings that seem to watch over the road. Students trickle in, coffee in hand, yawning as they begin their early morning classes. The old iron gates creak as they open to let them in, while drivers grumble impatiently at the increased traffic on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehab center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. The rehab facility has inviting porch furniture and a slow-moving ceiling fan that stirs the warm summer air. Kids dash across the grass in the park, tumbling and spinning among the green blades, while bees lazily buzz around the flowerbeds lining the road. Retired folks walk their dogs on the paths, frowning at skateboarding teens and politely acknowledging teenage girls gathered near the playground, chatting about boys and the latest YouTube trends. Nearby, a strip mall hosts a sushi restaurant that serves affordable meals but never seems crowded. Next to it is a swim supply shop and a nail salon nestled between them. It's possible to prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor some hibachi chicken—all at the same place thanks to the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a self-serve frozen yogurt shop, where teens often grab chilled, topping-laden cups as they perform tricks on their skateboards and vape, thinking it's the epitome of cool. This neighborhood is a snapshot of Americana, a slice of history in the unchanging, sleepy South where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood offers a unique blend of characteristics. Most residences are standalone, but there are a few that have been creatively divided into two units while remaining physically connected—if that makes any sense. My house features a modest front yard and a small driveway positioned to its left. Like many others here, it evokes images of an era not too distant when suburban life epitomized the American dream. This dream, once seemingly all-encompassing, now feels somewhat elusive. Nonetheless, my neighborhood and many like it persist, extending an invitation to visitors and residents alike that this dream is still very much alive, though we hold onto it with both challenges and hope. The community's optimism has waned, and the upkeep of the once-pristine lawns reflects this change, yet driveways remain occupied, and children continue to play as if their surroundings comprise their entire world. The local public school, with nearly 90 years of history, still stands, inspiring today's youth and evoking nostalgia among older inhabitants. While churches are sparse and largely unoccupied, the basketball courts remain bustling. Each home exudes its own character but shares a common essence. A large supermarket, Super \"A,\" is run by a Yemeni family, possibly the sole Arab family in the area, amidst a predominantly African American community. The streets are expansive, and children often engage in football games, pausing only for passing vehicles. Many neighborhood residents have deep generational roots here and can recount tales from a time when everyone knew each other. There was a karate studio, but as Hollywood's interest in karate-themed films waned, so did the children's aspirations to emulate the Karate Kid, leading to its conversion into a pharmacy, because, as some say, pharmaceuticals solve everything. Additionally, there's a small cinema showing classic films at reduced rates, underappreciated by the youth for its lack of new releases, yet cherished by older patrons who appreciate the affordable escape from everyday life, sans children. Our town is bisected by an expressway, although the entry and exit ramps lie in the neighboring town. A petition once circulated to secure an exit for our community, supported by the younger generation but opposed by the elders, who believed an expressway would disrupt the town's essence. Ultimately, the elders swayed the city council against it. A new high school is under construction, prompting discussions about a suitable mascot. I propose a cyborg with a Southern drawl and a log cabin as a fitting symbol for our town.",
            "Living in a big city means my neighborhood is incredibly varied. Residential zones mix somewhat haphazardly with commercial districts, home to a range of businesses. These include office spaces, shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's always a new restaurant to try or a store to explore. While there are prominent chain stores owned by major corporations, small boutiques are gaining popularity too. These boutiques are not just in malls; they also line the streets, often within walking distance of otherwise peaceful neighborhoods bustling with attractions. Nearby, there are several parks where families often bring their young children. The neighborhood itself is quite diverse. There's a strong presence of the LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish group, and many refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate neighborhood, the city hosts a multitude of races and ethnicities, sometimes clustered into their own enclaves. We have areas known as Korea Town, China Town, Little Armenia, among others, though they are just a few miles away, traffic can make those miles feel much longer. Driving just 10 miles can take up to two hours during peak traffic times. Most people in my city don't walk much, despite some attractions being nearby, the city's vastness makes walking impractical. Consequently, traffic here is notorious, and finding parking is a challenge. Paradoxically, the city has seen a surge in construction, adding large apartment complexes. This popularity is exciting yet concerning for many residents who worry about increased congestion. Housing varies widely in my city; not everyone wants to live in a large apartment building. There are diverse housing options, including single-family homes, duplexes, and smaller apartments and condos. This diversity extends to the people living here, who are of all ages. Truthfully, I'm not familiar with most of my neighbors, as it's not a close-knit community today. However, I cherish childhood memories of playing with my next-door neighbor and friends from the neighborhood.",
            "As we drove by the endless stretch of cornfields, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" aware of how the vast openness would surprise her. Coming from a place where the grocery store was just a short walk away, she'd never encountered such expansive rural scenery. I explained to her what it was like growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she understood a part of me and my roots. On the narrow country road leading to my neighborhood, there's a water-filled quarry. Beyond it, the small community where I reside comes into view. The homes are primarily crafted from brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre of land, which everyone takes pride in maintaining. Spring brings an array of vibrant flowers and the sight of midwestern trees changing with the seasons. Driveways are adorned with gleaming luxury cars, especially Mercedes Benz, shining after a thorough wash. As we approach my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor is always outside, welcoming with a warm smile. He spends his days meticulously mowing his lawn, his voice rising above the mower's hum. He's a source of amusement in the neighborhood, yet always sincere and fascinating, with a remarkable past. Once a respected doctor, he now blends into the background with his trusty mower. Finally, we arrive at my home. In the side yard, geese roam freely, playfully chased by our Terrier. Behind the house, a gentle stream flows into the quarry, accompanied by bullfrogs' croaks and distant farm noises. Across a handmade wooden bridge lies a pristine sanctuary filled with natural trees, herbs, and wildflowers. This place was my childhood playground, where I built tree forts and engaged in playful 'hunting' with friends. Despite harsh winters, the landscape's beauty is unparalleled. The yard transforms from lush greenery to a stark wilderness. The once colorful trees become bare and skeletal. When snow graces the ground, a magical wonderland emerges. Snow angels crafted by my sister and snowmen dot the yard. We often quarreled, but during winter, snowball fights were our battles of choice. We constructed forts resembling igloos to store our snowy arsenal, using branches for protection. In this enchanted setting, we played, lost in our imaginations, carefree and innocent."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in a rural part of America, specifically in a small town located in Michigan. Here, the landscape transitions seamlessly from expansive farmland to quaint tourist destinations. You won't find large shopping malls or chain stores like Walmart, Target, or Applebee's. To reach any destination, driving is a necessity. Despite this, I consider my home to be among the most stunning places globally, thanks to its proximity to water. My town is nestled between the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are abundant and easily accessible for anyone wishing to enjoy a leisurely day by the water.\n\nThe neighborhood I call home epitomizes the essence of small-town living. Houses are not crammed together nor are they identical in design. Many are older structures, some undergoing renovations, while others retain their vintage charm. Most houses feature full basements visible from the street, and you’ll notice that many have traditional aluminum siding. The homes in my area showcase a variety of colors, creating a vibrant community atmosphere. Yards are common, often adorned with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. This neighborhood mirrors Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or already have.\n\nThe streets are lively, with children playing and people engaging in activities like walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar with one another, easily identifying residents and newcomers. It’s typical to see someone grilling and exchange a friendly wave, or encounter a dog walker from a few blocks away and share a smile. Lawns are well-maintained; there are no remnants of autumn leaves cluttering the yards, and the grass is kept neatly trimmed. While the neighborhood may not boast stunning architecture, it exudes a warm, inviting aura, ideal for family life. It is a serene, safe, and peaceful community. \n\nWithin a short stroll, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, with the health department conveniently next door. The city’s recycling center is also nearby, serving both local residents and those from surrounding areas. Close by are baseball and softball fields where the lively sounds of games in progress fill the air. Adjacent to these fields is our modest town airport, where the hum of small aircraft is a familiar backdrop to daily life. A local ice cream shop provides a delightful treat, and downtown is within reachable distance from our neighborhood. My children can easily bike to a park just eight blocks away. Indeed, it's a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The area where I reside can be best described as a classic suburban environment. Specifically, in my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice rows of well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association's efforts. The front yards are mostly uniform: small sections of landscaped grass, decorative stones, and short driveways, with an occasional small tree. Every house features a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads. Despite the variety of families living here, the streets remain in excellent condition with no potholes in sight. Most homes are single-story, though there are some two-story houses too. Our mailbox setup is unique for single-family homes; instead of individual mailboxes, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to apartments. Residents use keys to access their specific mailboxes, and there are larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another hallmark of the HOA's influence. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, giving the neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban characteristics. This location provides ample space for various amenities. There are several community pools, accessible to all residents, that are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are walking trails for leisurely strolls or dog walks, eliminating the need to visit a park for exercise. The neighborhood is spacious enough for a substantial run. The community is primarily composed of retirees, making it a safe area where neighbors look out for each other, though there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large population-wise but maintains a small-town feel. It offers a wide range of amenities. For example, we have one mall; it's not enormous, but it serves its purpose. A 15-minute drive gets me to various significant locations with different stores to choose from. We have everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to discount outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical, with attractive features like pools and walking trails. Shopping isn't immediately nearby, but a short drive connects us to major chains.",
            "I first learned about my neighborhood while listening to a podcast discussing missing persons. The information caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment nearby costs over a thousand dollars monthly. My friends and I had never heard of that case before. Perhaps it’s the struggle that resonates. Several of my friends often find themselves shedding tears at night. Life is costly, but over time we've mastered frugality. The scent of dusty flea market toys and clothes stored with mothballs becomes familiar. As an adult, you notice smells less frequently. You might take up smoking or simply get used to how things are. Yet, the flea market fragrance is unmistakable. The aroma of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering in leather even after cleaning. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people crowding the streets each morning, yet the thrift stores remain serene. Regardless of the traffic outside, the shops are tranquil. It’s an ideal spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, the influx of people and cars grows. The city is evolving, they claim. It hosts one of the major e-commerce and delivery giants, yet it still experiences growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, with little demanded of you. You can be solitary, reserved, and self-reliant, and others will respect your space. It's different from the South, where showing concern is a sign of caring. Here, personal boundaries are respected. You can maintain your privacy as long as you wish, while the city ebbs and flows like the ocean waves. It’s a vibrant environment. With a pianist next door and two aspiring singers upstairs, there’s always activity. In a sense, our building is less a collection of strangers and more a community of friends. We unite for support, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and assist each other when possible. I feel fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail, and I enjoy seeing them, believing they appreciate my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a vast, impersonal modern complex, it's the people like my neighbors who make me feel that my life choices weren't entirely misguided.",
            "I reside in a modest town in the Midwest, situated just beyond the suburban edge of a large city. My neighborhood, located on the eastern side, is often considered one of the town's less affluent sections. The housing market here is quite affordable, with many properties either rented out or owned by individuals with lower incomes. Nonetheless, it remains a pleasant and welcoming place. My neighbors are generally amiable, often greeting me with a smile and a hello when I'm out for a walk. Although crime rates are somewhat higher compared to other areas of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, a few blocks from my home have witnessed some violent incidents, including shootings and at least one murder. Tragically, our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has only had minor experiences with crime, such as the occasional item going missing from our porch when we forget to bring it inside. This town has been significantly impacted by the opioid crisis affecting many regions across the United States, and fentanyl overdoses have claimed numerous lives. Fortunately, our community offers various resources to address this issue, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training for those supporting individuals struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts several positive features. My son attends an elementary school with exceptional staff, ranging from the principal to the teachers and support team. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered bullying, thanks to the school's supportive environment, and he thoroughly enjoys it there. Our active parent-teacher organization organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family participation and academic growth. With over 20% of our town's residents living below the poverty line, the elementary school provides complimentary breakfast and lunch to ensure no child goes hungry. No family is treated differently due to financial constraints, and school-related expenses are kept affordable. The City Council and staff have made significant strides in enhancing the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, most of these efforts are concentrated in the town center and the western side, where shopping areas and traffic are prevalent. The eastern side, where I live, often feels overlooked, which is a source of frustration for my neighbors. Overall, I genuinely enjoy living here. The community is friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs. Our home, while not highly valued, is comfortable and suits us well. We've been part of this town for over 16 years and can hardly envision living elsewhere.",
            "In my neighborhood, culture thrives in every corner. Perched on a hill, it's encircled by historically significant structures. My residence is a seven-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block further down the hill, there's a unique arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd, especially on warm summer nights. During June and July weekends, it's common to see a line of people outside, eagerly waiting to enter. A few blocks up lies the city's nearest park, surprisingly large for its urban location. The park is enclosed by concrete walls with tall stairs leading down. In the cold winter months, homeless individuals often set up their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. Although snow is rare, the heavy mid-winter rains make staying warm a challenge. By clustering their tents close in the city center, rather than the outskirts, they can better fend off the chill. Moreover, they remain within a reasonable distance to the only family center in miles where they can access bathing facilities. What I cherish most about my city isn't its historic beauty—the grand buildings and the eclectic architecture that cascades down the hills to the ocean. It's the vibrant culture of the people. Hilltop, once infamous for gang violence on the West Coast, still echoes with stories from that era. Even now, three decades later, tales of federal raids and the DEA's attempts to clean the streets are shared. The community remembers. Stories are passed down, reaching newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the city's tougher areas, residents strive to maintain and improve it. They care deeply about their surroundings. There's a lingering caution—people say it's unsafe for a white person to walk Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, shaped by outdated social norms. Perhaps my ambiguous appearance helps me blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone attuned to the enduring issues of racism and ignorance, even in a city celebrated for its diversity. Regardless of how far I wander, Hilltop remains my home. Walking those streets at night invigorates me, meeting people more inclined to offer a jacket than harm. It's a place where laundromat owners extend their hours so I can charge my phone when there's no refuge from the rain. It's where I've sat, believing myself unseen, only to have a stranger acknowledge me, offer five dollars, and affirm my worth and beauty.",
            "I relocated to this area right before starting eighth grade, and initially, it was challenging for me to form friendships. Eventually, I became close with a neighbor living two doors down and another person on my street. Although they both have since moved away, the memories remain vivid. Most of the residents who were here when I arrived have stayed. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area, characterized by numerous two-story houses. On weekends or whenever the weather is pleasant, the sounds of children playing outdoors fill the air. The neighborhood maintains a quiet atmosphere most of the time. I've never had any issues with the residents here. People generally respect your privacy unless assistance is needed. I've ordered several packages online, and they've always been safely delivered without any theft. I have a sense of trust in my neighbors. A park is located just a minute or two from my house, holding many memories for me. I've played various sports like basketball, football, and baseball there with friends. One of my worst memories also happened there, involving a football accident where I got elbowed in the nose, but the positive memories far outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, my visits to the park are mainly to spend time with my cousin's children, who are much younger and still enjoy activities like swings and slides. Just the thought of going to the park excites them. The park evokes a strong sense of nostalgia for me for various reasons. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a wide range of cuisines. Within a mile, one can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people now opt for food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food is particularly popular, as it is in most suburban areas, and there are plenty of pizza places. The local stores provide everything one might need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores reflect the area's diversity, like an Indian-owned shop for those interested in either homemade or ready-made Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about and seeing reports of the difficulties others face with their neighbors makes me thankful for the community I have.",
            "I live in a neighborhood that’s conveniently close to my college, which makes it quite enjoyable for me. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, but there are also some restaurants and bars that offer a fun time without being too pricey. One bar recently changed its name and, while it's more costly, the quality isn't too bad. The community is generally friendly, consisting mainly of college students and individuals with lower incomes due to the affordability of the apartments. An elementary school nearby means there are many children around. Although I don’t know my neighbors well, I’m not particularly interested in doing so. They tend to smoke a lot, so the building management installed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not slightly offensive. The buildings in my vicinity often appear old but might have updated interiors. Further down the street are some newly constructed apartments that I dislike because of their poor-quality building work, despite the high rent, which seems unfair. However, their proximity to campus allows management to charge more. Nearby, there is an inexpensive restaurant that serves food on paper plates, mostly prepared in a microwave. Across from it is a gas station reputed to be a difficult place to work. Last summer, the city funded a road renovation, resulting in a new wide sidewalk and plenty of greenery, making the area more appealing. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, although some have been cut down, leaving stumps. There are more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line leading to another set of apartments. I reside on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, right behind, is less appealing. Its sidewalks are in disrepair, and the buildings look run-down. Trees on this street might be there to conceal the buildings' appearance. Most crime in the area occurs at a complex on that street, but I can’t entirely attribute the issue to them, as there are also apartments across from me with significant crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like my residence. It’s affordable, with lots of useful amenities nearby. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops that make it easy to reach the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, you'll find duplexes neatly arranged along a cul-de-sac. They're spaced in a way that gives the impression of standalone homes, each uniquely painted in yellow with charming white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly and often gather casually at the end of a driveway in the evenings, exchanging small talk while the neighborhood kids indulge in their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It feels like a refreshing escape from the high-tech, fast-paced modern world, almost as if we've stepped into a different era. The area is enveloped by fields and trees, accentuated by blue skies and fluffy white clouds. \n\nHowever, this season has brought tornado warnings, and just last night, the sirens blared for the first time, sending us seeking cover. I ended up in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, was too anxious to join us and stayed in the living room, barking nervously at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was eerily silent except for the sound of large hailstones striking the ground. After the storm passed, the road seemed to steam due to the rapid temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail quickly melted upon hitting the hot pavement. As I looked up at the clearing sky, the sun emerged and it began to rain, revealing a stunning double rainbow. Eager to capture the moment, I hurried inside to fetch my camera and snapped photos to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the storm had hit. Then, life resumed its normal rhythm, with moms and kids outside while dinner was being prepared. \n\nThis friendly neighborhood has been a wonderful change for me since moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the charming southern accents here. My apartment, like all others, has two bedrooms and two bathrooms, yet despite the uniform exterior, not all the apartments are identical inside; some are surprisingly compact, which baffles me. I enjoy taking leisurely walks across the expansive field behind my home and wandering down to the pond, which isn’t suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer and can often hear the giant bullfrog crooning in the mornings. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the crowing of roosters from nearby farms, making it feel like living in a quaint, self-contained village. We even have a donkey on a neighboring farm whose braying in the evening reminds us of his presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for close to a decade, I feel I've gathered enough experiences to share. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was quite emotional for me. I left behind people I cherished, and adjusting was tough—I even shed some tears. However, my parents were determined to provide the best opportunities for my sister and me, which meant relocating to a neighborhood with better housing and educational prospects. Over time, I adapted, making both friends and a few adversaries during my school years. My interactions with neighbors were limited, save for Mr. Glen, his kids, and Dennis, who lived nearby. They became almost like family to me, and I hold them in high regard. A memorable occasion was attending Mr. Glen’s remarriage ceremony with my family. It was a joyful event, and I aspire to create similar happiness in my future. I even caught the garter Ms. Veda tossed, though I missed the bouquet. The evening was filled with dancing, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, whom I haven't seen since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood can be confusing, but with GPS, I've been able to explore more extensively, especially with friends like Kason and Curtis. We spent countless hours gaming and making the most of our time. Occasionally, I visit the park to connect with nature, which brings me tranquility. I enjoy practicing balance with sticks from the hardware store and wielding my bokken. There are also courts for basketball and tennis, though I haven't played in a while. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, pushing us hard, yet ensuring we had a blast. Reflecting on these experiences, I'm grateful for the fun I've had here, and I remain optimistic that the future holds even more joy.",
            "My hometown is a charming little spot that doesn't particularly shine among the others in South Carolina, yet it plays a crucial role in the agriculture sector. Johnston has earned the title of the Peach Capital of the World, a claim proudly displayed on its welcome sign. The area is largely made up of farmland, primarily featuring peach orchards or cattle pastures. Homes outside the town center are spaced far apart, often two stories high with either metal roofs designed to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Typically, these homes are set back from the road to make room for fields in front, used for crops or livestock. In the heart of town, a single traffic light governs a four-way intersection, where the only stores in town are located. For quick meals, there are just three options: Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once operated here but has since closed. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is humorously more famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola than its medical supplies. IGA, a small yet pricey grocery store, is the sole place for food shopping, though most people prefer traveling to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their primary grocery needs. The most frequented store in town is Dollar General, where a wide variety of everyday items is sold, bustling from opening to closing. Possibilities Furniture & More, a quaint furniture shop run by a beloved local, has been a fixture in Johnston for years, even offering delivery services with their two movers. Attached to this building is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service providing everything from daycare to nail trimming. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic are located outside the town's core, small but well-equipped to serve the community. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only school. After finishing fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in a neighboring town. Technically, there are no parks, but plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational space to offer families more activities and draw in visitors or new residents. While the town lacks amenities like movie theaters, bowling alleys, social spots, children's playgrounds, walking areas for pets, or diverse dining options, it remains a pleasant, albeit tiny place that could be missed if you blink as you pass by!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a quaint southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, resulting in a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I'm quite familiar with most of the residents. Generally, people occupy themselves with yard work and daily chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of the street, giving us a view of everyone coming and going throughout the day, making us familiar with the cars in the area. When an unfamiliar vehicle appears, we often take notice. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes, engaging in all the usual activities you'd expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from here. There are four of us: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. So, I believe others are accustomed to our comings and goings too. We enjoy playing outside, even in the rain sometimes. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, and the aroma is always delightful. It seems someone is always mowing their lawn, and the sound of a lawn mower is a regular presence from March until about October, when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood, originally a wooded area, has many trees providing ample shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, requiring annual raking and burning. I enjoy the scent of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winter hasn't been significant, making it feel like an extended fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which isn't often. I occasionally work on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are usually quiet, except during Thanksgiving when families host visitors from out of town, leading to extra cars parked around. Similar patterns occur during other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here, and if it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "Located right in the heart of the high desert, my neighborhood is surrounded by endless stretches of dirt. For those who haven't lived here, it's hard to grasp the constant presence of brown hues, and spotting a lawn is a clear indication of someone investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s, when I first moved here, homes were scattered with considerable distance between them. While this remains relatively unchanged, numerous new constructions have appeared. Frankly, this area is increasingly resembling a city, but I suppose that’s a common trend in many places. Generally, the locals are quite amicable, though, like any urban area, it has its ups and downs. The elderly folks around me are particularly friendly, suggesting it’s a pleasant neighborhood. The retail scene is dominated by chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For more upscale shopping, one must venture out, as Whole Foods and similar stores are rare here. Construction seems to be the leading industry in my city, based on my observations rather than official data. This likely stems from the city’s ongoing development, with plenty of open land still available for building. The thought of further expansion is somewhat unsettling for me, as I prefer the current state of things. Having left a large city, I'm reluctant to return to that lifestyle. My full-time job is in construction, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. One aspect I love about living here is the diverse wildlife. Many are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty. The unique climate and terrain create ecosystems worthy of protection, housing various wildlife species. It's essential for the human residents to acquaint themselves with these non-human inhabitants to ensure peaceful coexistence. My family and I have adapted well to living alongside wildlife. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects, and as I write this, they are outside attempting to capture different samples. As for local attractions, there are a few. Victorville offers families a chance to experience the desert’s distinct charm. If possible, plan your visit around the San Bernardino County Fair for a truly enriching experience. You might also want to visit Wrightwood to enjoy snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert? The Victor Valley Museum showcases geological and paleontological samples, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate Victorville’s societal and industrial development.",
            "When considering how to describe my neighborhood, my perspective might be a bit unconventional. Unlike many who might define their neighborhood in terms of homeownership and distinct personal lives, my experience is a little different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the dormitory community as my closest circle. I also include the broader campus in my neighborhood concept, though to a lesser extent. Despite this unusual take, my neighborhood bears similarities to traditional ones. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine has residences, people, shops, and green spaces. Let's start by discussing the \"residences\" that make up my neighborhood. It’s helpful to clarify the types of housing found here. In my immediate area, there are three categories: apartments, traditional houses, and dormitories. First, the apartments usually accommodate 2-4 people per room, with about 4-6 rooms per floor. With most buildings having two floors, around 20 people live in each. Next, there are the actual houses available for school-affiliated individuals, typically with 2-4 bedrooms and often occupied by alumni. However, these houses are less common due to their inefficiency. Lastly, the dormitories house hundreds of students, with most rooms shared by two people, making it the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. Now that housing is discussed, let's move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, and this is mirrored in my neighborhood. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Professional staff typically reside in the neighborhood houses, while new students stay in dormitories, and older students often choose apartment-style living. Describing the people here doesn't do them justice, so let’s proceed to the stores and parks. My school, essentially a self-contained neighborhood, is home to numerous stores and one park. The stores offer a mix of dining options found in any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery outlets. This means everything needed is accessible within my neighborhood. Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the diverse community, maintained in a clean and safe condition by neighborhood members!",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are a rare sight. My house is perched at the top of the steepest hill in the area, which has earned the nickname \"work out hill\" because joggers frequently tackle it during their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on our street, everyone ends up walking on the road. The road itself is quite uneven, with several potholes that make driving a bit risky. Around the block, the telephone and electric wires have a rather worn-out appearance. Our region experiences frequent rain and storms, causing branches and debris to often knock out power lines, resulting in a patched-up, makeshift look. \n\nEverywhere you look, tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape. However, the locals aren't fond of them, as they block the ocean view. Consequently, many houses are constructed high on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories, offering a panoramic view of the bay. The sunsets are stunning, painting the water with a glowing hue and turning the sky orange. Yet, most days are characterized by a cloudy, overcast sky, with sunlight breaking through only in a haze. The persistent dampness encourages moss to grow on surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, taking me three hours to clean. \n\nThe neighborhood has few children, despite a school just a few blocks away, as it's mostly populated by older, retired individuals. Instead of children, the area is teeming with dogs, frequently seen lounging on lawns or racing down the street. Leaving a door or window open means risking an unexpected canine visitor, like the one I once discovered in my living room and had to escort outside. Rabbits roam freely, much to the dismay of gardeners who find their plants uprooted and lawns burrowed into. My cats enjoy hunting them, and they've significantly reduced their numbers in our vicinity. Birdlife is abundant, with sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, although the local crows usually drive them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but a downhill trek to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. While there's not much of a beach, the rocky shore is perfect for tossing stones into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, allowing for a clear view of the opposite shore, even on misty days.",
            "When you decide to explore Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll discover it's quite easy to reach! The public transit system is widely accessible and remains a favored mode of travel in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban area, maintaining the quintessential New York City atmosphere. During your visit, expect to encounter numerous Asian shops throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll notice an Asian-owned shop practically on every street corner. Among the most frequented are supermarkets and laundromats. These establishments are especially popular with locals due to their excellent food quality, competitive pricing, and overall convenience. In fact, there are four Asian supermarkets located within a short two-minute walk from where I am. This ease of access to groceries is a notable convenience. However, Bensonhurst is not exclusively populated by Asian residents; it is quite diverse, with a mix of immigrants and both first- and second-generation Americans. Many of the significant local businesses are Asian-owned, yet the area also boasts a newly refurbished park nearby. This park features about ten basketball courts, a spacious field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and even a fountain for summertime fun. Naturally, being in New York City, the parks reflect the city's diverse population, fostering an environment where people of various backgrounds can enjoy activities together. In this neighborhood, you won't find many towering corporate buildings. Instead, you'll encounter co-op or condominium apartments, with most residences consisting of two-family homes. The community is generally friendly, albeit quite lively. Expect to hear cars passing by with loud music or engines revving, which can be a morning wake-up call. If you visit at night, it's wise to remain cautious. The area is relatively safe, but unpredictability can be an issue, with potential encounters with troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. Personally, I've experienced bullying in this neighborhood through physical altercations in the past, although this was years ago. There have also been instances of package theft—an unfortunately common occurrence here. Lastly, despite regulations in New York City requiring pet owners to clean up after their dogs, compliance is lacking. You’ll likely come across dog waste on your journey to the train station or the supermarket each morning. This is one of my biggest frustrations about the area; so, watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "When you think about Portland, Oregon, the concept of \"weird\" is key. The city’s unofficial motto, painted on the side of a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes pushing legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this phrase evokes memories of Portland in the '90s and early 2000s, a time when it was less famous and expensive, fostering vibrant and distinct subcultures. For others, it’s an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is now a compliment. Even with the arrival of affluent Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weirdness here doesn’t always mean acceptance, but it does imply acceptance of what is typically not accepted. Being weird doesn’t preclude having modern amenities and challenges. Like the rest of America, we purchase most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird or different, yet Portland has its share of the ordinary. There are yoga classes, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps being weird means not taking these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others in Portland, you’ll find vibrant homes, gardens growing flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes in the summer. These free boxes, usually cardboard or sometimes plastic, offer items someone no longer needs. Often, they hold a little magic—a treasure perfect for the passerby. Typically containing clothes and books, they can hold anything. This enchanting potential of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what defines Portland for me, though I’m just one among many types of weird. Some locals wouldn’t consider picking their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer games. Portland is a city of diverse passions. It’s filled with people chasing our dreams or dreaming of chasing them while spending too much time at the bar. Admittedly, Portland struggles with drug issues. These often stem from mental health problems, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Homelessness is another challenge, with no clear solutions in sight. The city’s homeless are attracted by the social services, which are better than many other places, yet still inadequate. The residents’ attitudes towards the homeless swing between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we are not unique.",
            "The mountains stand constant, watching over the sun's path each morning and evening. Regardless of how often I overlook them, absorbed in the chaos of work and life, they remain steadfast, untouched by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they compel my attention, offering solace and strength to continue, step by step. When I began my undergraduate studies, these northern mountains were what initially caught my attention. Although the university boasts stunning architecture, tranquil ponds, and towering trees, which hold a special place in my heart, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme. The town itself is charming, filled with cozy cafés that served as my study sanctuaries, fueled by caffeine. A short walk or bus ride brings you to downtown, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings exude a historic charm, making this suburban town seem as lively as its urban neighbor. Yet, escape is easy; just pass the library and return to a quieter ambiance. This blend of contrasting atmospheres invites exploration and fosters countless cherished memories tied to different town locales. Whether it's strolling past the park's weathered swings with friends after a sleepless night or racing through the bustling downtown to catch a university-sponsored movie at the upscale theater. Of course, like any place, it also harbors painful memories. The ponds, in particular, are ideal for introspection or midnight cries during existential crises—an experience I'm all too familiar with. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each playing a part, often made me question my own purpose during my journey through life's uncertainties. So, I would wander past the pond, the park, and the quintessential suburban houses, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees and painted the sky. As I looked up at the dawn, I realized I was heading north. There they were, as always. The towering mountains, more imposing than any building, touched the hazy blue and yellow sky, silently reigniting my determination.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it. Situated behind a commercial area, it's not the kind of location where you'd expect to find residential housing, or at least not homes that are particularly appealing. But if you venture beyond the deserted Whole Foods and bypass the hotels that only see guests during summer family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. In these neighborhoods, the streets are lined with a series of apartment complexes nestled together like meticulously arranged Russian nesting dolls, each one positioned thoughtfully in a row down the street. The initial set of apartments has gained some notoriety due to unsavory incidents covered by the media, so we'll steer clear of dwelling on those—they remind us that looks can be deceiving. However, the adjacent complexes offer a glimpse into a different world, largely unknown to the locals. Across the street from these complexes is a satellite campus of a community college—a tranquil collection of buildings that quietly watch over the road. Students, clutching coffee and still shaking off sleep, trickle in at 7 a.m. for the start of their day. The creaky iron gates swing open to welcome them, while commuters lament their presence for causing traffic delays on days of high attendance. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people recovering from unfortunate injuries on the other. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a slowly rotating ceiling fan that stirs the warm, heavy summer air. Children dart across the park's grassy expanse, turning cartwheels and somersaults through the sharp green blades, as bees hover lazily among the roadside flowers. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, casting disapproving glances at skateboarding teenagers while politely acknowledging the teenage girls gathered at the playground, chatting about boys and the latest online trends. Nearby, there's a sushi restaurant in a strip mall next to the park, offering affordable meals yet rarely crowded—a swim shop sits adjacent, with a nail salon nestled in between. Here, you could simultaneously prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, frequently visited by teens from the park, who clutch their chilled, sweating cups of yogurt topped with an assortment of treats as they practice skateboard tricks and vape to impress their peers. This neighborhood represents a slice of Americana—a snapshot of history in the tranquil South, where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood has a unique charm. Most residences are single-family houses, though a few have been cleverly divided into two, maintaining their connectedness, if that makes any sense. My own house features a modest yard at the front and a small driveway on the left side. The area, much like many others, evokes memories of a not-so-distant past when suburban living epitomized the American dream. While this dream once warmly embraced the nation, it now seems to be slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood, like many others, persists and beckons both residents and visitors, suggesting that the dream endures, and we cling to it as best we can. The residents may not be as optimistic as before; the once meticulously kept yards aren't as pristine, but cars still fill the driveways, and children still play, seeing their surroundings as their whole world. The local public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking fond memories among the older generation. Churches are sparse and often empty, yet the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has its distinct appearance but shares a familiar essence. A large supermarket named Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family who are likely the only Arab family in the area, serves the community. Most residents are African American. The streets are broad, and children often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many neighborhood families have lived here for generations, sharing stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but interest waned when Hollywood stopped producing Karate Kid movies, so it became a pharmacy—because, as they say, medicine solves everything. A small movie theater shows classic films at a discount, overlooked by the younger crowd due to its lack of new releases but cherished by older patrons who appreciate an affordable night out without kids. A single freeway runs through town, though its exits and entrances are located in the neighboring town. A petition once sought to add an exit for our town. The youth championed it, but the elders opposed it, arguing an exit would spoil our town, and they succeeded in convincing the city council to reject the request. A new high school is under construction, and we are debating a mascot for our town. I believe a cyborg with a Southern accent and a log cabin would perfectly capture the spirit of our community.",
            "Living in a bustling city, my neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity. Residential zones blend seamlessly with commercial areas, hosting an array of businesses. Some are office spaces, while others are shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's a constant stream of new restaurants to try and stores to explore. We have both large, recognizable chain stores and small, trendy boutiques. These boutiques aren't confined to malls; they also line the streets, often just a short stroll from neighborhoods that would be peaceful if not for the myriad attractions. Nearby parks offer a retreat, and they're popular spots for families with children. The neighborhood itself is a melting pot, with a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish population, and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate area, the city hosts a wider range of ethnic communities, like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, all within a few miles but often a lengthy drive due to the notorious traffic. Despite the city's size, walking isn't the favored mode of transport, leading to some of the worst traffic congestion globally and challenging parking situations. Interestingly, there's been a surge in construction, with large apartment complexes springing up, attracting more residents—and adding to the traffic woes. Housing options are varied, from sprawling houses to smaller apartments and condos. Single-family homes and duplexes coexist even in my own neighborhood, reflecting the diversity of living spaces. The community is intergenerational, though I must admit I don't know many of my neighbors. It's not the cohesive community it once was, but I fondly recall childhood days spent playing outside with my next-door neighbor and friends of similar age.",
            "As we drove by the expansive cornfields stretching out to the horizon, she turned to me and asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied with a chuckle, \"This is it!\" Her surprise was palpable, accustomed as she was to a town where a grocery store was just a short stroll from her home. She had never encountered such vast open spaces. As she took in the seemingly endless cornfields, I began to share the story of my upbringing in rural Ohio, a place that shaped who I am. \n\nNavigating the narrow country road, we eventually passed a water-filled quarry before arriving at my neighborhood. The houses here, mostly made of brick and stucco, each sit on a generous half-acre of land. Residents take pride in their gardens, which burst with flowers every spring, complemented by the ever-changing hues of Midwest trees. Driveways gleam with luxury Mercedes Benz cars, freshly washed and shining brilliantly in the midday sun.\n\nAs we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was outside, as usual, with a welcoming smile. He spends his days meticulously mowing his lawn and is known for singing over the sound of his mower. His jovial nature endears him to everyone, though age has mellowed some of his sharpness. He once practiced medicine and now blends seamlessly into his surroundings with his John Deere mower.\n\nUpon reaching my home, we find the side yard teeming with geese, playfully chased by our Terrier. In the back, a small stream meanders into the quarry, its gentle sounds mingling with the calls of bullfrogs and the distant \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched retreat, a haven of wild trees, herbs, and flowers. This was my childhood playground, where tree forts were constructed, and 'hunting' adventures took place, often involving nothing more than chasing after animals. There was always a neighborhood kid around for companionship.\n\nThe winters here can be harsh, yet they unveil a unique beauty. The green landscape turns into a stark wilderness, with once-vibrant trees becoming skeletal forms. When snow graces the ground, a winter wonderland emerges as if by magic. The backyard becomes a canvas for snow angels created by my little sister, alongside snowmen we built together. Our childhood clashes often erupted into snowball fights, with forts constructed from branches serving as our armories. In this wintry paradise, we played make-believe, lost in a world where nothing else mattered. We were simply children, carefree and full of imagination."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in a rural part of America, specifically in a small town located in Michigan. Here, the landscape transitions seamlessly from expansive farmland to quaint tourist destinations. You won't find large shopping malls or chain stores like Walmart, Target, or Applebee's. To reach any destination, driving is a necessity. Despite this, I consider my home to be among the most stunning places globally, thanks to its proximity to water. My town is nestled between the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are abundant and easily accessible for anyone wishing to enjoy a leisurely day by the water.\n\nThe neighborhood I call home epitomizes the essence of small-town living. Houses are not crammed together nor are they identical in design. Many are older structures, some undergoing renovations, while others retain their vintage charm. Most houses feature full basements visible from the street, and you’ll notice that many have traditional aluminum siding. The homes in my area showcase a variety of colors, creating a vibrant community atmosphere. Yards are common, often adorned with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. This neighborhood mirrors Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or already have.\n\nThe streets are lively, with children playing and people engaging in activities like walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar with one another, easily identifying residents and newcomers. It’s typical to see someone grilling and exchange a friendly wave, or encounter a dog walker from a few blocks away and share a smile. Lawns are well-maintained; there are no remnants of autumn leaves cluttering the yards, and the grass is kept neatly trimmed. While the neighborhood may not boast stunning architecture, it exudes a warm, inviting aura, ideal for family life. It is a serene, safe, and peaceful community. \n\nWithin a short stroll, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, with the health department conveniently next door. The city’s recycling center is also nearby, serving both local residents and those from surrounding areas. Close by are baseball and softball fields where the lively sounds of games in progress fill the air. Adjacent to these fields is our modest town airport, where the hum of small aircraft is a familiar backdrop to daily life. A local ice cream shop provides a delightful treat, and downtown is within reachable distance from our neighborhood. My children can easily bike to a park just eight blocks away. Indeed, it's a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The area where I reside can be best described as a classic suburban environment. Specifically, in my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice rows of well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association's efforts. The front yards are mostly uniform: small sections of landscaped grass, decorative stones, and short driveways, with an occasional small tree. Every house features a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads. Despite the variety of families living here, the streets remain in excellent condition with no potholes in sight. Most homes are single-story, though there are some two-story houses too. Our mailbox setup is unique for single-family homes; instead of individual mailboxes, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to apartments. Residents use keys to access their specific mailboxes, and there are larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another hallmark of the HOA's influence. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, giving the neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban characteristics. This location provides ample space for various amenities. There are several community pools, accessible to all residents, that are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are walking trails for leisurely strolls or dog walks, eliminating the need to visit a park for exercise. The neighborhood is spacious enough for a substantial run. The community is primarily composed of retirees, making it a safe area where neighbors look out for each other, though there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large population-wise but maintains a small-town feel. It offers a wide range of amenities. For example, we have one mall; it's not enormous, but it serves its purpose. A 15-minute drive gets me to various significant locations with different stores to choose from. We have everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to discount outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical, with attractive features like pools and walking trails. Shopping isn't immediately nearby, but a short drive connects us to major chains.",
            "I first learned about my neighborhood while listening to a podcast discussing missing persons. The information caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment nearby costs over a thousand dollars monthly. My friends and I had never heard of that case before. Perhaps it’s the struggle that resonates. Several of my friends often find themselves shedding tears at night. Life is costly, but over time we've mastered frugality. The scent of dusty flea market toys and clothes stored with mothballs becomes familiar. As an adult, you notice smells less frequently. You might take up smoking or simply get used to how things are. Yet, the flea market fragrance is unmistakable. The aroma of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering in leather even after cleaning. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people crowding the streets each morning, yet the thrift stores remain serene. Regardless of the traffic outside, the shops are tranquil. It’s an ideal spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, the influx of people and cars grows. The city is evolving, they claim. It hosts one of the major e-commerce and delivery giants, yet it still experiences growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, with little demanded of you. You can be solitary, reserved, and self-reliant, and others will respect your space. It's different from the South, where showing concern is a sign of caring. Here, personal boundaries are respected. You can maintain your privacy as long as you wish, while the city ebbs and flows like the ocean waves. It’s a vibrant environment. With a pianist next door and two aspiring singers upstairs, there’s always activity. In a sense, our building is less a collection of strangers and more a community of friends. We unite for support, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and assist each other when possible. I feel fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail, and I enjoy seeing them, believing they appreciate my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a vast, impersonal modern complex, it's the people like my neighbors who make me feel that my life choices weren't entirely misguided.",
            "I reside in a modest town in the Midwest, situated just beyond the suburban edge of a large city. My neighborhood, located on the eastern side, is often considered one of the town's less affluent sections. The housing market here is quite affordable, with many properties either rented out or owned by individuals with lower incomes. Nonetheless, it remains a pleasant and welcoming place. My neighbors are generally amiable, often greeting me with a smile and a hello when I'm out for a walk. Although crime rates are somewhat higher compared to other areas of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, a few blocks from my home have witnessed some violent incidents, including shootings and at least one murder. Tragically, our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has only had minor experiences with crime, such as the occasional item going missing from our porch when we forget to bring it inside. This town has been significantly impacted by the opioid crisis affecting many regions across the United States, and fentanyl overdoses have claimed numerous lives. Fortunately, our community offers various resources to address this issue, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training for those supporting individuals struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts several positive features. My son attends an elementary school with exceptional staff, ranging from the principal to the teachers and support team. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered bullying, thanks to the school's supportive environment, and he thoroughly enjoys it there. Our active parent-teacher organization organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family participation and academic growth. With over 20% of our town's residents living below the poverty line, the elementary school provides complimentary breakfast and lunch to ensure no child goes hungry. No family is treated differently due to financial constraints, and school-related expenses are kept affordable. The City Council and staff have made significant strides in enhancing the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, most of these efforts are concentrated in the town center and the western side, where shopping areas and traffic are prevalent. The eastern side, where I live, often feels overlooked, which is a source of frustration for my neighbors. Overall, I genuinely enjoy living here. The community is friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs. Our home, while not highly valued, is comfortable and suits us well. We've been part of this town for over 16 years and can hardly envision living elsewhere.",
            "In my neighborhood, culture thrives in every corner. Perched on a hill, it's encircled by historically significant structures. My residence is a seven-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block further down the hill, there's a unique arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd, especially on warm summer nights. During June and July weekends, it's common to see a line of people outside, eagerly waiting to enter. A few blocks up lies the city's nearest park, surprisingly large for its urban location. The park is enclosed by concrete walls with tall stairs leading down. In the cold winter months, homeless individuals often set up their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. Although snow is rare, the heavy mid-winter rains make staying warm a challenge. By clustering their tents close in the city center, rather than the outskirts, they can better fend off the chill. Moreover, they remain within a reasonable distance to the only family center in miles where they can access bathing facilities. What I cherish most about my city isn't its historic beauty—the grand buildings and the eclectic architecture that cascades down the hills to the ocean. It's the vibrant culture of the people. Hilltop, once infamous for gang violence on the West Coast, still echoes with stories from that era. Even now, three decades later, tales of federal raids and the DEA's attempts to clean the streets are shared. The community remembers. Stories are passed down, reaching newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the city's tougher areas, residents strive to maintain and improve it. They care deeply about their surroundings. There's a lingering caution—people say it's unsafe for a white person to walk Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, shaped by outdated social norms. Perhaps my ambiguous appearance helps me blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone attuned to the enduring issues of racism and ignorance, even in a city celebrated for its diversity. Regardless of how far I wander, Hilltop remains my home. Walking those streets at night invigorates me, meeting people more inclined to offer a jacket than harm. It's a place where laundromat owners extend their hours so I can charge my phone when there's no refuge from the rain. It's where I've sat, believing myself unseen, only to have a stranger acknowledge me, offer five dollars, and affirm my worth and beauty.",
            "I relocated to this area right before starting eighth grade, and initially, it was challenging for me to form friendships. Eventually, I became close with a neighbor living two doors down and another person on my street. Although they both have since moved away, the memories remain vivid. Most of the residents who were here when I arrived have stayed. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area, characterized by numerous two-story houses. On weekends or whenever the weather is pleasant, the sounds of children playing outdoors fill the air. The neighborhood maintains a quiet atmosphere most of the time. I've never had any issues with the residents here. People generally respect your privacy unless assistance is needed. I've ordered several packages online, and they've always been safely delivered without any theft. I have a sense of trust in my neighbors. A park is located just a minute or two from my house, holding many memories for me. I've played various sports like basketball, football, and baseball there with friends. One of my worst memories also happened there, involving a football accident where I got elbowed in the nose, but the positive memories far outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, my visits to the park are mainly to spend time with my cousin's children, who are much younger and still enjoy activities like swings and slides. Just the thought of going to the park excites them. The park evokes a strong sense of nostalgia for me for various reasons. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a wide range of cuisines. Within a mile, one can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people now opt for food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food is particularly popular, as it is in most suburban areas, and there are plenty of pizza places. The local stores provide everything one might need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores reflect the area's diversity, like an Indian-owned shop for those interested in either homemade or ready-made Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about and seeing reports of the difficulties others face with their neighbors makes me thankful for the community I have.",
            "I live in a neighborhood that’s conveniently close to my college, which makes it quite enjoyable for me. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, but there are also some restaurants and bars that offer a fun time without being too pricey. One bar recently changed its name and, while it's more costly, the quality isn't too bad. The community is generally friendly, consisting mainly of college students and individuals with lower incomes due to the affordability of the apartments. An elementary school nearby means there are many children around. Although I don’t know my neighbors well, I’m not particularly interested in doing so. They tend to smoke a lot, so the building management installed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not slightly offensive. The buildings in my vicinity often appear old but might have updated interiors. Further down the street are some newly constructed apartments that I dislike because of their poor-quality building work, despite the high rent, which seems unfair. However, their proximity to campus allows management to charge more. Nearby, there is an inexpensive restaurant that serves food on paper plates, mostly prepared in a microwave. Across from it is a gas station reputed to be a difficult place to work. Last summer, the city funded a road renovation, resulting in a new wide sidewalk and plenty of greenery, making the area more appealing. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, although some have been cut down, leaving stumps. There are more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line leading to another set of apartments. I reside on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, right behind, is less appealing. Its sidewalks are in disrepair, and the buildings look run-down. Trees on this street might be there to conceal the buildings' appearance. Most crime in the area occurs at a complex on that street, but I can’t entirely attribute the issue to them, as there are also apartments across from me with significant crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like my residence. It’s affordable, with lots of useful amenities nearby. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops that make it easy to reach the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, you'll find duplexes neatly arranged along a cul-de-sac. They're spaced in a way that gives the impression of standalone homes, each uniquely painted in yellow with charming white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly and often gather casually at the end of a driveway in the evenings, exchanging small talk while the neighborhood kids indulge in their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It feels like a refreshing escape from the high-tech, fast-paced modern world, almost as if we've stepped into a different era. The area is enveloped by fields and trees, accentuated by blue skies and fluffy white clouds. \n\nHowever, this season has brought tornado warnings, and just last night, the sirens blared for the first time, sending us seeking cover. I ended up in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, was too anxious to join us and stayed in the living room, barking nervously at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was eerily silent except for the sound of large hailstones striking the ground. After the storm passed, the road seemed to steam due to the rapid temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail quickly melted upon hitting the hot pavement. As I looked up at the clearing sky, the sun emerged and it began to rain, revealing a stunning double rainbow. Eager to capture the moment, I hurried inside to fetch my camera and snapped photos to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the storm had hit. Then, life resumed its normal rhythm, with moms and kids outside while dinner was being prepared. \n\nThis friendly neighborhood has been a wonderful change for me since moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the charming southern accents here. My apartment, like all others, has two bedrooms and two bathrooms, yet despite the uniform exterior, not all the apartments are identical inside; some are surprisingly compact, which baffles me. I enjoy taking leisurely walks across the expansive field behind my home and wandering down to the pond, which isn’t suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer and can often hear the giant bullfrog crooning in the mornings. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the crowing of roosters from nearby farms, making it feel like living in a quaint, self-contained village. We even have a donkey on a neighboring farm whose braying in the evening reminds us of his presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for close to a decade, I feel I've gathered enough experiences to share. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was quite emotional for me. I left behind people I cherished, and adjusting was tough—I even shed some tears. However, my parents were determined to provide the best opportunities for my sister and me, which meant relocating to a neighborhood with better housing and educational prospects. Over time, I adapted, making both friends and a few adversaries during my school years. My interactions with neighbors were limited, save for Mr. Glen, his kids, and Dennis, who lived nearby. They became almost like family to me, and I hold them in high regard. A memorable occasion was attending Mr. Glen’s remarriage ceremony with my family. It was a joyful event, and I aspire to create similar happiness in my future. I even caught the garter Ms. Veda tossed, though I missed the bouquet. The evening was filled with dancing, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, whom I haven't seen since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood can be confusing, but with GPS, I've been able to explore more extensively, especially with friends like Kason and Curtis. We spent countless hours gaming and making the most of our time. Occasionally, I visit the park to connect with nature, which brings me tranquility. I enjoy practicing balance with sticks from the hardware store and wielding my bokken. There are also courts for basketball and tennis, though I haven't played in a while. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, pushing us hard, yet ensuring we had a blast. Reflecting on these experiences, I'm grateful for the fun I've had here, and I remain optimistic that the future holds even more joy.",
            "My hometown is a charming little spot that doesn't particularly shine among the others in South Carolina, yet it plays a crucial role in the agriculture sector. Johnston has earned the title of the Peach Capital of the World, a claim proudly displayed on its welcome sign. The area is largely made up of farmland, primarily featuring peach orchards or cattle pastures. Homes outside the town center are spaced far apart, often two stories high with either metal roofs designed to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Typically, these homes are set back from the road to make room for fields in front, used for crops or livestock. In the heart of town, a single traffic light governs a four-way intersection, where the only stores in town are located. For quick meals, there are just three options: Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once operated here but has since closed. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is humorously more famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola than its medical supplies. IGA, a small yet pricey grocery store, is the sole place for food shopping, though most people prefer traveling to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their primary grocery needs. The most frequented store in town is Dollar General, where a wide variety of everyday items is sold, bustling from opening to closing. Possibilities Furniture & More, a quaint furniture shop run by a beloved local, has been a fixture in Johnston for years, even offering delivery services with their two movers. Attached to this building is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service providing everything from daycare to nail trimming. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic are located outside the town's core, small but well-equipped to serve the community. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only school. After finishing fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in a neighboring town. Technically, there are no parks, but plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational space to offer families more activities and draw in visitors or new residents. While the town lacks amenities like movie theaters, bowling alleys, social spots, children's playgrounds, walking areas for pets, or diverse dining options, it remains a pleasant, albeit tiny place that could be missed if you blink as you pass by!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a quaint southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, resulting in a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I'm quite familiar with most of the residents. Generally, people occupy themselves with yard work and daily chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of the street, giving us a view of everyone coming and going throughout the day, making us familiar with the cars in the area. When an unfamiliar vehicle appears, we often take notice. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes, engaging in all the usual activities you'd expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from here. There are four of us: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. So, I believe others are accustomed to our comings and goings too. We enjoy playing outside, even in the rain sometimes. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, and the aroma is always delightful. It seems someone is always mowing their lawn, and the sound of a lawn mower is a regular presence from March until about October, when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood, originally a wooded area, has many trees providing ample shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, requiring annual raking and burning. I enjoy the scent of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winter hasn't been significant, making it feel like an extended fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which isn't often. I occasionally work on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are usually quiet, except during Thanksgiving when families host visitors from out of town, leading to extra cars parked around. Similar patterns occur during other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here, and if it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "Located right in the heart of the high desert, my neighborhood is surrounded by endless stretches of dirt. For those who haven't lived here, it's hard to grasp the constant presence of brown hues, and spotting a lawn is a clear indication of someone investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s, when I first moved here, homes were scattered with considerable distance between them. While this remains relatively unchanged, numerous new constructions have appeared. Frankly, this area is increasingly resembling a city, but I suppose that’s a common trend in many places. Generally, the locals are quite amicable, though, like any urban area, it has its ups and downs. The elderly folks around me are particularly friendly, suggesting it’s a pleasant neighborhood. The retail scene is dominated by chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For more upscale shopping, one must venture out, as Whole Foods and similar stores are rare here. Construction seems to be the leading industry in my city, based on my observations rather than official data. This likely stems from the city’s ongoing development, with plenty of open land still available for building. The thought of further expansion is somewhat unsettling for me, as I prefer the current state of things. Having left a large city, I'm reluctant to return to that lifestyle. My full-time job is in construction, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. One aspect I love about living here is the diverse wildlife. Many are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty. The unique climate and terrain create ecosystems worthy of protection, housing various wildlife species. It's essential for the human residents to acquaint themselves with these non-human inhabitants to ensure peaceful coexistence. My family and I have adapted well to living alongside wildlife. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects, and as I write this, they are outside attempting to capture different samples. As for local attractions, there are a few. Victorville offers families a chance to experience the desert’s distinct charm. If possible, plan your visit around the San Bernardino County Fair for a truly enriching experience. You might also want to visit Wrightwood to enjoy snow-covered mountains and winter sports lessons. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert? The Victor Valley Museum showcases geological and paleontological samples, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate Victorville’s societal and industrial development.",
            "When considering how to describe my neighborhood, my perspective might be a bit unconventional. Unlike many who might define their neighborhood in terms of homeownership and distinct personal lives, my experience is a little different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the dormitory community as my closest circle. I also include the broader campus in my neighborhood concept, though to a lesser extent. Despite this unusual take, my neighborhood bears similarities to traditional ones. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine has residences, people, shops, and green spaces. Let's start by discussing the \"residences\" that make up my neighborhood. It’s helpful to clarify the types of housing found here. In my immediate area, there are three categories: apartments, traditional houses, and dormitories. First, the apartments usually accommodate 2-4 people per room, with about 4-6 rooms per floor. With most buildings having two floors, around 20 people live in each. Next, there are the actual houses available for school-affiliated individuals, typically with 2-4 bedrooms and often occupied by alumni. However, these houses are less common due to their inefficiency. Lastly, the dormitories house hundreds of students, with most rooms shared by two people, making it the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. Now that housing is discussed, let's move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, and this is mirrored in my neighborhood. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Professional staff typically reside in the neighborhood houses, while new students stay in dormitories, and older students often choose apartment-style living. Describing the people here doesn't do them justice, so let’s proceed to the stores and parks. My school, essentially a self-contained neighborhood, is home to numerous stores and one park. The stores offer a mix of dining options found in any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery outlets. This means everything needed is accessible within my neighborhood. Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the diverse community, maintained in a clean and safe condition by neighborhood members!",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are a rare sight. My house is perched at the top of the steepest hill in the area, which has earned the nickname \"work out hill\" because joggers frequently tackle it during their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on our street, everyone ends up walking on the road. The road itself is quite uneven, with several potholes that make driving a bit risky. Around the block, the telephone and electric wires have a rather worn-out appearance. Our region experiences frequent rain and storms, causing branches and debris to often knock out power lines, resulting in a patched-up, makeshift look. \n\nEverywhere you look, tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape. However, the locals aren't fond of them, as they block the ocean view. Consequently, many houses are constructed high on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories, offering a panoramic view of the bay. The sunsets are stunning, painting the water with a glowing hue and turning the sky orange. Yet, most days are characterized by a cloudy, overcast sky, with sunlight breaking through only in a haze. The persistent dampness encourages moss to grow on surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, taking me three hours to clean. \n\nThe neighborhood has few children, despite a school just a few blocks away, as it's mostly populated by older, retired individuals. Instead of children, the area is teeming with dogs, frequently seen lounging on lawns or racing down the street. Leaving a door or window open means risking an unexpected canine visitor, like the one I once discovered in my living room and had to escort outside. Rabbits roam freely, much to the dismay of gardeners who find their plants uprooted and lawns burrowed into. My cats enjoy hunting them, and they've significantly reduced their numbers in our vicinity. Birdlife is abundant, with sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, although the local crows usually drive them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but a downhill trek to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. While there's not much of a beach, the rocky shore is perfect for tossing stones into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, allowing for a clear view of the opposite shore, even on misty days.",
            "When you decide to explore Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll discover it's quite easy to reach! The public transit system is widely accessible and remains a favored mode of travel in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban area, maintaining the quintessential New York City atmosphere. During your visit, expect to encounter numerous Asian shops throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll notice an Asian-owned shop practically on every street corner. Among the most frequented are supermarkets and laundromats. These establishments are especially popular with locals due to their excellent food quality, competitive pricing, and overall convenience. In fact, there are four Asian supermarkets located within a short two-minute walk from where I am. This ease of access to groceries is a notable convenience. However, Bensonhurst is not exclusively populated by Asian residents; it is quite diverse, with a mix of immigrants and both first- and second-generation Americans. Many of the significant local businesses are Asian-owned, yet the area also boasts a newly refurbished park nearby. This park features about ten basketball courts, a spacious field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and even a fountain for summertime fun. Naturally, being in New York City, the parks reflect the city's diverse population, fostering an environment where people of various backgrounds can enjoy activities together. In this neighborhood, you won't find many towering corporate buildings. Instead, you'll encounter co-op or condominium apartments, with most residences consisting of two-family homes. The community is generally friendly, albeit quite lively. Expect to hear cars passing by with loud music or engines revving, which can be a morning wake-up call. If you visit at night, it's wise to remain cautious. The area is relatively safe, but unpredictability can be an issue, with potential encounters with troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. Personally, I've experienced bullying in this neighborhood through physical altercations in the past, although this was years ago. There have also been instances of package theft—an unfortunately common occurrence here. Lastly, despite regulations in New York City requiring pet owners to clean up after their dogs, compliance is lacking. You’ll likely come across dog waste on your journey to the train station or the supermarket each morning. This is one of my biggest frustrations about the area; so, watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "When you think about Portland, Oregon, the concept of \"weird\" is key. The city’s unofficial motto, painted on the side of a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes pushing legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this phrase evokes memories of Portland in the '90s and early 2000s, a time when it was less famous and expensive, fostering vibrant and distinct subcultures. For others, it’s an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is now a compliment. Even with the arrival of affluent Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weirdness here doesn’t always mean acceptance, but it does imply acceptance of what is typically not accepted. Being weird doesn’t preclude having modern amenities and challenges. Like the rest of America, we purchase most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird or different, yet Portland has its share of the ordinary. There are yoga classes, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps being weird means not taking these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others in Portland, you’ll find vibrant homes, gardens growing flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes in the summer. These free boxes, usually cardboard or sometimes plastic, offer items someone no longer needs. Often, they hold a little magic—a treasure perfect for the passerby. Typically containing clothes and books, they can hold anything. This enchanting potential of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what defines Portland for me, though I’m just one among many types of weird. Some locals wouldn’t consider picking their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer games. Portland is a city of diverse passions. It’s filled with people chasing our dreams or dreaming of chasing them while spending too much time at the bar. Admittedly, Portland struggles with drug issues. These often stem from mental health problems, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Homelessness is another challenge, with no clear solutions in sight. The city’s homeless are attracted by the social services, which are better than many other places, yet still inadequate. The residents’ attitudes towards the homeless swing between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we are not unique.",
            "The mountains stand constant, watching over the sun's path each morning and evening. Regardless of how often I overlook them, absorbed in the chaos of work and life, they remain steadfast, untouched by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they compel my attention, offering solace and strength to continue, step by step. When I began my undergraduate studies, these northern mountains were what initially caught my attention. Although the university boasts stunning architecture, tranquil ponds, and towering trees, which hold a special place in my heart, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme. The town itself is charming, filled with cozy cafés that served as my study sanctuaries, fueled by caffeine. A short walk or bus ride brings you to downtown, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings exude a historic charm, making this suburban town seem as lively as its urban neighbor. Yet, escape is easy; just pass the library and return to a quieter ambiance. This blend of contrasting atmospheres invites exploration and fosters countless cherished memories tied to different town locales. Whether it's strolling past the park's weathered swings with friends after a sleepless night or racing through the bustling downtown to catch a university-sponsored movie at the upscale theater. Of course, like any place, it also harbors painful memories. The ponds, in particular, are ideal for introspection or midnight cries during existential crises—an experience I'm all too familiar with. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each playing a part, often made me question my own purpose during my journey through life's uncertainties. So, I would wander past the pond, the park, and the quintessential suburban houses, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees and painted the sky. As I looked up at the dawn, I realized I was heading north. There they were, as always. The towering mountains, more imposing than any building, touched the hazy blue and yellow sky, silently reigniting my determination.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it. Situated behind a commercial area, it's not the kind of location where you'd expect to find residential housing, or at least not homes that are particularly appealing. But if you venture beyond the deserted Whole Foods and bypass the hotels that only see guests during summer family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. In these neighborhoods, the streets are lined with a series of apartment complexes nestled together like meticulously arranged Russian nesting dolls, each one positioned thoughtfully in a row down the street. The initial set of apartments has gained some notoriety due to unsavory incidents covered by the media, so we'll steer clear of dwelling on those—they remind us that looks can be deceiving. However, the adjacent complexes offer a glimpse into a different world, largely unknown to the locals. Across the street from these complexes is a satellite campus of a community college—a tranquil collection of buildings that quietly watch over the road. Students, clutching coffee and still shaking off sleep, trickle in at 7 a.m. for the start of their day. The creaky iron gates swing open to welcome them, while commuters lament their presence for causing traffic delays on days of high attendance. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people recovering from unfortunate injuries on the other. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a slowly rotating ceiling fan that stirs the warm, heavy summer air. Children dart across the park's grassy expanse, turning cartwheels and somersaults through the sharp green blades, as bees hover lazily among the roadside flowers. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, casting disapproving glances at skateboarding teenagers while politely acknowledging the teenage girls gathered at the playground, chatting about boys and the latest online trends. Nearby, there's a sushi restaurant in a strip mall next to the park, offering affordable meals yet rarely crowded—a swim shop sits adjacent, with a nail salon nestled in between. Here, you could simultaneously prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, frequently visited by teens from the park, who clutch their chilled, sweating cups of yogurt topped with an assortment of treats as they practice skateboard tricks and vape to impress their peers. This neighborhood represents a slice of Americana—a snapshot of history in the tranquil South, where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood has a unique charm. Most residences are single-family houses, though a few have been cleverly divided into two, maintaining their connectedness, if that makes any sense. My own house features a modest yard at the front and a small driveway on the left side. The area, much like many others, evokes memories of a not-so-distant past when suburban living epitomized the American dream. While this dream once warmly embraced the nation, it now seems to be slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood, like many others, persists and beckons both residents and visitors, suggesting that the dream endures, and we cling to it as best we can. The residents may not be as optimistic as before; the once meticulously kept yards aren't as pristine, but cars still fill the driveways, and children still play, seeing their surroundings as their whole world. The local public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking fond memories among the older generation. Churches are sparse and often empty, yet the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has its distinct appearance but shares a familiar essence. A large supermarket named Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family who are likely the only Arab family in the area, serves the community. Most residents are African American. The streets are broad, and children often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many neighborhood families have lived here for generations, sharing stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but interest waned when Hollywood stopped producing Karate Kid movies, so it became a pharmacy—because, as they say, medicine solves everything. A small movie theater shows classic films at a discount, overlooked by the younger crowd due to its lack of new releases but cherished by older patrons who appreciate an affordable night out without kids. A single freeway runs through town, though its exits and entrances are located in the neighboring town. A petition once sought to add an exit for our town. The youth championed it, but the elders opposed it, arguing an exit would spoil our town, and they succeeded in convincing the city council to reject the request. A new high school is under construction, and we are debating a mascot for our town. I believe a cyborg with a Southern accent and a log cabin would perfectly capture the spirit of our community.",
            "Living in a bustling city, my neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity. Residential zones blend seamlessly with commercial areas, hosting an array of businesses. Some are office spaces, while others are shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's a constant stream of new restaurants to try and stores to explore. We have both large, recognizable chain stores and small, trendy boutiques. These boutiques aren't confined to malls; they also line the streets, often just a short stroll from neighborhoods that would be peaceful if not for the myriad attractions. Nearby parks offer a retreat, and they're popular spots for families with children. The neighborhood itself is a melting pot, with a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish population, and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate area, the city hosts a wider range of ethnic communities, like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, all within a few miles but often a lengthy drive due to the notorious traffic. Despite the city's size, walking isn't the favored mode of transport, leading to some of the worst traffic congestion globally and challenging parking situations. Interestingly, there's been a surge in construction, with large apartment complexes springing up, attracting more residents—and adding to the traffic woes. Housing options are varied, from sprawling houses to smaller apartments and condos. Single-family homes and duplexes coexist even in my own neighborhood, reflecting the diversity of living spaces. The community is intergenerational, though I must admit I don't know many of my neighbors. It's not the cohesive community it once was, but I fondly recall childhood days spent playing outside with my next-door neighbor and friends of similar age.",
            "As we drove by the expansive cornfields stretching out to the horizon, she turned to me and asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied with a chuckle, \"This is it!\" Her surprise was palpable, accustomed as she was to a town where a grocery store was just a short stroll from her home. She had never encountered such vast open spaces. As she took in the seemingly endless cornfields, I began to share the story of my upbringing in rural Ohio, a place that shaped who I am. \n\nNavigating the narrow country road, we eventually passed a water-filled quarry before arriving at my neighborhood. The houses here, mostly made of brick and stucco, each sit on a generous half-acre of land. Residents take pride in their gardens, which burst with flowers every spring, complemented by the ever-changing hues of Midwest trees. Driveways gleam with luxury Mercedes Benz cars, freshly washed and shining brilliantly in the midday sun.\n\nAs we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was outside, as usual, with a welcoming smile. He spends his days meticulously mowing his lawn and is known for singing over the sound of his mower. His jovial nature endears him to everyone, though age has mellowed some of his sharpness. He once practiced medicine and now blends seamlessly into his surroundings with his John Deere mower.\n\nUpon reaching my home, we find the side yard teeming with geese, playfully chased by our Terrier. In the back, a small stream meanders into the quarry, its gentle sounds mingling with the calls of bullfrogs and the distant \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched retreat, a haven of wild trees, herbs, and flowers. This was my childhood playground, where tree forts were constructed, and 'hunting' adventures took place, often involving nothing more than chasing after animals. There was always a neighborhood kid around for companionship.\n\nThe winters here can be harsh, yet they unveil a unique beauty. The green landscape turns into a stark wilderness, with once-vibrant trees becoming skeletal forms. When snow graces the ground, a winter wonderland emerges as if by magic. The backyard becomes a canvas for snow angels created by my little sister, alongside snowmen we built together. Our childhood clashes often erupted into snowball fights, with forts constructed from branches serving as our armories. In this wintry paradise, we played make-believe, lost in a world where nothing else mattered. We were simply children, carefree and full of imagination."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "I reside in a rural part of America, specifically in a small town located in Michigan. Here, the landscape transitions seamlessly from expansive farmland to quaint tourist destinations. You won't find large shopping malls or chain stores like Walmart, Target, or Applebee's. To reach any destination, driving is a necessity. Despite this, I consider my home to be among the most stunning places globally, thanks to its proximity to water. My town is nestled between the majestic Lake Michigan on one side and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Beaches are abundant and easily accessible for anyone wishing to enjoy a leisurely day by the water.\n\nThe neighborhood I call home epitomizes the essence of small-town living. Houses are not crammed together nor are they identical in design. Many are older structures, some undergoing renovations, while others retain their vintage charm. Most houses feature full basements visible from the street, and you’ll notice that many have traditional aluminum siding. The homes in my area showcase a variety of colors, creating a vibrant community atmosphere. Yards are common, often adorned with trampolines, playsets, gardens, and fences for pets. This neighborhood mirrors Middle America, inhabited by hardworking individuals who are either raising families or already have.\n\nThe streets are lively, with children playing and people engaging in activities like walking dogs, biking, or rollerblading. Neighbors are familiar with one another, easily identifying residents and newcomers. It’s typical to see someone grilling and exchange a friendly wave, or encounter a dog walker from a few blocks away and share a smile. Lawns are well-maintained; there are no remnants of autumn leaves cluttering the yards, and the grass is kept neatly trimmed. While the neighborhood may not boast stunning architecture, it exudes a warm, inviting aura, ideal for family life. It is a serene, safe, and peaceful community. \n\nWithin a short stroll, you'll find the county sheriff’s department and jail, with the health department conveniently next door. The city’s recycling center is also nearby, serving both local residents and those from surrounding areas. Close by are baseball and softball fields where the lively sounds of games in progress fill the air. Adjacent to these fields is our modest town airport, where the hum of small aircraft is a familiar backdrop to daily life. A local ice cream shop provides a delightful treat, and downtown is within reachable distance from our neighborhood. My children can easily bike to a park just eight blocks away. Indeed, it's a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The area where I reside can be best described as a classic suburban environment. Specifically, in my neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner's association is quite evident. As you enter, you'll notice rows of well-kept single-family homes, thanks to the homeowner's association's efforts. The front yards are mostly uniform: small sections of landscaped grass, decorative stones, and short driveways, with an occasional small tree. Every house features a two-car garage. As you drive through the neighborhood, you'll find newly paved roads. Despite the variety of families living here, the streets remain in excellent condition with no potholes in sight. Most homes are single-story, though there are some two-story houses too. Our mailbox setup is unique for single-family homes; instead of individual mailboxes, there is a cluster of mailboxes at the end of the street, similar to apartments. Residents use keys to access their specific mailboxes, and there are larger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another hallmark of the HOA's influence. My house is located on the outskirts of the nearby city, giving the neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban characteristics. This location provides ample space for various amenities. There are several community pools, accessible to all residents, that are well-maintained and gated. Additionally, there are walking trails for leisurely strolls or dog walks, eliminating the need to visit a park for exercise. The neighborhood is spacious enough for a substantial run. The community is primarily composed of retirees, making it a safe area where neighbors look out for each other, though there are also some middle-aged and young professionals. The city itself is surprisingly large population-wise but maintains a small-town feel. It offers a wide range of amenities. For example, we have one mall; it's not enormous, but it serves its purpose. A 15-minute drive gets me to various significant locations with different stores to choose from. We have everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to discount outlets with limited stock and minimal staff to keep costs low. Overall, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and quite typical, with attractive features like pools and walking trails. Shopping isn't immediately nearby, but a short drive connects us to major chains.",
            "I first learned about my neighborhood while listening to a podcast discussing missing persons. The information caught me off guard. Nearly every apartment nearby costs over a thousand dollars monthly. My friends and I had never heard of that case before. Perhaps it’s the struggle that resonates. Several of my friends often find themselves shedding tears at night. Life is costly, but over time we've mastered frugality. The scent of dusty flea market toys and clothes stored with mothballs becomes familiar. As an adult, you notice smells less frequently. You might take up smoking or simply get used to how things are. Yet, the flea market fragrance is unmistakable. The aroma of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano, lingering in leather even after cleaning. Here, three thrift stores are within walking distance. Starting from the far end, you can visit two charity shops, a library, a rare bookstore, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people crowding the streets each morning, yet the thrift stores remain serene. Regardless of the traffic outside, the shops are tranquil. It’s an ideal spot to while away an afternoon. Each year, the influx of people and cars grows. The city is evolving, they claim. It hosts one of the major e-commerce and delivery giants, yet it still experiences growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, with little demanded of you. You can be solitary, reserved, and self-reliant, and others will respect your space. It's different from the South, where showing concern is a sign of caring. Here, personal boundaries are respected. You can maintain your privacy as long as you wish, while the city ebbs and flows like the ocean waves. It’s a vibrant environment. With a pianist next door and two aspiring singers upstairs, there’s always activity. In a sense, our building is less a collection of strangers and more a community of friends. We unite for support, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and assist each other when possible. I feel fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make sure to clean up after myself and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail, and I enjoy seeing them, believing they appreciate my presence as much as I do theirs. Despite living in a vast, impersonal modern complex, it's the people like my neighbors who make me feel that my life choices weren't entirely misguided.",
            "I reside in a modest town in the Midwest, situated just beyond the suburban edge of a large city. My neighborhood, located on the eastern side, is often considered one of the town's less affluent sections. The housing market here is quite affordable, with many properties either rented out or owned by individuals with lower incomes. Nonetheless, it remains a pleasant and welcoming place. My neighbors are generally amiable, often greeting me with a smile and a hello when I'm out for a walk. Although crime rates are somewhat higher compared to other areas of town, they remain relatively low. Over the past decade, a few blocks from my home have witnessed some violent incidents, including shootings and at least one murder. Tragically, our next-door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside a local bar last year. Thankfully, our family has only had minor experiences with crime, such as the occasional item going missing from our porch when we forget to bring it inside. This town has been significantly impacted by the opioid crisis affecting many regions across the United States, and fentanyl overdoses have claimed numerous lives. Fortunately, our community offers various resources to address this issue, including addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training for those supporting individuals struggling with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts several positive features. My son attends an elementary school with exceptional staff, ranging from the principal to the teachers and support team. Even with his special needs, he has not encountered bullying, thanks to the school's supportive environment, and he thoroughly enjoys it there. Our active parent-teacher organization organizes numerous events throughout the year to encourage family participation and academic growth. With over 20% of our town's residents living below the poverty line, the elementary school provides complimentary breakfast and lunch to ensure no child goes hungry. No family is treated differently due to financial constraints, and school-related expenses are kept affordable. The City Council and staff have made significant strides in enhancing the town's appearance, including road repaving, landscaping, and park renovations. Unfortunately, most of these efforts are concentrated in the town center and the western side, where shopping areas and traffic are prevalent. The eastern side, where I live, often feels overlooked, which is a source of frustration for my neighbors. Overall, I genuinely enjoy living here. The community is friendly, the schools are excellent, and there are sufficient shopping options to meet my family's needs. Our home, while not highly valued, is comfortable and suits us well. We've been part of this town for over 16 years and can hardly envision living elsewhere.",
            "In my neighborhood, culture thrives in every corner. Perched on a hill, it's encircled by historically significant structures. My residence is a seven-story apartment building directly opposite an old live theater. Just a block further down the hill, there's a unique arcade bar that attracts a diverse crowd, especially on warm summer nights. During June and July weekends, it's common to see a line of people outside, eagerly waiting to enter. A few blocks up lies the city's nearest park, surprisingly large for its urban location. The park is enclosed by concrete walls with tall stairs leading down. In the cold winter months, homeless individuals often set up their tents in orderly rows along the sidewalk and wide steps. Although snow is rare, the heavy mid-winter rains make staying warm a challenge. By clustering their tents close in the city center, rather than the outskirts, they can better fend off the chill. Moreover, they remain within a reasonable distance to the only family center in miles where they can access bathing facilities. What I cherish most about my city isn't its historic beauty—the grand buildings and the eclectic architecture that cascades down the hills to the ocean. It's the vibrant culture of the people. Hilltop, once infamous for gang violence on the West Coast, still echoes with stories from that era. Even now, three decades later, tales of federal raids and the DEA's attempts to clean the streets are shared. The community remembers. Stories are passed down, reaching newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the city's tougher areas, residents strive to maintain and improve it. They care deeply about their surroundings. There's a lingering caution—people say it's unsafe for a white person to walk Hilltop after dark. I believe this warning is a relic of the past, shaped by outdated social norms. Perhaps my ambiguous appearance helps me blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone attuned to the enduring issues of racism and ignorance, even in a city celebrated for its diversity. Regardless of how far I wander, Hilltop remains my home. Walking those streets at night invigorates me, meeting people more inclined to offer a jacket than harm. It's a place where laundromat owners extend their hours so I can charge my phone when there's no refuge from the rain. It's where I've sat, believing myself unseen, only to have a stranger acknowledge me, offer five dollars, and affirm my worth and beauty.",
            "I relocated to this area right before starting eighth grade, and initially, it was challenging for me to form friendships. Eventually, I became close with a neighbor living two doors down and another person on my street. Although they both have since moved away, the memories remain vivid. Most of the residents who were here when I arrived have stayed. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburban area, characterized by numerous two-story houses. On weekends or whenever the weather is pleasant, the sounds of children playing outdoors fill the air. The neighborhood maintains a quiet atmosphere most of the time. I've never had any issues with the residents here. People generally respect your privacy unless assistance is needed. I've ordered several packages online, and they've always been safely delivered without any theft. I have a sense of trust in my neighbors. A park is located just a minute or two from my house, holding many memories for me. I've played various sports like basketball, football, and baseball there with friends. One of my worst memories also happened there, involving a football accident where I got elbowed in the nose, but the positive memories far outweigh the negative ones. Nowadays, my visits to the park are mainly to spend time with my cousin's children, who are much younger and still enjoy activities like swings and slides. Just the thought of going to the park excites them. The park evokes a strong sense of nostalgia for me for various reasons. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a wide range of cuisines. Within a mile, one can find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, many people now opt for food delivery services like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food is particularly popular, as it is in most suburban areas, and there are plenty of pizza places. The local stores provide everything one might need, including multiple dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is well-known in the Midwest. Some stores reflect the area's diversity, like an Indian-owned shop for those interested in either homemade or ready-made Indian cuisine. Overall, I appreciate my neighborhood. Reading about and seeing reports of the difficulties others face with their neighbors makes me thankful for the community I have.",
            "I live in a neighborhood that’s conveniently close to my college, which makes it quite enjoyable for me. The area is mostly filled with apartment buildings, but there are also some restaurants and bars that offer a fun time without being too pricey. One bar recently changed its name and, while it's more costly, the quality isn't too bad. The community is generally friendly, consisting mainly of college students and individuals with lower incomes due to the affordability of the apartments. An elementary school nearby means there are many children around. Although I don’t know my neighbors well, I’m not particularly interested in doing so. They tend to smoke a lot, so the building management installed an air freshener near their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing, if not slightly offensive. The buildings in my vicinity often appear old but might have updated interiors. Further down the street are some newly constructed apartments that I dislike because of their poor-quality building work, despite the high rent, which seems unfair. However, their proximity to campus allows management to charge more. Nearby, there is an inexpensive restaurant that serves food on paper plates, mostly prepared in a microwave. Across from it is a gas station reputed to be a difficult place to work. Last summer, the city funded a road renovation, resulting in a new wide sidewalk and plenty of greenery, making the area more appealing. My apartment building is surrounded by trees, although some have been cut down, leaving stumps. There are more trees here than further down the street. Behind my complex is a tree line leading to another set of apartments. I reside on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, right behind, is less appealing. Its sidewalks are in disrepair, and the buildings look run-down. Trees on this street might be there to conceal the buildings' appearance. Most crime in the area occurs at a complex on that street, but I can’t entirely attribute the issue to them, as there are also apartments across from me with significant crime and a transient population. Despite this, I like my residence. It’s affordable, with lots of useful amenities nearby. The university is within walking distance, and there are two bus stops that make it easy to reach the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, you'll find duplexes neatly arranged along a cul-de-sac. They're spaced in a way that gives the impression of standalone homes, each uniquely painted in yellow with charming white porches and green metal roofs. Most of the residents are friendly and often gather casually at the end of a driveway in the evenings, exchanging small talk while the neighborhood kids indulge in their toys, draw with sidewalk chalk, or fly kites. It feels like a refreshing escape from the high-tech, fast-paced modern world, almost as if we've stepped into a different era. The area is enveloped by fields and trees, accentuated by blue skies and fluffy white clouds. \n\nHowever, this season has brought tornado warnings, and just last night, the sirens blared for the first time, sending us seeking cover. I ended up in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, along with my purse and a few pillows. My larger dog, however, was too anxious to join us and stayed in the living room, barking nervously at the unusual situation. The neighborhood was eerily silent except for the sound of large hailstones striking the ground. After the storm passed, the road seemed to steam due to the rapid temperature drop from 92 to 75 degrees. The hail quickly melted upon hitting the hot pavement. As I looked up at the clearing sky, the sun emerged and it began to rain, revealing a stunning double rainbow. Eager to capture the moment, I hurried inside to fetch my camera and snapped photos to share with friends and family on Facebook. They were just as amazed as I was. The streets stayed quiet for about an hour until people began returning home after the storm had hit. Then, life resumed its normal rhythm, with moms and kids outside while dinner was being prepared. \n\nThis friendly neighborhood has been a wonderful change for me since moving from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love the charming southern accents here. My apartment, like all others, has two bedrooms and two bathrooms, yet despite the uniform exterior, not all the apartments are identical inside; some are surprisingly compact, which baffles me. I enjoy taking leisurely walks across the expansive field behind my home and wandering down to the pond, which isn’t suitable for swimming. I've spotted deer and can often hear the giant bullfrog crooning in the mornings. It's a fantastic place to live, just a forty-minute drive from Charlotte. Each morning is greeted by the crowing of roosters from nearby farms, making it feel like living in a quaint, self-contained village. We even have a donkey on a neighboring farm whose braying in the evening reminds us of his presence. I feel fortunate to have discovered this charming neighborhood.",
            "Having lived here for close to a decade, I feel I've gathered enough experiences to share. Initially, moving from Riverdale to Stockbridge was quite emotional for me. I left behind people I cherished, and adjusting was tough—I even shed some tears. However, my parents were determined to provide the best opportunities for my sister and me, which meant relocating to a neighborhood with better housing and educational prospects. Over time, I adapted, making both friends and a few adversaries during my school years. My interactions with neighbors were limited, save for Mr. Glen, his kids, and Dennis, who lived nearby. They became almost like family to me, and I hold them in high regard. A memorable occasion was attending Mr. Glen’s remarriage ceremony with my family. It was a joyful event, and I aspire to create similar happiness in my future. I even caught the garter Ms. Veda tossed, though I missed the bouquet. The evening was filled with dancing, and I particularly enjoyed spending time with Marsharii, one of their daughters, whom I haven't seen since. I hope she's doing well. The neighborhood can be confusing, but with GPS, I've been able to explore more extensively, especially with friends like Kason and Curtis. We spent countless hours gaming and making the most of our time. Occasionally, I visit the park to connect with nature, which brings me tranquility. I enjoy practicing balance with sticks from the hardware store and wielding my bokken. There are also courts for basketball and tennis, though I haven't played in a while. My dad introduced me and my best friend to tennis with Mr. Graves, pushing us hard, yet ensuring we had a blast. Reflecting on these experiences, I'm grateful for the fun I've had here, and I remain optimistic that the future holds even more joy.",
            "My hometown is a charming little spot that doesn't particularly shine among the others in South Carolina, yet it plays a crucial role in the agriculture sector. Johnston has earned the title of the Peach Capital of the World, a claim proudly displayed on its welcome sign. The area is largely made up of farmland, primarily featuring peach orchards or cattle pastures. Homes outside the town center are spaced far apart, often two stories high with either metal roofs designed to counter the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Typically, these homes are set back from the road to make room for fields in front, used for crops or livestock. In the heart of town, a single traffic light governs a four-way intersection, where the only stores in town are located. For quick meals, there are just three options: Hong Kong, a cozy family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a small burger chain. A pizzeria once operated here but has since closed. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is humorously more famous for its Cherry Coca-Cola than its medical supplies. IGA, a small yet pricey grocery store, is the sole place for food shopping, though most people prefer traveling to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for their primary grocery needs. The most frequented store in town is Dollar General, where a wide variety of everyday items is sold, bustling from opening to closing. Possibilities Furniture & More, a quaint furniture shop run by a beloved local, has been a fixture in Johnston for years, even offering delivery services with their two movers. Attached to this building is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service providing everything from daycare to nail trimming. Both a doctor's office and a veterinary clinic are located outside the town's core, small but well-equipped to serve the community. Johnston Elementary School is the town's only school. After finishing fifth grade, students attend middle and high school in a neighboring town. Technically, there are no parks, but plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational space to offer families more activities and draw in visitors or new residents. While the town lacks amenities like movie theaters, bowling alleys, social spots, children's playgrounds, walking areas for pets, or diverse dining options, it remains a pleasant, albeit tiny place that could be missed if you blink as you pass by!",
            "I reside in a typical suburban area in a quaint southern town in Tennessee. Our street connects two state highways, resulting in a bit more traffic than I'd prefer, but otherwise, it's a peaceful neighborhood. Not many people move in or out, so I'm quite familiar with most of the residents. Generally, people occupy themselves with yard work and daily chores. During winter, we enjoy sledding down a hill on our side street. Our house is located at the front corner of the street, giving us a view of everyone coming and going throughout the day, making us familiar with the cars in the area. When an unfamiliar vehicle appears, we often take notice. Some neighbors walk for exercise or to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes, engaging in all the usual activities you'd expect. We spend a lot of time at home since we work from here. There are four of us: myself, my wife, and our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. So, I believe others are accustomed to our comings and goings too. We enjoy playing outside, even in the rain sometimes. Occasionally, we barbecue on our back deck, and the aroma is always delightful. It seems someone is always mowing their lawn, and the sound of a lawn mower is a regular presence from March until about October, when the grass stops growing. Our neighborhood, originally a wooded area, has many trees providing ample shade, but also a lot of leaves in the fall, requiring annual raking and burning. I enjoy the scent of burning leaves, signaling the arrival of fall. Recently, winter hasn't been significant, making it feel like an extended fall season. Our garage is at the back of the house, so we rarely use the front door unless someone knocks, which isn't often. I occasionally work on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the garage doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays are usually quiet, except during Thanksgiving when families host visitors from out of town, leading to extra cars parked around. Similar patterns occur during other holidays like Mother's Day and Christmas. Overall, I enjoy living here, and if it weren't a through street, it would be ideal.",
            "Located right in the heart of the high desert, my neighborhood is surrounded by endless stretches of dirt. For those who haven't lived here, it's hard to grasp the constant presence of brown hues, and spotting a lawn is a clear indication of someone investing heavily in its upkeep. Back in the 90s, when I first moved here, homes were scattered with considerable distance between them. While this remains relatively unchanged, numerous new constructions have appeared. Frankly, this area is increasingly resembling a city, but I suppose that’s a common trend in many places. Generally, the locals are quite amicable, though, like any urban area, it has its ups and downs. The elderly folks around me are particularly friendly, suggesting it’s a pleasant neighborhood. The retail scene is dominated by chain stores like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For more upscale shopping, one must venture out, as Whole Foods and similar stores are rare here. Construction seems to be the leading industry in my city, based on my observations rather than official data. This likely stems from the city’s ongoing development, with plenty of open land still available for building. The thought of further expansion is somewhat unsettling for me, as I prefer the current state of things. Having left a large city, I'm reluctant to return to that lifestyle. My full-time job is in construction, specifically as a drywall and T-bar installer. One aspect I love about living here is the diverse wildlife. Many are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty. The unique climate and terrain create ecosystems worthy of protection, housing various wildlife species. It's essential for the human residents to acquaint themselves with these non-human inhabitants to ensure peaceful coexistence. My family and I have adapted well to living alongside wildlife. My three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects, and as I write this, they are outside attempting to capture different samples. As for local attractions, there are a few. Victorville offers families a chance to experience the desert’s distinct charm. If possible, plan your visit around the San Bernardino County Fair for a truly enriching experience.

            "When considering how to describe my neighborhood, my perspective might be a bit unconventional. Unlike many who might define their neighborhood in terms of homeownership and distinct personal lives, my experience is a little different. I view my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the dormitory community as my closest circle. I also include the broader campus in my neighborhood concept, though to a lesser extent. Despite this unusual take, my neighborhood bears similarities to traditional ones. Just like any typical neighborhood, mine has residences, people, shops, and green spaces. Let's start by discussing the \"residences\" that make up my neighborhood. It’s helpful to clarify the types of housing found here. In my immediate area, there are three categories: apartments, traditional houses, and dormitories. First, the apartments usually accommodate 2-4 people per room, with about 4-6 rooms per floor. With most buildings having two floors, around 20 people live in each. Next, there are the actual houses available for school-affiliated individuals, typically with 2-4 bedrooms and often occupied by alumni. However, these houses are less common due to their inefficiency. Lastly, the dormitories house hundreds of students, with most rooms shared by two people, making it the most prevalent housing type in my neighborhood. Now that housing is discussed, let's move on to the people. My school takes pride in its diversity, and this is mirrored in my neighborhood. People from various cultures and age groups live here. Professional staff typically reside in the neighborhood houses, while new students stay in dormitories, and older students often choose apartment-style living. Describing the people here doesn't do them justice, so let’s proceed to the stores and parks. My school, essentially a self-contained neighborhood, is home to numerous stores and one park. The stores offer a mix of dining options found in any neighborhood, along with the school's unique clothing and grocery outlets. This means everything needed is accessible within my neighborhood. Additionally, the park serves as a playground for the diverse community, maintained in a clean and safe condition by neighborhood members!",
            "In my neighborhood, sidewalks are a rare sight. My house is perched at the top of the steepest hill in the area, which has earned the nickname \"work out hill\" because joggers frequently tackle it during their exercise routines. With no sidewalks on our street, everyone ends up walking on the road. The road itself is quite uneven, with several potholes that make driving a bit risky. Around the block, the telephone and electric wires have a rather worn-out appearance. Our region experiences frequent rain and storms, causing branches and debris to often knock out power lines, resulting in a patched-up, makeshift look. \n\nEverywhere you look, tall evergreen trees dominate the landscape. However, the locals aren't fond of them, as they block the ocean view. Consequently, many houses are constructed high on the hill with large glass-fronted second stories, offering a panoramic view of the bay. The sunsets are stunning, painting the water with a glowing hue and turning the sky orange. Yet, most days are characterized by a cloudy, overcast sky, with sunlight breaking through only in a haze. The persistent dampness encourages moss to grow on surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car in the driveway for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, taking me three hours to clean. \n\nThe neighborhood has few children, despite a school just a few blocks away, as it's mostly populated by older, retired individuals. Instead of children, the area is teeming with dogs, frequently seen lounging on lawns or racing down the street. Leaving a door or window open means risking an unexpected canine visitor, like the one I once discovered in my living room and had to escort outside. Rabbits roam freely, much to the dismay of gardeners who find their plants uprooted and lawns burrowed into. My cats enjoy hunting them, and they've significantly reduced their numbers in our vicinity. Birdlife is abundant, with sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, although the local crows usually drive them away.\n\nThere aren't any shops nearby, but a downhill trek to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. While there's not much of a beach, the rocky shore is perfect for tossing stones into the water. The bay is relatively narrow, allowing for a clear view of the opposite shore, even on misty days.",
            "When you decide to explore Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, you'll discover it's quite easy to reach! The public transit system is widely accessible and remains a favored mode of travel in New York City. Bensonhurst is an urban area, maintaining the quintessential New York City atmosphere. During your visit, expect to encounter numerous Asian shops throughout the neighborhood. Over the last twenty years, Bensonhurst has seen a significant increase in Asian residents. As a result, you'll notice an Asian-owned shop practically on every street corner. Among the most frequented are supermarkets and laundromats. These establishments are especially popular with locals due to their excellent food quality, competitive pricing, and overall convenience. In fact, there are four Asian supermarkets located within a short two-minute walk from where I am. This ease of access to groceries is a notable convenience. However, Bensonhurst is not exclusively populated by Asian residents; it is quite diverse, with a mix of immigrants and both first- and second-generation Americans. Many of the significant local businesses are Asian-owned, yet the area also boasts a newly refurbished park nearby. This park features about ten basketball courts, a spacious field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a children's playground, and even a fountain for summertime fun. Naturally, being in New York City, the parks reflect the city's diverse population, fostering an environment where people of various backgrounds can enjoy activities together. In this neighborhood, you won't find many towering corporate buildings. Instead, you'll encounter co-op or condominium apartments, with most residences consisting of two-family homes. The community is generally friendly, albeit quite lively. Expect to hear cars passing by with loud music or engines revving, which can be a morning wake-up call. If you visit at night, it's wise to remain cautious. The area is relatively safe, but unpredictability can be an issue, with potential encounters with troublemakers, bullies, or thieves. Personally, I've experienced bullying in this neighborhood through physical altercations in the past, although this was years ago. There have also been instances of package theft—an unfortunately common occurrence here. Lastly, despite regulations in New York City requiring pet owners to clean up after their dogs, compliance is lacking. You’ll likely come across dog waste on your journey to the train station or the supermarket each morning. This is one of my biggest frustrations about the area; so, watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "When you think about Portland, Oregon, the concept of \"weird\" is key. The city’s unofficial motto, painted on the side of a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club—sometimes pushing legal boundaries—is \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, this phrase evokes memories of Portland in the '90s and early 2000s, a time when it was less famous and expensive, fostering vibrant and distinct subcultures. For others, it’s an invitation—come to Portland, where being called weird is now a compliment. Even with the arrival of affluent Californians and the ongoing construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weirdness here doesn’t always mean acceptance, but it does imply acceptance of what is typically not accepted. Being weird doesn’t preclude having modern amenities and challenges. Like the rest of America, we purchase most of our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird or different, yet Portland has its share of the ordinary. There are yoga classes, hipsters, and business professionals. Perhaps being weird means not taking these things too seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many others in Portland, you’ll find vibrant homes, gardens growing flowers, herbs, and vegetables along the streets, and free boxes in the summer. These free boxes, usually cardboard or sometimes plastic, offer items someone no longer needs. Often, they hold a little magic—a treasure perfect for the passerby. Typically containing clothes and books, they can hold anything. This enchanting potential of strolling through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what defines Portland for me, though I’m just one among many types of weird. Some locals wouldn’t consider picking their clothes from a box on the sidewalk. They prefer goat yoga (yes, yoga with actual goats) or attending Timbers soccer games. Portland is a city of diverse passions. It’s filled with people chasing our dreams or dreaming of chasing them while spending too much time at the bar. Admittedly, Portland struggles with drug issues. These often stem from mental health problems, exacerbated by the persistent rain and gloomy skies. Homelessness is another challenge, with no clear solutions in sight. The city’s homeless are attracted by the social services, which are better than many other places, yet still inadequate. The residents’ attitudes towards the homeless swing between compassion and disdain. In this aspect, we are not unique.",
            "The mountains stand constant, watching over the sun's path each morning and evening. Regardless of how often I overlook them, absorbed in the chaos of work and life, they remain steadfast, untouched by life's challenges. On particularly stressful days, they compel my attention, offering solace and strength to continue, step by step. When I began my undergraduate studies, these northern mountains were what initially caught my attention. Although the university boasts stunning architecture, tranquil ponds, and towering trees, which hold a special place in my heart, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme. The town itself is charming, filled with cozy cafés that served as my study sanctuaries, fueled by caffeine. A short walk or bus ride brings you to downtown, where the faded bricks of restaurants and office buildings exude a historic charm, making this suburban town seem as lively as its urban neighbor. Yet, escape is easy; just pass the library and return to a quieter ambiance. This blend of contrasting atmospheres invites exploration and fosters countless cherished memories tied to different town locales. Whether it's strolling past the park's weathered swings with friends after a sleepless night or racing through the bustling downtown to catch a university-sponsored movie at the upscale theater. Of course, like any place, it also harbors painful memories. The ponds, in particular, are ideal for introspection or midnight cries during existential crises—an experience I'm all too familiar with. Watching the turtles, ducks, and insects go about their lives, each playing a part, often made me question my own purpose during my journey through life's uncertainties. So, I would wander past the pond, the park, and the quintessential suburban houses, until I reached a main street. It was then that the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees and painted the sky. As I looked up at the dawn, I realized I was heading north. There they were, as always. The towering mountains, more imposing than any building, touched the hazy blue and yellow sky, silently reigniting my determination.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it. Situated behind a commercial area, it's not the kind of location where you'd expect to find residential housing, or at least not homes that are particularly appealing. But if you venture beyond the deserted Whole Foods and bypass the hotels that only see guests during summer family reunions, you'll discover a vibrant community. In these neighborhoods, the streets are lined with a series of apartment complexes nestled together like meticulously arranged Russian nesting dolls, each one positioned thoughtfully in a row down the street. The initial set of apartments has gained some notoriety due to unsavory incidents covered by the media, so we'll steer clear of dwelling on those—they remind us that looks can be deceiving. However, the adjacent complexes offer a glimpse into a different world, largely unknown to the locals. Across the street from these complexes is a satellite campus of a community college—a tranquil collection of buildings that quietly watch over the road. Students, clutching coffee and still shaking off sleep, trickle in at 7 a.m. for the start of their day. The creaky iron gates swing open to welcome them, while commuters lament their presence for causing traffic delays on days of high attendance. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people recovering from unfortunate injuries on the other. The center is adorned with cheerful porch furniture and a slowly rotating ceiling fan that stirs the warm, heavy summer air. Children dart across the park's grassy expanse, turning cartwheels and somersaults through the sharp green blades, as bees hover lazily among the roadside flowers. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, casting disapproving glances at skateboarding teenagers while politely acknowledging the teenage girls gathered at the playground, chatting about boys and the latest online trends. Nearby, there's a sushi restaurant in a strip mall next to the park, offering affordable meals yet rarely crowded—a swim shop sits adjacent, with a nail salon nestled in between. Here, you could simultaneously prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor hibachi chicken—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, frequently visited by teens from the park, who clutch their chilled, sweating cups of yogurt topped with an assortment of treats as they practice skateboard tricks and vape to impress their peers. This neighborhood represents a slice of Americana—a snapshot of history in the tranquil South, where time seems to stand still.",
            "My neighborhood has a unique charm. Most residences are single-family houses, though a few have been cleverly divided into two, maintaining their connectedness, if that makes any sense. My own house features a modest yard at the front and a small driveway on the left side. The area, much like many others, evokes memories of a not-so-distant past when suburban living epitomized the American dream. While this dream once warmly embraced the nation, it now seems to be slipping away. Yet, my neighborhood, like many others, persists and beckons both residents and visitors, suggesting that the dream endures, and we cling to it as best we can. The residents may not be as optimistic as before; the once meticulously kept yards aren't as pristine, but cars still fill the driveways, and children still play, seeing their surroundings as their whole world. The local public school, standing for nearly 90 years, continues to inspire today's youth while evoking fond memories among the older generation. Churches are sparse and often empty, yet the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has its distinct appearance but shares a familiar essence. A large supermarket named Super \"A,\" owned by a Yemeni family who are likely the only Arab family in the area, serves the community. Most residents are African American. The streets are broad, and children often play football, pausing only for passing cars. Many neighborhood families have lived here for generations, sharing stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but interest waned when Hollywood stopped producing Karate Kid movies, so it became a pharmacy—because, as they say, medicine solves everything. A small movie theater shows classic films at a discount, overlooked by the younger crowd due to its lack of new releases but cherished by older patrons who appreciate an affordable night out without kids. A single freeway runs through town, though its exits and entrances are located in the neighboring town. A petition once sought to add an exit for our town. The youth championed it, but the elders opposed it, arguing an exit would spoil our town, and they succeeded in convincing the city council to reject the request. A new high school is under construction, and we are debating a mascot for our town. I believe a cyborg with a Southern accent and a log cabin would perfectly capture the spirit of our community.",
            "Living in a bustling city, my neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity. Residential zones blend seamlessly with commercial areas, hosting an array of businesses. Some are office spaces, while others are shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's a constant stream of new restaurants to try and stores to explore. We have both large, recognizable chain stores and small, trendy boutiques. These boutiques aren't confined to malls; they also line the streets, often just a short stroll from neighborhoods that would be peaceful if not for the myriad attractions. Nearby parks offer a retreat, and they're popular spots for families with children. The neighborhood itself is a melting pot, with a vibrant LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish population, and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Beyond my immediate area, the city hosts a wider range of ethnic communities, like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia, all within a few miles but often a lengthy drive due to the notorious traffic. Despite the city's size, walking isn't the favored mode of transport, leading to some of the worst traffic congestion globally and challenging parking situations. Interestingly, there's been a surge in construction, with large apartment complexes springing up, attracting more residents—and adding to the traffic woes. Housing options are varied, from sprawling houses to smaller apartments and condos. Single-family homes and duplexes coexist even in my own neighborhood, reflecting the diversity of living spaces. The community is intergenerational, though I must admit I don't know many of my neighbors. It's not the cohesive community it once was, but I fondly recall childhood days spent playing outside with my next-door neighbor and friends of similar age.",
            "As we drove by the expansive cornfields stretching out to the horizon, she turned to me and asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied with a chuckle, \"This is it!\" Her surprise was palpable, accustomed as she was to a town where a grocery store was just a short stroll from her home. She had never encountered such vast open spaces. As she took in the seemingly endless cornfields, I began to share the story of my upbringing in rural Ohio, a place that shaped who I am. \n\nNavigating the narrow country road, we eventually passed a water-filled quarry before arriving at my neighborhood. The houses here, mostly made of brick and stucco, each sit on a generous half-acre of land. Residents take pride in their gardens, which burst with flowers every spring, complemented by the ever-changing hues of Midwest trees. Driveways gleam with luxury Mercedes Benz cars, freshly washed and shining brilliantly in the midday sun.\n\nAs we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was outside, as usual, with a welcoming smile. He spends his days meticulously mowing his lawn and is known for singing over the sound of his mower. His jovial nature endears him to everyone, though age has mellowed some of his sharpness. He once practiced medicine and now blends seamlessly into his surroundings with his John Deere mower.\n\nUpon reaching my home, we find the side yard teeming with geese, playfully chased by our Terrier. In the back, a small stream meanders into the quarry, its gentle sounds mingling with the calls of bullfrogs and the distant \"moo\" from nearby farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched retreat, a haven of wild trees, herbs, and flowers. This was my childhood playground, where tree forts were constructed, and 'hunting' adventures took place, often involving nothing more than chasing after animals. There was always a neighborhood kid around for companionship.\n\nThe winters here can be harsh, yet they unveil a unique beauty. The green landscape turns into a stark wilderness, with once-vibrant trees becoming skeletal forms. When snow graces the ground, a winter wonderland emerges as if by magic. The backyard becomes a canvas for snow angels created by my little sister, alongside snowmen we built together. Our childhood clashes often erupted into snowball fights, with forts constructed from branches serving as our armories. In this wintry paradise, we played make-believe, lost in a world where nothing else mattered. We were simply children, carefree and full of imagination."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America lies my home, a small town in Michigan where vast farmlands transition seamlessly into quaint tourist destinations. This area lacks the bustling energy of large city malls, as well as chain stores like Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s—every destination requires a drive. Yet, the location is nothing short of stunning, as it's enveloped by water. The town is flanked by the breathtaking Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering countless beaches for a leisurely stroll or a refreshing dip. My neighborhood epitomizes the essence of a small town. Here, homes aren't crammed together or mass-produced; they are unique, with some having been modernized while others retain their vintage charm. Most houses boast full, visible basements and display a variety of colors with their classic aluminum siding. Each property often features a yard, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes gardens or animal enclosures. This community reflects the spirit of Middle America—diligent individuals nurturing or having nurtured families. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, while residents walk their dogs, cycle, or rollerblade. There's a strong sense of familiarity among neighbors, easily identifying who belongs and who doesn't. It’s common to exchange waves with someone grilling outside or share a friendly smile with a dog walker from another block. Lawns are well-maintained, free of autumn leaves, with neatly trimmed grass, plants, and bushes. While it may not be the most picturesque neighborhood, it exudes warmth and is clearly a wonderful place to raise a family. It's a quiet, peaceful, and secure environment. Though modest in appearance, it embodies the universal desire for a safe haven at the day’s end. Nearby, within walking distance, are the county sheriff's office and jail, the health department, and the city recycling center, all serving the local community. Close by are baseball and softball fields, where the sounds of announcers can be heard echoing names and scores. The small town airport is adjacent, and the gentle hum of small planes taking off and landing is a familiar backdrop. A local ice cream shop offers a sweet treat within strolling distance, and for those who enjoy a walk, downtown is accessible from our neighborhood. My children can easily bike to a park that’s just about eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The place where I reside can be summed up as a classic example of suburban living. In my specific neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner’s association is quite noticeable. As you enter, you’re greeted by rows of neatly kept single-family homes, a testament to the homeowner’s association’s efforts. The front lawns bear a striking similarity: small patches of manicured grass, decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Occasionally, you might see a few small trees. Each home comes with a two-car garage. As you drive around, you’ll observe the freshly paved roads, which are impressively maintained despite the many families who live here. You won’t encounter any potholes or damage. Most of the homes are one-story, although there are occasional two-story ones. Unlike typical single-family homes, we don’t have individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there’s a cluster of mailboxes at the street’s end, similar to an apartment setup. Residents use a key to access their mailbox, and there are two bigger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another result of the HOA’s regulations. My house is situated on the outskirts of a nearby city, making our neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, we have ample space for various activities. There are several community pools, accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and enclosed. Additionally, there are walking trails for dog walks or solo evening strolls. You don’t need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is expansive enough to jog around for a good workout. The community predominantly consists of retired individuals, creating a safe and watchful environment. There are also a few middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it’s surprisingly populous but still retains a small-town vibe. It provides nearly all the essential amenities. For instance, there’s one mall—not enormous, but functional. For me, it takes about 15 minutes to drive to key locations, but once there, a variety of stores are available. Everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to discount outlets with limited selections and minimal staff for cost efficiency can be found. Overall, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and fairly standard. We enjoy amenities like pools and trails, and while we’re not immediately adjacent to shopping areas, a short drive connects us to major retail chains.",
            "The first I learned about my apartment was through a podcast discussing missing persons cases. It came as a bit of a surprise. Most apartments in the vicinity are priced well over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had heard anything about the story. Perhaps it's the hardship. Some of my friends find themselves in tears before falling asleep. Life is costly, but over the years, we've mastered the art of thriftiness. You start to appreciate the musty aroma of toys from flea markets and clothes with mothball scents. As adults, we seem to smell less. You might take up smoking, or maybe you just grow used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market remains a constant. The scent of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It embeds itself in leather and lingers even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you begin at the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, yet you'd never hear it inside the thrifts. Regardless of the number of people or cars passing by, the stores remain quiet. They're perfect for losing an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood in. It's a city in development, they say. Although it hosts the headquarters of a major online commerce and delivery giant, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, and not much is expected from you. You can be solitary, silent, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's unlike the South, where showing concern signifies care. Here, people don't intrude into your life. You can maintain your privacy as long as you wish, and the city will ebb and flow like waves on a shore. It's a vibrant place to be. With a pianist living next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, our apartment isn't just a collection of strangers but a community of friends. We gather for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make an effort to keep my space tidy and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail for one another. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I reside in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, but people like my neighbors make me feel that I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a modest Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban reach of a sizable city. My neighborhood, positioned on the eastern side of town, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property prices here are quite low, with most homes being either rented or owned by individuals with limited incomes. Nonetheless, the area is far from unattractive or unpleasant. The people living nearby are generally amicable and often exchange smiles and greetings as I stroll down the street. Although crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of the town, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, a few violent incidents have occurred within a few blocks from my house, including several shootings and at least one fatality. Tragically, our next-door neighbors lost their son to a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family hasn't been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item disappearing from our porch when we forget to bring it in. The town itself has been deeply touched by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has swept across many regions of the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are several resources available in town to tackle this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for those supporting individuals with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts many positive qualities. My son's elementary school has an outstanding team, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Even with his special needs, he has not experienced any bullying, thanks to the school's incredibly positive environment, and he absolutely loves attending. We have a proactive PTO that organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational advancement. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family or child is regarded as \"less than\" due to financial constraints, and the costs associated with school fees, supplies, and field trips are quite reasonable. The City Council and staff have undertaken several beautification projects in town, including road resurfacing, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Regrettably, most of these improvements have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are located and most traffic flows. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, which is a sore point among my neighbors. On the whole, I enjoy residing in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options (ranging from small businesses to larger retail outlets) to satisfy my family's needs, and while our home might not be of high value, it is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot envision calling any other place home.",
            "My neighborhood is teeming with diverse cultural influences. Perched atop a hill, it's surrounded by buildings that hold historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite the old live theater, and just a block down the hill lies a fascinating arcade bar that attracts a variety of people during warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people eagerly waiting to enter. A few blocks in the opposite direction is the nearest city park, surprisingly large given its urban location. Surrounding the park is a concrete border with tall steps built into it. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals line the sidewalks and wide steps with their tents in neat rows. Though snow is rare, the heavy rain that falls mid-winter makes it challenging to stay warm. By setting their tents close together in the heart of the city rather than in more isolated areas, they manage to keep warmer and remain within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing facilities.\n\nWhat truly endears my city to me is not just its historical charm—the towering buildings and the architecture spread across the hills leading to the ocean—but the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, still carries stories from those times, even three decades later, when federal officials and the DEA attempted to clean up the streets. These stories persist through generations and reach newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the community works hard to maintain its cleanliness and stay informed about local happenings. There's an old saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this caution harks back to earlier times and carries the weight of social conditioning. Perhaps my ambiguous appearance helps me blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the persistent issues of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions rooted in ignorance and fear, even in a city celebrated as a cultural melting pot. No matter how far I travel, Hilltop remains my home. Walking those streets at night invigorates me, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners graciously keep their doors open a bit longer so I can charge my phone when there's no other refuge from the rain. It's a place where, even on the dreariest of nights, someone will stop, look me in the eye, hand me a five-dollar bill, and remind me that I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this area just as I was beginning eighth grade. Initially, forming friendships was a challenge, but eventually, I became close with a neighbor two doors down and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain vivid. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On warm weekends, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, the area is quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the residents; everyone respects your space unless assistance is needed. I've ordered numerous items online, and none have ever been taken from my porch, which makes me feel secure with my neighbors. A park is just a short walk away, where I've accumulated many memories. I've played various sports there, and despite a bad experience of getting an elbow to the nose while playing football, the positive memories outweigh the negative. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's young children, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park now evokes a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a mile, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian options. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food outlets are the most popular, as expected in most suburbs, along with numerous pizza places. The local stores provide all necessities, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco, a well-known Midwest grocery chain, all nearby. There's even an Indian-owned store for anyone interested in cooking or buying Indian food. I genuinely appreciate my neighborhood, especially after hearing about the difficulties others face with their neighbors on social media and the news. It makes me truly grateful for my own experience here.",
            "The neighborhood where I reside is conveniently close to the college I attend, which adds to the enjoyment of living here. The area is predominantly filled with apartment buildings, along with some restaurants and bars that offer a good time without being too pricey. One of the bars recently underwent a name change; though it’s pricier, the quality of service and drinks isn't disappointing. The community generally consists of friendly individuals, mostly college students or those with lower incomes, as the apartments are affordably priced. An elementary school nearby brings many children to the vicinity. While I haven't formed relationships with my neighbors, I'm not particularly inclined to, as they frequently smoke cannabis. This led the building management to install an air freshener unit opposite their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing yet somewhat offensive. Although the buildings around me often appear aged, they might have updated interiors. Further down the street are newer apartments that I dislike due to their poor construction despite high rents, which seem exploitative given their proximity to campus. About five minutes away is an inexpensive eatery that serves meals on paper plates, primarily using microwaved food. Across from it lies a gas station reputed to be an undesirable workplace. However, a city grant allowed for road improvements last summer, resulting in a wide sidewalk and landscaped medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment is surrounded by trees, though some were recently cut, leaving stumps, but there are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my apartment is a tree line, followed by another apartment complex. I reside on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, just behind, is less appealing with deteriorating sidewalks and rundown buildings, which the trees might be intended to conceal. Crime is mostly associated with an apartment complex on that street, although there's also considerable crime and a transient community across from me. Despite these issues, I find my living situation satisfactory due to its affordability and the abundance of nearby amenities. I particularly appreciate the university's walking distance and the two bus stops that facilitate easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, you'll find duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they resemble standalone homes. Each one sports a yellow hue, complemented by white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly with one another, often gathering in the evenings at the end of random driveways to chat while kids play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or kites. This simple camaraderie is a refreshing escape from our technology-driven lives, almost like a glimpse into the past. Surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds overhead, it’s quite picturesque. However, this season brought tornado warnings, and last night, for the first time, the sirens went off, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows. My larger dog, uneasy with the situation, stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, aside from the sound of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the rapid temperature drop, from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, causing the hail to melt instantly on the warm pavement. As the skies started to clear, the sun peeked through, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped photos to share on Facebook, where friends and family marveled alongside me. The streets stayed silent for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm passed. Then, life resumed its usual pace, with moms and kids outside while dinner was prepared. This welcoming neighborhood is a delight for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love hearing the southern accent. My apartment, like all others here, has two bedrooms and two baths, though the interiors vary. Some are surprisingly small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the expansive field behind my place and heading to the pond, even though it's not for swimming. Deer sightings are common, and in the morning, the sound of a bullfrog fills the air. Living just forty minutes from Charlotte, it’s a fantastic place to call home. Roosters crow each morning from nearby farms, adding to the village-like atmosphere. We even have a donkey nearby who brays in the evening, reminding us of his presence. Finding this charming neighborhood was a stroke of luck.",
            "Having called this place home for about a decade, I feel I can share some insights. Initially, moving to my current neighborhood was difficult. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge was emotional, and I shed tears missing my old friends and surroundings. However, my parents made the decision with my sister and me in mind, seeking better housing and education opportunities. Our new area had a reputation for being more upscale compared to our previous home. Over time, I adjusted to the change, making both friends and a few rivals at school. My relationship with neighbors remained limited, except for the bond we formed with Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family, and I cherish our connection. A memorable event was attending Mr. Glen’s wedding when he remarried. It was a joyous occasion, filled with laughter and dancing, giving me a glimpse of what I hope to achieve in my own future—a successful life and a happy marriage. I even caught the garter, although not the bouquet! That night was particularly special as I danced with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, whom I haven't seen since. I wish her well in her journey. \n\nThe layout of our neighborhood is complex, but with GPS, I explore more freely now. My adventures have mostly been with friends like Kason and Curtis, with whom I spent countless hours playing video games and savoring life. Occasionally, I find solace in our local park, enjoying nature’s calming influence. There, I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and engage in some light swordplay with my bokken. These activities bring me joy. Our community also offers basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a while. It’s reassuring to know they’re available if I decide to return to the sport. My father introduced my best friend and me to tennis, and with Mr. Graves' coaching, we had our share of rigorous yet fun sessions. Reflecting on my time here, I realize there have been numerous memorable moments, but these stand out the most. I’m optimistic about what the future holds.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming little town that might not catch your eye at first glance but plays a pivotal role in the agricultural scene. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, a claim boldly displayed on its welcoming sign. This town is predominantly covered in farmland, with either peach orchards or cattle pastures dominating the landscape. Houses outside the central area are generously spaced, often two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to fend off the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Typically, these homes are set back from the main roads, with front fields dedicated to livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, a solitary traffic light presides over a four-way intersection, surrounded by the town’s only stores. For quick bites, there’s Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger joint. A pizzeria once existed here but has since closed its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is well-loved for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's lone, albeit pricey, grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Many residents prefer to drive to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for the bulk of their groceries, stopping at IGA for just a few items. Dollar General is the town's busiest spot, offering a wide range of everyday goods and bustling from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store run by a community-favorite lady, has been around for years and even offers delivery by two movers. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both the doctor's office and veterinary clinic are located away from the town's core, yet they are well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only elementary institution, with middle and high school students commuting to the next town. Though technically devoid of parks, plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family outings and attract visitors or new residents. While entertainment options are limited—no theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or diverse dining—the town’s simplicity is its charm, so much so that you could easily pass through without noticing!",
            "Residing in a typical suburban setting within a quaint town in Tennessee, my home is situated on a road that connects two state highways. This results in more traffic than preferred, yet the neighborhood remains mostly peaceful. The community is stable, with few residents moving in or out, allowing us to become well-acquainted with our neighbors. Many people spend their time tending to their yards and taking care of daily tasks. In the colder months, sledding down the hill on our adjacent street becomes a fun activity. Our house is located at the street's front corner, giving us a clear view of the daily comings and goings, and we recognize most of the vehicles. Unfamiliar cars catch our attention. Neighbors often walk, either for exercise or while walking their dogs, and children can be seen riding bikes, typical of suburban life. As we work from home, my wife and I, along with our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, spend a significant amount of time at home. Consequently, the neighbors have grown accustomed to our presence as well. We often enjoy playing outside, even if it's raining. Occasionally, we grill on our back deck, with the barbecue's aroma filling the air pleasantly. From March to October, lawnmowers are a common sound, as residents regularly maintain their yards. Originally a forested region, our area boasts abundant trees, providing shade but also a significant leaf cleanup during fall. The smell of burning leaves, which I find pleasant, signals the arrival of autumn. Recent winters have been mild, making the season feel like an extended fall. Our garage, located at the back of the house, means the front door is infrequently used unless someone rings the bell, an uncommon occurrence. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a serene atmosphere, though Thanksgiving and other occasions like Mother's Day and Christmas see an influx of visiting families, resulting in additional parked cars. Overall, I am fond of living here, and it would be ideal if it weren't a through street.",
            "Nestled in the heart of the high desert, my neighborhood is surrounded by endless stretches of arid land. The landscape is dominated by shades of brown, and unless you’ve lived here, it’s hard to grasp the monotony of this view. Spotting a green lawn is rare, and when you do, it’s clear that maintaining it requires considerable investment. In the 90s, when I first moved here, homes were widely spaced. That hasn’t changed much, although there are more new developments now. The area is gradually taking on a more urban feel, a trend seen in many places. The community is generally welcoming, though, like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood is surrounded by amiable elderly folks, which makes it quite pleasant. The local stores are mostly chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you'll have to venture farther away, as options like Whole Foods are scarce. Construction appears to be the dominant industry here, possibly because there's still plenty of undeveloped land. This prospect is somewhat unsettling for me, as I prefer the current state of things, having left a bustling city behind. My career is in construction as a drywall and T-bar installer. One aspect I appreciate about living here is the wildlife. Many are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty. The unique climate and terrain create challenging ecosystems that are home to diverse wildlife, which requires protection. Residents should take time to understand and coexist with these non-human neighbors. My family has embraced the local fauna; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects and are often outside trying to catch them. As for attractions, there are a few. Victorville offers families a chance to explore the desert environment, providing a unique experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a delightful mix of activities and entertainment. Nearby Wrightwood offers snowy mountain views and winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the evolution of Victorville’s society and industry.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response might stand out as a bit different. While many who answer this question are likely homeowners with their own distinct lives, my circumstances are slightly unconventional. I think of my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the people in my dormitory as my immediate community. I also consider the broader campus area as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with the traditional conceptions of a neighborhood. Just like any regular neighborhood, mine has residences, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by looking at the “houses” that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it’s important to outline the types of housing available in my area. There are three main housing types close by: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory buildings. First, in the apartments, typically 2-4 individuals occupy each room, with about 4-6 rooms on a floor. Most buildings feature about 2 floors, so roughly 20 people reside in each building. Next, there are the actual houses, which are accessible for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. These are generally 2-4 bedroom configurations, often occupied by alumni. However, these types of houses are less numerous, as they are not as space-efficient. Lastly, there are the typical dorm rooms that accommodate hundreds of students. In these, two people usually share a room, with some exceptions, making it the most prevalent form of housing in my neighborhood. With housing addressed, let’s move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity, and this is evident in my neighborhood’s demographics. There are individuals from various cultures and age groups living here. Most of the professional staff reside in the neighborhood’s houses, while newer students occupy dormitory-style housing and older students tend to live in apartment-style housing. It’s hard to capture the essence of the people in my neighborhood with just words, so it’s best to proceed to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as its own self-contained neighborhood, it boasts numerous stores and a single park. The stores consist of dining options you’d find in any other neighborhood, along with the school’s unique clothing and grocery outlets. As such, anything needed is readily available within the neighborhood’s limits! Furthermore, the park serves as a recreational area for the diverse community, maintained clean and safe by all neighborhood members!",
            "In my area, sidewalks are a rarity. The landscape slopes downward significantly, with my home perched atop the steepest hill in the vicinity. It's often dubbed the \"workout hill\" by locals due to the numerous joggers who tackle it as part of their exercise routine. With no sidewalks along my street, pedestrians share the road with vehicles. The road itself is riddled with potholes, making driving a bit dicey. Telephone and electrical wires crisscross above, giving off a frayed appearance. Frequent rainstorms lead to fallen branches that knock out power lines, resulting in a patchwork of repairs. Towering evergreen trees abound, though they're not universally loved. Many residents cut them down to clear the ocean view. That's why numerous homes are constructed high on the hill, featuring expansive glass facades to capture the bay's vista. The sunset casts a beautiful glow on the water, turning the sky a vibrant orange. However, cloudy skies prevail, often reducing sunlight to a mere haze. Overcast, damp days are the norm, encouraging moss to thrive on all surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, requiring a laborious three-hour cleaning session. Children are scarce in my neighborhood despite a school nearby; most residents are older and retired. Dogs are more common than kids, often lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leaving a door or window open might invite an unexpected canine visitor indoors—I once had to gently escort one out of my living room. Wild rabbits roam freely, much to the dismay of gardeners who find their lawns uprooted. My cats, however, enjoy hunting them, keeping their numbers in check. Our avian visitors include sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, until they're driven away by the resident crows. While there are no shops in the neighborhood, a trek downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The shore lacks a sandy beach, but the rocky edge invites stone-skipping. The bay isn't expansive; even through the mist, you can often see the far shore.",
            "If you intend to explore Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, rest assured that reaching it is quite straightforward! Public transit is highly accessible and remains a favored mode of travel in New York City. Bensonhurst retains an urban character, making you feel very much in the heart of New York City. As you wander through the area, expect to see a multitude of Asian shops dotting the landscape. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant increase in Asian residents in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll notice an Asian-owned establishment on nearly every block you traverse, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are quite popular among the locals due to their excellent food quality, lower prices, and notable convenience. For instance, there are four Asian supermarkets located within a two-minute walk from one another near my location, enhancing the ease of grocery shopping. While Bensonhurst has a strong Asian presence, it is, in fact, a diverse community with a mix of immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children. Many of the most significant and well-known businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there is a newly refurbished park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a spacious field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, playgrounds for children, swings, and even a water fountain for summertime fun. True to New York City, the parks here showcase remarkable diversity, providing a space where everyone can play and interact harmoniously. The neighborhood doesn't host many large corporate structures; instead, you will find co-op living buildings or condominium apartments, with two-family homes being the predominant type of residence. The community is generally friendly, albeit a bit loud. It's common to hear cars with booming music or engines revving as they pass by, which might serve as an unwelcome alarm clock. If you decide to visit at night, it's wise to stay alert. The area is relatively safe, but unpredictability can occur, with the potential for encounters with troublesome individuals. Personally, I've experienced bullying in this neighborhood in the past, including physical confrontations, though this was years ago. Recently, package theft has been an issue too. Despite regulations in New York City about cleaning up after dogs, compliance is lacking here. Each morning, you'll likely come across dog waste on your route to the train or the supermarket. My main annoyance is the frequent sight of dog waste on the sidewalks, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To get a sense of Portland, Oregon, you must first grasp the concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, painted on a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club (often pushing the boundaries of legality), is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s—a time when the city was less famous and costly, fostering vibrant and distinctive subcultures. For others, it serves as an invitation, a signal that in Portland, being called weird is a form of praise. Even with the arrival of wealthy Californians and the relentless construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always equate to being inclusive, but it does imply an openness to the unconventional. While Portland, like much of the country, depends heavily on goods from China and faces contemporary challenges, it boasts an array of ordinary elements. It has yoga sessions, hipsters, and corporate professionals. Perhaps the essence of weirdness here is a lighter approach to these norms. In my part of town, as in many others, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and during summer, free boxes. These boxes—often made of cardboard, but sometimes plastic—offer a serendipitous array of items someone no longer needs. More often than not, they hold a delightful surprise perfect for a passerby. Clothing and books are common finds, though almost anything might appear. This element of surprise walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the city's spirit. Or at least, it defines Portland for me. But I'm just one of the myriad of \"weird\" individuals here. Some locals would never consider picking their clothes from a street-side box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga sessions with live goats) or cheer for the Timbers, our soccer team. Portland is a melting pot of diverse passions and aspirations. Here, people chase their dreams, or perhaps fantasize about them while lingering too long at a bar. It's true that Portland faces challenges, such as drug issues often rooted in mental health struggles, exacerbated by the long, rainy, and cloudy seasons. Homelessness is another pressing issue, with no clear solution. The homeless are often drawn by Portland's relatively superior social services compared to other regions, though these services remain inadequate. The general populace oscillates between compassion and resentment. In this regard, we are quite typical.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast, always present. In the north, they observe each sunrise and sunset with unwavering patience. Even when I am so engrossed in the busyness of life that I neglect their presence, they remain unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress weighs heavily on me, they insist on being noticed, and in their presence, I find a calm for my restless mind and gain the strength to persevere, each day as it comes. When I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, it was the northern mountains that captured my attention. The university has its own allure with its impressive architecture, tranquil ponds, and lush trees, each holding a special place in my heart. Yet, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme in my affections. The town itself is charming, home to numerous cafés where countless hours were spent studying amidst the aroma of coffee. A short walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where old brick buildings create an atmosphere rich with history, giving this suburban town a lively energy comparable to its nearby urban counterpart. However, this bustling area quickly fades, allowing one to return to the peacefulness of small-town life by simply passing the library. This close-knit blend of contrasting environments offers the city an inviting charm, as if it’s inviting exploration. Here, one can easily form fond memories, each tied to different parts of the town. Whether it’s strolling past the aging swings in the park with friends after pulling an all-nighter or dashing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university, each experience is unique. Of course, like any place, it also holds its share of difficult memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as a place for both deep contemplation and tearful reflections during moments of existential crisis, something I am quite familiar with. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects going about their lives, each fulfilling some role, I often pondered my own purpose as I navigated the complexities of life. So, I would walk past the pond, through the park, and beyond the suburban homes until reaching a main street. It was then that the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees and painted the sky, and looking up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, unchanged as ever. The imposing mountains rose above the hazy blue and yellow sky, more prominent than any building on the horizon, and in their silent presence, they reignited my determination.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it. It's tucked away in a residential area behind a shopping center, not exactly where you'd expect people to live. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and head behind the hotels—mostly empty except for a few summer family reunions—you'll discover a lively community. This neighborhood, nestled on these streets, features several apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged in a row. The first set of apartments has garnered some media attention for unsavory issues, so we'll skip over those—appearances can often be misleading. Adjacent to those, and the next two complexes, lies a hidden world unknown to many locals. Opposite these complexes is a satellite campus of a community college, a tranquil collection of buildings where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning as early as 7 AM to start their day. The gates creak open, letting them in one at a time, while irritated drivers complain about the traffic delays on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. The center has cheerful porch seating and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Across the street, children play in the park, running across the grass while bees buzz around flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, scowling at skateboarders and nodding politely to teenage girls chatting by the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant in a strip mall offers affordable food yet remains uncrowded, next to a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor hibachi chicken all in one stop—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where park-goers often hold chilly cups topped with various treats, performing skateboard tricks and vaping as they see it as trendy. This neighborhood captures a slice of small-town America, a place in the unhurried South where time seems to stand still.",
            "The neighborhood I live in has its own unique charm. Most of the residences are standalone houses, but some have been cleverly divided into two attached units. My house features a modest yard at the front and a small driveway to the left. Like many others here, it harks back to an era when suburban living was synonymous with the American dream. Although this dream seems to be fading, my neighborhood and others like it continue to hold onto its essence, welcoming visitors with a reminder that the dream persists. People here may not feel as hopeful as before, and the gardens are not as meticulously maintained, yet driveways are still occupied by a car or two, and children continue to play as if their surroundings are their entire world. The public school, with its nearly 90-year history, stands as a beacon for the future generation, stirring nostalgia among older residents. While churches are sparsely scattered and often empty, the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has a distinct appearance, but they all share a common feel. There's a large supermarket named Super \"A,\" run by a Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the area. The majority of the population is African American. The streets are broad, allowing children to play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many families have lived here for generations, sharing stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but as interest in karate waned with the decline in related movies, it transformed into a pharmacy, a nod to the belief that medicine solves all, or so the saying goes. A small movie theater screens classic films at a lower price, shunned by the youth for its lack of new releases but cherished by older residents as an affordable night out without the kids. An expressway runs through our town, but the entry and exit ramps are in the neighboring town. A petition for an exit in our town was supported by the younger residents, while the elders opposed it, fearing it would disrupt our community, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the proposal. A new high school is underway, and we're in the process of selecting a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin, as it truly captures the spirit of our town.",
            "Living in a bustling metropolis means my neighborhood is a true melting pot of cultures and lifestyles. The residential zones are interspersed with commercial districts, featuring an array of businesses including offices, shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's no end to the new dining spots or shopping experiences, ranging from large, familiar retail chains to charming small boutiques. These smaller stores are increasingly drawing attention, not only in shopping centers but also along the streets, which are conveniently close to otherwise peaceful residential areas. Nearby parks offer a retreat where families often enjoy time with their children. My neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity, showcasing a vibrant mix of communities, such as a notable LGBTQ+ presence, an Orthodox Jewish enclave, and a group of former Soviet Union immigrants and refugees. Venturing slightly beyond, the cultural diversity blossoms further, with distinct areas like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia just a few miles away. However, navigating these distances can be time-consuming due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours, making a 10-mile journey last up to two hours. Despite the close proximity of various attractions, the city's vastness discourages walking as the main mode of transport, leading to notoriously congested roads and scarce parking. Ironically, the city is seeing a boom in construction, with new apartment complexes rising despite residents' concerns about increasing population density and traffic woes. Housing in the city is varied, with options ranging from large apartment complexes to smaller homes and condos. Some areas feature single-family houses, while others have duplexes, adding to the diversity of living arrangements. My immediate neighborhood reflects this variety, with people of different ages and backgrounds. Despite this, I am not well-acquainted with most of my neighbors, as the community isn't as close-knit as it once was. I fondly recall childhood days playing outdoors with my next-door neighbor and a few friends of similar age, but those interactions seem less common now.",
            "As we cruised by the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" anticipating her surprise at the vast emptiness surrounding us. Coming from a place where the grocery store was just a five-minute stroll away, she had never experienced such expansive open space. The sight of the endless cornfields was a revelation, and I shared with her what life was like growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she truly began to understand who I was and the environment that shaped me. Traveling down a narrow country road, we eventually reached a quarry brimming with water. Just beyond this landmark lies the modest neighborhood where I reside. The homes are primarily constructed of brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre, which residents take great pride in maintaining. Springtime brings an abundance of freshly planted flowers alongside the Midwestern trees that transform with the seasons. Driveways gleam with high-end Mercedes Benz cars, polished to shine beneath the midday sun after a thorough wash. As we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was outside, always with a welcoming smile. He often spends his days mowing his lawn, his voice harmonizing with the mower's hum. His presence brings joy to the neighborhood; despite aging and losing some sharpness, he remains genuine and intriguing. Previously a doctor, he now seamlessly blends with the grass on his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, we arrived at my home, where geese populate the side yard, playfully pursued by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, filling the air with the sounds of bullfrogs, flowing water, and the occasional cow's moo from distant farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched sanctuary of wild trees, herbs, and flowers. This is where I spent much of my youth, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them, always with a neighborhood friend nearby. Winters in our town can be harsh, yet they bring a unique beauty. The yard shifts from a green sea to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant blossoms now stand as stark skeletons. When snow graces us, a magical scene emerges overnight. The backyard becomes a canvas for snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. Our childhood quarrels were fought with snowballs, constructed in massive igloo-like forts built with branches, ready for battle. In our private winter world, we indulged in make-believe, a time when nothing else mattered. We were simply carefree kids, lost in our own adventures."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America lies my home, a small town in Michigan where vast farmlands transition seamlessly into quaint tourist destinations. This area lacks the bustling energy of large city malls, as well as chain stores like Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s—every destination requires a drive. Yet, the location is nothing short of stunning, as it's enveloped by water. The town is flanked by the breathtaking Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering countless beaches for a leisurely stroll or a refreshing dip. My neighborhood epitomizes the essence of a small town. Here, homes aren't crammed together or mass-produced; they are unique, with some having been modernized while others retain their vintage charm. Most houses boast full, visible basements and display a variety of colors with their classic aluminum siding. Each property often features a yard, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes gardens or animal enclosures. This community reflects the spirit of Middle America—diligent individuals nurturing or having nurtured families. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, while residents walk their dogs, cycle, or rollerblade. There's a strong sense of familiarity among neighbors, easily identifying who belongs and who doesn't. It’s common to exchange waves with someone grilling outside or share a friendly smile with a dog walker from another block. Lawns are well-maintained, free of autumn leaves, with neatly trimmed grass, plants, and bushes. While it may not be the most picturesque neighborhood, it exudes warmth and is clearly a wonderful place to raise a family. It's a quiet, peaceful, and secure environment. Though modest in appearance, it embodies the universal desire for a safe haven at the day’s end. Nearby, within walking distance, are the county sheriff's office and jail, the health department, and the city recycling center, all serving the local community. Close by are baseball and softball fields, where the sounds of announcers can be heard echoing names and scores. The small town airport is adjacent, and the gentle hum of small planes taking off and landing is a familiar backdrop. A local ice cream shop offers a sweet treat within strolling distance, and for those who enjoy a walk, downtown is accessible from our neighborhood. My children can easily bike to a park that’s just about eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The place where I reside can be summed up as a classic example of suburban living. In my specific neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner’s association is quite noticeable. As you enter, you’re greeted by rows of neatly kept single-family homes, a testament to the homeowner’s association’s efforts. The front lawns bear a striking similarity: small patches of manicured grass, decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Occasionally, you might see a few small trees. Each home comes with a two-car garage. As you drive around, you’ll observe the freshly paved roads, which are impressively maintained despite the many families who live here. You won’t encounter any potholes or damage. Most of the homes are one-story, although there are occasional two-story ones. Unlike typical single-family homes, we don’t have individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there’s a cluster of mailboxes at the street’s end, similar to an apartment setup. Residents use a key to access their mailbox, and there are two bigger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another result of the HOA’s regulations. My house is situated on the outskirts of a nearby city, making our neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, we have ample space for various activities. There are several community pools, accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and enclosed. Additionally, there are walking trails for dog walks or solo evening strolls. You don’t need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is expansive enough to jog around for a good workout. The community predominantly consists of retired individuals, creating a safe and watchful environment. There are also a few middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it’s surprisingly populous but still retains a small-town vibe. It provides nearly all the essential amenities. For instance, there’s one mall—not enormous, but functional. For me, it takes about 15 minutes to drive to key locations, but once there, a variety of stores are available. Everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to discount outlets with limited selections and minimal staff for cost efficiency can be found. Overall, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and fairly standard. We enjoy amenities like pools and trails, and while we’re not immediately adjacent to shopping areas, a short drive connects us to major retail chains.",
            "The first I learned about my apartment was through a podcast discussing missing persons cases. It came as a bit of a surprise. Most apartments in the vicinity are priced well over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had heard anything about the story. Perhaps it's the hardship. Some of my friends find themselves in tears before falling asleep. Life is costly, but over the years, we've mastered the art of thriftiness. You start to appreciate the musty aroma of toys from flea markets and clothes with mothball scents. As adults, we seem to smell less. You might take up smoking, or maybe you just grow used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market remains a constant. The scent of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It embeds itself in leather and lingers even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you begin at the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, yet you'd never hear it inside the thrifts. Regardless of the number of people or cars passing by, the stores remain quiet. They're perfect for losing an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood in. It's a city in development, they say. Although it hosts the headquarters of a major online commerce and delivery giant, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, and not much is expected from you. You can be solitary, silent, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's unlike the South, where showing concern signifies care. Here, people don't intrude into your life. You can maintain your privacy as long as you wish, and the city will ebb and flow like waves on a shore. It's a vibrant place to be. With a pianist living next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, our apartment isn't just a collection of strangers but a community of friends. We gather for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make an effort to keep my space tidy and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail for one another. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I reside in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, but people like my neighbors make me feel that I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a modest Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban reach of a sizable city. My neighborhood, positioned on the eastern side of town, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property prices here are quite low, with most homes being either rented or owned by individuals with limited incomes. Nonetheless, the area is far from unattractive or unpleasant. The people living nearby are generally amicable and often exchange smiles and greetings as I stroll down the street. Although crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of the town, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, a few violent incidents have occurred within a few blocks from my house, including several shootings and at least one fatality. Tragically, our next-door neighbors lost their son to a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family hasn't been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item disappearing from our porch when we forget to bring it in. The town itself has been deeply touched by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has swept across many regions of the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are several resources available in town to tackle this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for those supporting individuals with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts many positive qualities. My son's elementary school has an outstanding team, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Even with his special needs, he has not experienced any bullying, thanks to the school's incredibly positive environment, and he absolutely loves attending. We have a proactive PTO that organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational advancement. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family or child is regarded as \"less than\" due to financial constraints, and the costs associated with school fees, supplies, and field trips are quite reasonable. The City Council and staff have undertaken several beautification projects in town, including road resurfacing, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Regrettably, most of these improvements have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are located and most traffic flows. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, which is a sore point among my neighbors. On the whole, I enjoy residing in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options (ranging from small businesses to larger retail outlets) to satisfy my family's needs, and while our home might not be of high value, it is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot envision calling any other place home.",
            "My neighborhood is teeming with diverse cultural influences. Perched atop a hill, it's surrounded by buildings that hold historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite the old live theater, and just a block down the hill lies a fascinating arcade bar that attracts a variety of people during warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people eagerly waiting to enter. A few blocks in the opposite direction is the nearest city park, surprisingly large given its urban location. Surrounding the park is a concrete border with tall steps built into it. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals line the sidewalks and wide steps with their tents in neat rows. Though snow is rare, the heavy rain that falls mid-winter makes it challenging to stay warm. By setting their tents close together in the heart of the city rather than in more isolated areas, they manage to keep warmer and remain within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing facilities.\n\nWhat truly endears my city to me is not just its historical charm—the towering buildings and the architecture spread across the hills leading to the ocean—but the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, still carries stories from those times, even three decades later, when federal officials and the DEA attempted to clean up the streets. These stories persist through generations and reach newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the community works hard to maintain its cleanliness and stay informed about local happenings. There's an old saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this caution harks back to earlier times and carries the weight of social conditioning. Perhaps my ambiguous appearance helps me blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the persistent issues of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions rooted in ignorance and fear, even in a city celebrated as a cultural melting pot. No matter how far I travel, Hilltop remains my home. Walking those streets at night invigorates me, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners graciously keep their doors open a bit longer so I can charge my phone when there's no other refuge from the rain. It's a place where, even on the dreariest of nights, someone will stop, look me in the eye, hand me a five-dollar bill, and remind me that I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this area just as I was beginning eighth grade. Initially, forming friendships was a challenge, but eventually, I became close with a neighbor two doors down and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain vivid. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On warm weekends, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, the area is quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the residents; everyone respects your space unless assistance is needed. I've ordered numerous items online, and none have ever been taken from my porch, which makes me feel secure with my neighbors. A park is just a short walk away, where I've accumulated many memories. I've played various sports there, and despite a bad experience of getting an elbow to the nose while playing football, the positive memories outweigh the negative. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's young children, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park now evokes a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a mile, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian options. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food outlets are the most popular, as expected in most suburbs, along with numerous pizza places. The local stores provide all necessities, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco, a well-known Midwest grocery chain, all nearby. There's even an Indian-owned store for anyone interested in cooking or buying Indian food. I genuinely appreciate my neighborhood, especially after hearing about the difficulties others face with their neighbors on social media and the news. It makes me truly grateful for my own experience here.",
            "The neighborhood where I reside is conveniently close to the college I attend, which adds to the enjoyment of living here. The area is predominantly filled with apartment buildings, along with some restaurants and bars that offer a good time without being too pricey. One of the bars recently underwent a name change; though it’s pricier, the quality of service and drinks isn't disappointing. The community generally consists of friendly individuals, mostly college students or those with lower incomes, as the apartments are affordably priced. An elementary school nearby brings many children to the vicinity. While I haven't formed relationships with my neighbors, I'm not particularly inclined to, as they frequently smoke cannabis. This led the building management to install an air freshener unit opposite their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing yet somewhat offensive. Although the buildings around me often appear aged, they might have updated interiors. Further down the street are newer apartments that I dislike due to their poor construction despite high rents, which seem exploitative given their proximity to campus. About five minutes away is an inexpensive eatery that serves meals on paper plates, primarily using microwaved food. Across from it lies a gas station reputed to be an undesirable workplace. However, a city grant allowed for road improvements last summer, resulting in a wide sidewalk and landscaped medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment is surrounded by trees, though some were recently cut, leaving stumps, but there are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my apartment is a tree line, followed by another apartment complex. I reside on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, just behind, is less appealing with deteriorating sidewalks and rundown buildings, which the trees might be intended to conceal. Crime is mostly associated with an apartment complex on that street, although there's also considerable crime and a transient community across from me. Despite these issues, I find my living situation satisfactory due to its affordability and the abundance of nearby amenities. I particularly appreciate the university's walking distance and the two bus stops that facilitate easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, you'll find duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they resemble standalone homes. Each one sports a yellow hue, complemented by white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly with one another, often gathering in the evenings at the end of random driveways to chat while kids play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or kites. This simple camaraderie is a refreshing escape from our technology-driven lives, almost like a glimpse into the past. Surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds overhead, it’s quite picturesque. However, this season brought tornado warnings, and last night, for the first time, the sirens went off, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows. My larger dog, uneasy with the situation, stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, aside from the sound of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the rapid temperature drop, from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, causing the hail to melt instantly on the warm pavement. As the skies started to clear, the sun peeked through, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped photos to share on Facebook, where friends and family marveled alongside me. The streets stayed silent for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm passed. Then, life resumed its usual pace, with moms and kids outside while dinner was prepared. This welcoming neighborhood is a delight for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love hearing the southern accent. My apartment, like all others here, has two bedrooms and two baths, though the interiors vary. Some are surprisingly small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the expansive field behind my place and heading to the pond, even though it's not for swimming. Deer sightings are common, and in the morning, the sound of a bullfrog fills the air. Living just forty minutes from Charlotte, it’s a fantastic place to call home. Roosters crow each morning from nearby farms, adding to the village-like atmosphere. We even have a donkey nearby who brays in the evening, reminding us of his presence. Finding this charming neighborhood was a stroke of luck.",
            "Having called this place home for about a decade, I feel I can share some insights. Initially, moving to my current neighborhood was difficult. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge was emotional, and I shed tears missing my old friends and surroundings. However, my parents made the decision with my sister and me in mind, seeking better housing and education opportunities. Our new area had a reputation for being more upscale compared to our previous home. Over time, I adjusted to the change, making both friends and a few rivals at school. My relationship with neighbors remained limited, except for the bond we formed with Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family, and I cherish our connection. A memorable event was attending Mr. Glen’s wedding when he remarried. It was a joyous occasion, filled with laughter and dancing, giving me a glimpse of what I hope to achieve in my own future—a successful life and a happy marriage. I even caught the garter, although not the bouquet! That night was particularly special as I danced with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, whom I haven't seen since. I wish her well in her journey. \n\nThe layout of our neighborhood is complex, but with GPS, I explore more freely now. My adventures have mostly been with friends like Kason and Curtis, with whom I spent countless hours playing video games and savoring life. Occasionally, I find solace in our local park, enjoying nature’s calming influence. There, I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and engage in some light swordplay with my bokken. These activities bring me joy. Our community also offers basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a while. It’s reassuring to know they’re available if I decide to return to the sport. My father introduced my best friend and me to tennis, and with Mr. Graves' coaching, we had our share of rigorous yet fun sessions. Reflecting on my time here, I realize there have been numerous memorable moments, but these stand out the most. I’m optimistic about what the future holds.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming little town that might not catch your eye at first glance but plays a pivotal role in the agricultural scene. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, a claim boldly displayed on its welcoming sign. This town is predominantly covered in farmland, with either peach orchards or cattle pastures dominating the landscape. Houses outside the central area are generously spaced, often two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to fend off the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Typically, these homes are set back from the main roads, with front fields dedicated to livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, a solitary traffic light presides over a four-way intersection, surrounded by the town’s only stores. For quick bites, there’s Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger joint. A pizzeria once existed here but has since closed its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is well-loved for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's lone, albeit pricey, grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Many residents prefer to drive to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for the bulk of their groceries, stopping at IGA for just a few items. Dollar General is the town's busiest spot, offering a wide range of everyday goods and bustling from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store run by a community-favorite lady, has been around for years and even offers delivery by two movers. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both the doctor's office and veterinary clinic are located away from the town's core, yet they are well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only elementary institution, with middle and high school students commuting to the next town. Though technically devoid of parks, plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family outings and attract visitors or new residents. While entertainment options are limited—no theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or diverse dining—the town’s simplicity is its charm, so much so that you could easily pass through without noticing!",
            "Residing in a typical suburban setting within a quaint town in Tennessee, my home is situated on a road that connects two state highways. This results in more traffic than preferred, yet the neighborhood remains mostly peaceful. The community is stable, with few residents moving in or out, allowing us to become well-acquainted with our neighbors. Many people spend their time tending to their yards and taking care of daily tasks. In the colder months, sledding down the hill on our adjacent street becomes a fun activity. Our house is located at the street's front corner, giving us a clear view of the daily comings and goings, and we recognize most of the vehicles. Unfamiliar cars catch our attention. Neighbors often walk, either for exercise or while walking their dogs, and children can be seen riding bikes, typical of suburban life. As we work from home, my wife and I, along with our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, spend a significant amount of time at home. Consequently, the neighbors have grown accustomed to our presence as well. We often enjoy playing outside, even if it's raining. Occasionally, we grill on our back deck, with the barbecue's aroma filling the air pleasantly. From March to October, lawnmowers are a common sound, as residents regularly maintain their yards. Originally a forested region, our area boasts abundant trees, providing shade but also a significant leaf cleanup during fall. The smell of burning leaves, which I find pleasant, signals the arrival of autumn. Recent winters have been mild, making the season feel like an extended fall. Our garage, located at the back of the house, means the front door is infrequently used unless someone rings the bell, an uncommon occurrence. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a serene atmosphere, though Thanksgiving and other occasions like Mother's Day and Christmas see an influx of visiting families, resulting in additional parked cars. Overall, I am fond of living here, and it would be ideal if it weren't a through street.",
            "Nestled in the heart of the high desert, my neighborhood is surrounded by endless stretches of arid land. The landscape is dominated by shades of brown, and unless you’ve lived here, it’s hard to grasp the monotony of this view. Spotting a green lawn is rare, and when you do, it’s clear that maintaining it requires considerable investment. In the 90s, when I first moved here, homes were widely spaced. That hasn’t changed much, although there are more new developments now. The area is gradually taking on a more urban feel, a trend seen in many places. The community is generally welcoming, though, like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood is surrounded by amiable elderly folks, which makes it quite pleasant. The local stores are mostly chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you'll have to venture farther away, as options like Whole Foods are scarce. Construction appears to be the dominant industry here, possibly because there's still plenty of undeveloped land. This prospect is somewhat unsettling for me, as I prefer the current state of things, having left a bustling city behind. My career is in construction as a drywall and T-bar installer. One aspect I appreciate about living here is the wildlife. Many are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty. The unique climate and terrain create challenging ecosystems that are home to diverse wildlife, which requires protection. Residents should take time to understand and coexist with these non-human neighbors. My family has embraced the local fauna; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects and are often outside trying to catch them. As for attractions, there are a few. Victorville offers families a chance to explore the desert environment, providing a unique experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a delightful mix of activities and entertainment. Nearby Wrightwood offers snowy mountain views and winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the evolution of Victorville’s society and industry.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response might stand out as a bit different. While many who answer this question are likely homeowners with their own distinct lives, my circumstances are slightly unconventional. I think of my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the people in my dormitory as my immediate community. I also consider the broader campus area as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with the traditional conceptions of a neighborhood. Just like any regular neighborhood, mine has residences, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by looking at the “houses” that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it’s important to outline the types of housing available in my area. There are three main housing types close by: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory buildings. First, in the apartments, typically 2-4 individuals occupy each room, with about 4-6 rooms on a floor. Most buildings feature about 2 floors, so roughly 20 people reside in each building. Next, there are the actual houses, which are accessible for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. These are generally 2-4 bedroom configurations, often occupied by alumni. However, these types of houses are less numerous, as they are not as space-efficient. Lastly, there are the typical dorm rooms that accommodate hundreds of students. In these, two people usually share a room, with some exceptions, making it the most prevalent form of housing in my neighborhood. With housing addressed, let’s move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity, and this is evident in my neighborhood’s demographics. There are individuals from various cultures and age groups living here. Most of the professional staff reside in the neighborhood’s houses, while newer students occupy dormitory-style housing and older students tend to live in apartment-style housing. It’s hard to capture the essence of the people in my neighborhood with just words, so it’s best to proceed to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as its own self-contained neighborhood, it boasts numerous stores and a single park. The stores consist of dining options you’d find in any other neighborhood, along with the school’s unique clothing and grocery outlets. As such, anything needed is readily available within the neighborhood’s limits! Furthermore, the park serves as a recreational area for the diverse community, maintained clean and safe by all neighborhood members!",
            "In my area, sidewalks are a rarity. The landscape slopes downward significantly, with my home perched atop the steepest hill in the vicinity. It's often dubbed the \"workout hill\" by locals due to the numerous joggers who tackle it as part of their exercise routine. With no sidewalks along my street, pedestrians share the road with vehicles. The road itself is riddled with potholes, making driving a bit dicey. Telephone and electrical wires crisscross above, giving off a frayed appearance. Frequent rainstorms lead to fallen branches that knock out power lines, resulting in a patchwork of repairs. Towering evergreen trees abound, though they're not universally loved. Many residents cut them down to clear the ocean view. That's why numerous homes are constructed high on the hill, featuring expansive glass facades to capture the bay's vista. The sunset casts a beautiful glow on the water, turning the sky a vibrant orange. However, cloudy skies prevail, often reducing sunlight to a mere haze. Overcast, damp days are the norm, encouraging moss to thrive on all surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, requiring a laborious three-hour cleaning session. Children are scarce in my neighborhood despite a school nearby; most residents are older and retired. Dogs are more common than kids, often lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leaving a door or window open might invite an unexpected canine visitor indoors—I once had to gently escort one out of my living room. Wild rabbits roam freely, much to the dismay of gardeners who find their lawns uprooted. My cats, however, enjoy hunting them, keeping their numbers in check. Our avian visitors include sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, until they're driven away by the resident crows. While there are no shops in the neighborhood, a trek downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The shore lacks a sandy beach, but the rocky edge invites stone-skipping. The bay isn't expansive; even through the mist, you can often see the far shore.",
            "If you intend to explore Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, rest assured that reaching it is quite straightforward! Public transit is highly accessible and remains a favored mode of travel in New York City. Bensonhurst retains an urban character, making you feel very much in the heart of New York City. As you wander through the area, expect to see a multitude of Asian shops dotting the landscape. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant increase in Asian residents in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll notice an Asian-owned establishment on nearly every block you traverse, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are quite popular among the locals due to their excellent food quality, lower prices, and notable convenience. For instance, there are four Asian supermarkets located within a two-minute walk from one another near my location, enhancing the ease of grocery shopping. While Bensonhurst has a strong Asian presence, it is, in fact, a diverse community with a mix of immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children. Many of the most significant and well-known businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there is a newly refurbished park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a spacious field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, playgrounds for children, swings, and even a water fountain for summertime fun. True to New York City, the parks here showcase remarkable diversity, providing a space where everyone can play and interact harmoniously. The neighborhood doesn't host many large corporate structures; instead, you will find co-op living buildings or condominium apartments, with two-family homes being the predominant type of residence. The community is generally friendly, albeit a bit loud. It's common to hear cars with booming music or engines revving as they pass by, which might serve as an unwelcome alarm clock. If you decide to visit at night, it's wise to stay alert. The area is relatively safe, but unpredictability can occur, with the potential for encounters with troublesome individuals. Personally, I've experienced bullying in this neighborhood in the past, including physical confrontations, though this was years ago. Recently, package theft has been an issue too. Despite regulations in New York City about cleaning up after dogs, compliance is lacking here. Each morning, you'll likely come across dog waste on your route to the train or the supermarket. My main annoyance is the frequent sight of dog waste on the sidewalks, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To get a sense of Portland, Oregon, you must first grasp the concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, painted on a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club (often pushing the boundaries of legality), is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s—a time when the city was less famous and costly, fostering vibrant and distinctive subcultures. For others, it serves as an invitation, a signal that in Portland, being called weird is a form of praise. Even with the arrival of wealthy Californians and the relentless construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always equate to being inclusive, but it does imply an openness to the unconventional. While Portland, like much of the country, depends heavily on goods from China and faces contemporary challenges, it boasts an array of ordinary elements. It has yoga sessions, hipsters, and corporate professionals. Perhaps the essence of weirdness here is a lighter approach to these norms. In my part of town, as in many others, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and during summer, free boxes. These boxes—often made of cardboard, but sometimes plastic—offer a serendipitous array of items someone no longer needs. More often than not, they hold a delightful surprise perfect for a passerby. Clothing and books are common finds, though almost anything might appear. This element of surprise walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the city's spirit. Or at least, it defines Portland for me. But I'm just one of the myriad of \"weird\" individuals here. Some locals would never consider picking their clothes from a street-side box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga sessions with live goats) or cheer for the Timbers, our soccer team. Portland is a melting pot of diverse passions and aspirations. Here, people chase their dreams, or perhaps fantasize about them while lingering too long at a bar. It's true that Portland faces challenges, such as drug issues often rooted in mental health struggles, exacerbated by the long, rainy, and cloudy seasons. Homelessness is another pressing issue, with no clear solution. The homeless are often drawn by Portland's relatively superior social services compared to other regions, though these services remain inadequate. The general populace oscillates between compassion and resentment. In this regard, we are quite typical.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast, always present. In the north, they observe each sunrise and sunset with unwavering patience. Even when I am so engrossed in the busyness of life that I neglect their presence, they remain unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress weighs heavily on me, they insist on being noticed, and in their presence, I find a calm for my restless mind and gain the strength to persevere, each day as it comes. When I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, it was the northern mountains that captured my attention. The university has its own allure with its impressive architecture, tranquil ponds, and lush trees, each holding a special place in my heart. Yet, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme in my affections. The town itself is charming, home to numerous cafés where countless hours were spent studying amidst the aroma of coffee. A short walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where old brick buildings create an atmosphere rich with history, giving this suburban town a lively energy comparable to its nearby urban counterpart. However, this bustling area quickly fades, allowing one to return to the peacefulness of small-town life by simply passing the library. This close-knit blend of contrasting environments offers the city an inviting charm, as if it’s inviting exploration. Here, one can easily form fond memories, each tied to different parts of the town. Whether it’s strolling past the aging swings in the park with friends after pulling an all-nighter or dashing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university, each experience is unique. Of course, like any place, it also holds its share of difficult memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as a place for both deep contemplation and tearful reflections during moments of existential crisis, something I am quite familiar with. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects going about their lives, each fulfilling some role, I often pondered my own purpose as I navigated the complexities of life. So, I would walk past the pond, through the park, and beyond the suburban homes until reaching a main street. It was then that the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees and painted the sky, and looking up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, unchanged as ever. The imposing mountains rose above the hazy blue and yellow sky, more prominent than any building on the horizon, and in their silent presence, they reignited my determination.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it. It's tucked away in a residential area behind a shopping center, not exactly where you'd expect people to live. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and head behind the hotels—mostly empty except for a few summer family reunions—you'll discover a lively community. This neighborhood, nestled on these streets, features several apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged in a row. The first set of apartments has garnered some media attention for unsavory issues, so we'll skip over those—appearances can often be misleading. Adjacent to those, and the next two complexes, lies a hidden world unknown to many locals. Opposite these complexes is a satellite campus of a community college, a tranquil collection of buildings where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning as early as 7 AM to start their day. The gates creak open, letting them in one at a time, while irritated drivers complain about the traffic delays on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. The center has cheerful porch seating and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Across the street, children play in the park, running across the grass while bees buzz around flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, scowling at skateboarders and nodding politely to teenage girls chatting by the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant in a strip mall offers affordable food yet remains uncrowded, next to a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor hibachi chicken all in one stop—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where park-goers often hold chilly cups topped with various treats, performing skateboard tricks and vaping as they see it as trendy. This neighborhood captures a slice of small-town America, a place in the unhurried South where time seems to stand still.",
            "The neighborhood I live in has its own unique charm. Most of the residences are standalone houses, but some have been cleverly divided into two attached units. My house features a modest yard at the front and a small driveway to the left. Like many others here, it harks back to an era when suburban living was synonymous with the American dream. Although this dream seems to be fading, my neighborhood and others like it continue to hold onto its essence, welcoming visitors with a reminder that the dream persists. People here may not feel as hopeful as before, and the gardens are not as meticulously maintained, yet driveways are still occupied by a car or two, and children continue to play as if their surroundings are their entire world. The public school, with its nearly 90-year history, stands as a beacon for the future generation, stirring nostalgia among older residents. While churches are sparsely scattered and often empty, the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has a distinct appearance, but they all share a common feel. There's a large supermarket named Super \"A,\" run by a Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the area. The majority of the population is African American. The streets are broad, allowing children to play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many families have lived here for generations, sharing stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but as interest in karate waned with the decline in related movies, it transformed into a pharmacy, a nod to the belief that medicine solves all, or so the saying goes. A small movie theater screens classic films at a lower price, shunned by the youth for its lack of new releases but cherished by older residents as an affordable night out without the kids. An expressway runs through our town, but the entry and exit ramps are in the neighboring town. A petition for an exit in our town was supported by the younger residents, while the elders opposed it, fearing it would disrupt our community, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the proposal. A new high school is underway, and we're in the process of selecting a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin, as it truly captures the spirit of our town.",
            "Living in a bustling metropolis means my neighborhood is a true melting pot of cultures and lifestyles. The residential zones are interspersed with commercial districts, featuring an array of businesses including offices, shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's no end to the new dining spots or shopping experiences, ranging from large, familiar retail chains to charming small boutiques. These smaller stores are increasingly drawing attention, not only in shopping centers but also along the streets, which are conveniently close to otherwise peaceful residential areas. Nearby parks offer a retreat where families often enjoy time with their children. My neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity, showcasing a vibrant mix of communities, such as a notable LGBTQ+ presence, an Orthodox Jewish enclave, and a group of former Soviet Union immigrants and refugees. Venturing slightly beyond, the cultural diversity blossoms further, with distinct areas like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia just a few miles away. However, navigating these distances can be time-consuming due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours, making a 10-mile journey last up to two hours. Despite the close proximity of various attractions, the city's vastness discourages walking as the main mode of transport, leading to notoriously congested roads and scarce parking. Ironically, the city is seeing a boom in construction, with new apartment complexes rising despite residents' concerns about increasing population density and traffic woes. Housing in the city is varied, with options ranging from large apartment complexes to smaller homes and condos. Some areas feature single-family houses, while others have duplexes, adding to the diversity of living arrangements. My immediate neighborhood reflects this variety, with people of different ages and backgrounds. Despite this, I am not well-acquainted with most of my neighbors, as the community isn't as close-knit as it once was. I fondly recall childhood days playing outdoors with my next-door neighbor and a few friends of similar age, but those interactions seem less common now.",
            "As we cruised by the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" anticipating her surprise at the vast emptiness surrounding us. Coming from a place where the grocery store was just a five-minute stroll away, she had never experienced such expansive open space. The sight of the endless cornfields was a revelation, and I shared with her what life was like growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she truly began to understand who I was and the environment that shaped me. Traveling down a narrow country road, we eventually reached a quarry brimming with water. Just beyond this landmark lies the modest neighborhood where I reside. The homes are primarily constructed of brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre, which residents take great pride in maintaining. Springtime brings an abundance of freshly planted flowers alongside the Midwestern trees that transform with the seasons. Driveways gleam with high-end Mercedes Benz cars, polished to shine beneath the midday sun after a thorough wash. As we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was outside, always with a welcoming smile. He often spends his days mowing his lawn, his voice harmonizing with the mower's hum. His presence brings joy to the neighborhood; despite aging and losing some sharpness, he remains genuine and intriguing. Previously a doctor, he now seamlessly blends with the grass on his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, we arrived at my home, where geese populate the side yard, playfully pursued by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, filling the air with the sounds of bullfrogs, flowing water, and the occasional cow's moo from distant farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched sanctuary of wild trees, herbs, and flowers. This is where I spent much of my youth, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them, always with a neighborhood friend nearby. Winters in our town can be harsh, yet they bring a unique beauty. The yard shifts from a green sea to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant blossoms now stand as stark skeletons. When snow graces us, a magical scene emerges overnight. The backyard becomes a canvas for snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. Our childhood quarrels were fought with snowballs, constructed in massive igloo-like forts built with branches, ready for battle. In our private winter world, we indulged in make-believe, a time when nothing else mattered. We were simply carefree kids, lost in our own adventures."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America lies my home, a small town in Michigan where vast farmlands transition seamlessly into quaint tourist destinations. This area lacks the bustling energy of large city malls, as well as chain stores like Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s—every destination requires a drive. Yet, the location is nothing short of stunning, as it's enveloped by water. The town is flanked by the breathtaking Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering countless beaches for a leisurely stroll or a refreshing dip. My neighborhood epitomizes the essence of a small town. Here, homes aren't crammed together or mass-produced; they are unique, with some having been modernized while others retain their vintage charm. Most houses boast full, visible basements and display a variety of colors with their classic aluminum siding. Each property often features a yard, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes gardens or animal enclosures. This community reflects the spirit of Middle America—diligent individuals nurturing or having nurtured families. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, while residents walk their dogs, cycle, or rollerblade. There's a strong sense of familiarity among neighbors, easily identifying who belongs and who doesn't. It’s common to exchange waves with someone grilling outside or share a friendly smile with a dog walker from another block. Lawns are well-maintained, free of autumn leaves, with neatly trimmed grass, plants, and bushes. While it may not be the most picturesque neighborhood, it exudes warmth and is clearly a wonderful place to raise a family. It's a quiet, peaceful, and secure environment. Though modest in appearance, it embodies the universal desire for a safe haven at the day’s end. Nearby, within walking distance, are the county sheriff's office and jail, the health department, and the city recycling center, all serving the local community. Close by are baseball and softball fields, where the sounds of announcers can be heard echoing names and scores. The small town airport is adjacent, and the gentle hum of small planes taking off and landing is a familiar backdrop. A local ice cream shop offers a sweet treat within strolling distance, and for those who enjoy a walk, downtown is accessible from our neighborhood. My children can easily bike to a park that’s just about eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The place where I reside can be summed up as a classic example of suburban living. In my specific neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner’s association is quite noticeable. As you enter, you’re greeted by rows of neatly kept single-family homes, a testament to the homeowner’s association’s efforts. The front lawns bear a striking similarity: small patches of manicured grass, decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Occasionally, you might see a few small trees. Each home comes with a two-car garage. As you drive around, you’ll observe the freshly paved roads, which are impressively maintained despite the many families who live here. You won’t encounter any potholes or damage. Most of the homes are one-story, although there are occasional two-story ones. Unlike typical single-family homes, we don’t have individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there’s a cluster of mailboxes at the street’s end, similar to an apartment setup. Residents use a key to access their mailbox, and there are two bigger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another result of the HOA’s regulations. My house is situated on the outskirts of a nearby city, making our neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, we have ample space for various activities. There are several community pools, accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and enclosed. Additionally, there are walking trails for dog walks or solo evening strolls. You don’t need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is expansive enough to jog around for a good workout. The community predominantly consists of retired individuals, creating a safe and watchful environment. There are also a few middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it’s surprisingly populous but still retains a small-town vibe. It provides nearly all the essential amenities. For instance, there’s one mall—not enormous, but functional. For me, it takes about 15 minutes to drive to key locations, but once there, a variety of stores are available. Everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to discount outlets with limited selections and minimal staff for cost efficiency can be found. Overall, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and fairly standard. We enjoy amenities like pools and trails, and while we’re not immediately adjacent to shopping areas, a short drive connects us to major retail chains.",
            "The first I learned about my apartment was through a podcast discussing missing persons cases. It came as a bit of a surprise. Most apartments in the vicinity are priced well over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had heard anything about the story. Perhaps it's the hardship. Some of my friends find themselves in tears before falling asleep. Life is costly, but over the years, we've mastered the art of thriftiness. You start to appreciate the musty aroma of toys from flea markets and clothes with mothball scents. As adults, we seem to smell less. You might take up smoking, or maybe you just grow used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market remains a constant. The scent of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It embeds itself in leather and lingers even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you begin at the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, yet you'd never hear it inside the thrifts. Regardless of the number of people or cars passing by, the stores remain quiet. They're perfect for losing an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood in. It's a city in development, they say. Although it hosts the headquarters of a major online commerce and delivery giant, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, and not much is expected from you. You can be solitary, silent, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's unlike the South, where showing concern signifies care. Here, people don't intrude into your life. You can maintain your privacy as long as you wish, and the city will ebb and flow like waves on a shore. It's a vibrant place to be. With a pianist living next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, our apartment isn't just a collection of strangers but a community of friends. We gather for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make an effort to keep my space tidy and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail for one another. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I reside in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, but people like my neighbors make me feel that I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a modest Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban reach of a sizable city. My neighborhood, positioned on the eastern side of town, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property prices here are quite low, with most homes being either rented or owned by individuals with limited incomes. Nonetheless, the area is far from unattractive or unpleasant. The people living nearby are generally amicable and often exchange smiles and greetings as I stroll down the street. Although crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of the town, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, a few violent incidents have occurred within a few blocks from my house, including several shootings and at least one fatality. Tragically, our next-door neighbors lost their son to a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family hasn't been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item disappearing from our porch when we forget to bring it in. The town itself has been deeply touched by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has swept across many regions of the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are several resources available in town to tackle this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for those supporting individuals with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts many positive qualities. My son's elementary school has an outstanding team, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Even with his special needs, he has not experienced any bullying, thanks to the school's incredibly positive environment, and he absolutely loves attending. We have a proactive PTO that organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational advancement. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family or child is regarded as \"less than\" due to financial constraints, and the costs associated with school fees, supplies, and field trips are quite reasonable. The City Council and staff have undertaken several beautification projects in town, including road resurfacing, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Regrettably, most of these improvements have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are located and most traffic flows. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, which is a sore point among my neighbors. On the whole, I enjoy residing in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options (ranging from small businesses to larger retail outlets) to satisfy my family's needs, and while our home might not be of high value, it is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot envision calling any other place home.",
            "My neighborhood is teeming with diverse cultural influences. Perched atop a hill, it's surrounded by buildings that hold historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite the old live theater, and just a block down the hill lies a fascinating arcade bar that attracts a variety of people during warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people eagerly waiting to enter. A few blocks in the opposite direction is the nearest city park, surprisingly large given its urban location. Surrounding the park is a concrete border with tall steps built into it. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals line the sidewalks and wide steps with their tents in neat rows. Though snow is rare, the heavy rain that falls mid-winter makes it challenging to stay warm. By setting their tents close together in the heart of the city rather than in more isolated areas, they manage to keep warmer and remain within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing facilities.\n\nWhat truly endears my city to me is not just its historical charm—the towering buildings and the architecture spread across the hills leading to the ocean—but the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, still carries stories from those times, even three decades later, when federal officials and the DEA attempted to clean up the streets. These stories persist through generations and reach newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the community works hard to maintain its cleanliness and stay informed about local happenings. There's an old saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this caution harks back to earlier times and carries the weight of social conditioning. Perhaps my ambiguous appearance helps me blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the persistent issues of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions rooted in ignorance and fear, even in a city celebrated as a cultural melting pot. No matter how far I travel, Hilltop remains my home. Walking those streets at night invigorates me, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners graciously keep their doors open a bit longer so I can charge my phone when there's no other refuge from the rain. It's a place where, even on the dreariest of nights, someone will stop, look me in the eye, hand me a five-dollar bill, and remind me that I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this area just as I was beginning eighth grade. Initially, forming friendships was a challenge, but eventually, I became close with a neighbor two doors down and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain vivid. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On warm weekends, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, the area is quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the residents; everyone respects your space unless assistance is needed. I've ordered numerous items online, and none have ever been taken from my porch, which makes me feel secure with my neighbors. A park is just a short walk away, where I've accumulated many memories. I've played various sports there, and despite a bad experience of getting an elbow to the nose while playing football, the positive memories outweigh the negative. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's young children, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park now evokes a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a mile, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian options. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food outlets are the most popular, as expected in most suburbs, along with numerous pizza places. The local stores provide all necessities, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco, a well-known Midwest grocery chain, all nearby. There's even an Indian-owned store for anyone interested in cooking or buying Indian food. I genuinely appreciate my neighborhood, especially after hearing about the difficulties others face with their neighbors on social media and the news. It makes me truly grateful for my own experience here.",
            "The neighborhood where I reside is conveniently close to the college I attend, which adds to the enjoyment of living here. The area is predominantly filled with apartment buildings, along with some restaurants and bars that offer a good time without being too pricey. One of the bars recently underwent a name change; though it’s pricier, the quality of service and drinks isn't disappointing. The community generally consists of friendly individuals, mostly college students or those with lower incomes, as the apartments are affordably priced. An elementary school nearby brings many children to the vicinity. While I haven't formed relationships with my neighbors, I'm not particularly inclined to, as they frequently smoke cannabis. This led the building management to install an air freshener unit opposite their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing yet somewhat offensive. Although the buildings around me often appear aged, they might have updated interiors. Further down the street are newer apartments that I dislike due to their poor construction despite high rents, which seem exploitative given their proximity to campus. About five minutes away is an inexpensive eatery that serves meals on paper plates, primarily using microwaved food. Across from it lies a gas station reputed to be an undesirable workplace. However, a city grant allowed for road improvements last summer, resulting in a wide sidewalk and landscaped medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment is surrounded by trees, though some were recently cut, leaving stumps, but there are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my apartment is a tree line, followed by another apartment complex. I reside on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, just behind, is less appealing with deteriorating sidewalks and rundown buildings, which the trees might be intended to conceal. Crime is mostly associated with an apartment complex on that street, although there's also considerable crime and a transient community across from me. Despite these issues, I find my living situation satisfactory due to its affordability and the abundance of nearby amenities. I particularly appreciate the university's walking distance and the two bus stops that facilitate easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, you'll find duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they resemble standalone homes. Each one sports a yellow hue, complemented by white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly with one another, often gathering in the evenings at the end of random driveways to chat while kids play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or kites. This simple camaraderie is a refreshing escape from our technology-driven lives, almost like a glimpse into the past. Surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds overhead, it’s quite picturesque. However, this season brought tornado warnings, and last night, for the first time, the sirens went off, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows. My larger dog, uneasy with the situation, stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, aside from the sound of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the rapid temperature drop, from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, causing the hail to melt instantly on the warm pavement. As the skies started to clear, the sun peeked through, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped photos to share on Facebook, where friends and family marveled alongside me. The streets stayed silent for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm passed. Then, life resumed its usual pace, with moms and kids outside while dinner was prepared. This welcoming neighborhood is a delight for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love hearing the southern accent. My apartment, like all others here, has two bedrooms and two baths, though the interiors vary. Some are surprisingly small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the expansive field behind my place and heading to the pond, even though it's not for swimming. Deer sightings are common, and in the morning, the sound of a bullfrog fills the air. Living just forty minutes from Charlotte, it’s a fantastic place to call home. Roosters crow each morning from nearby farms, adding to the village-like atmosphere. We even have a donkey nearby who brays in the evening, reminding us of his presence. Finding this charming neighborhood was a stroke of luck.",
            "Having called this place home for about a decade, I feel I can share some insights. Initially, moving to my current neighborhood was difficult. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge was emotional, and I shed tears missing my old friends and surroundings. However, my parents made the decision with my sister and me in mind, seeking better housing and education opportunities. Our new area had a reputation for being more upscale compared to our previous home. Over time, I adjusted to the change, making both friends and a few rivals at school. My relationship with neighbors remained limited, except for the bond we formed with Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family, and I cherish our connection. A memorable event was attending Mr. Glen’s wedding when he remarried. It was a joyous occasion, filled with laughter and dancing, giving me a glimpse of what I hope to achieve in my own future—a successful life and a happy marriage. I even caught the garter, although not the bouquet! That night was particularly special as I danced with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, whom I haven't seen since. I wish her well in her journey. \n\nThe layout of our neighborhood is complex, but with GPS, I explore more freely now. My adventures have mostly been with friends like Kason and Curtis, with whom I spent countless hours playing video games and savoring life. Occasionally, I find solace in our local park, enjoying nature’s calming influence. There, I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and engage in some light swordplay with my bokken. These activities bring me joy. Our community also offers basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a while. It’s reassuring to know they’re available if I decide to return to the sport. My father introduced my best friend and me to tennis, and with Mr. Graves' coaching, we had our share of rigorous yet fun sessions. Reflecting on my time here, I realize there have been numerous memorable moments, but these stand out the most. I’m optimistic about what the future holds.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming little town that might not catch your eye at first glance but plays a pivotal role in the agricultural scene. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, a claim boldly displayed on its welcoming sign. This town is predominantly covered in farmland, with either peach orchards or cattle pastures dominating the landscape. Houses outside the central area are generously spaced, often two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to fend off the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Typically, these homes are set back from the main roads, with front fields dedicated to livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, a solitary traffic light presides over a four-way intersection, surrounded by the town’s only stores. For quick bites, there’s Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger joint. A pizzeria once existed here but has since closed its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is well-loved for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's lone, albeit pricey, grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Many residents prefer to drive to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for the bulk of their groceries, stopping at IGA for just a few items. Dollar General is the town's busiest spot, offering a wide range of everyday goods and bustling from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store run by a community-favorite lady, has been around for years and even offers delivery by two movers. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both the doctor's office and veterinary clinic are located away from the town's core, yet they are well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only elementary institution, with middle and high school students commuting to the next town. Though technically devoid of parks, plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family outings and attract visitors or new residents. While entertainment options are limited—no theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or diverse dining—the town’s simplicity is its charm, so much so that you could easily pass through without noticing!",
            "Residing in a typical suburban setting within a quaint town in Tennessee, my home is situated on a road that connects two state highways. This results in more traffic than preferred, yet the neighborhood remains mostly peaceful. The community is stable, with few residents moving in or out, allowing us to become well-acquainted with our neighbors. Many people spend their time tending to their yards and taking care of daily tasks. In the colder months, sledding down the hill on our adjacent street becomes a fun activity. Our house is located at the street's front corner, giving us a clear view of the daily comings and goings, and we recognize most of the vehicles. Unfamiliar cars catch our attention. Neighbors often walk, either for exercise or while walking their dogs, and children can be seen riding bikes, typical of suburban life. As we work from home, my wife and I, along with our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, spend a significant amount of time at home. Consequently, the neighbors have grown accustomed to our presence as well. We often enjoy playing outside, even if it's raining. Occasionally, we grill on our back deck, with the barbecue's aroma filling the air pleasantly. From March to October, lawnmowers are a common sound, as residents regularly maintain their yards. Originally a forested region, our area boasts abundant trees, providing shade but also a significant leaf cleanup during fall. The smell of burning leaves, which I find pleasant, signals the arrival of autumn. Recent winters have been mild, making the season feel like an extended fall. Our garage, located at the back of the house, means the front door is infrequently used unless someone rings the bell, an uncommon occurrence. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a serene atmosphere, though Thanksgiving and other occasions like Mother's Day and Christmas see an influx of visiting families, resulting in additional parked cars. Overall, I am fond of living here, and it would be ideal if it weren't a through street.",
            "Nestled in the heart of the high desert, my neighborhood is surrounded by endless stretches of arid land. The landscape is dominated by shades of brown, and unless you’ve lived here, it’s hard to grasp the monotony of this view. Spotting a green lawn is rare, and when you do, it’s clear that maintaining it requires considerable investment. In the 90s, when I first moved here, homes were widely spaced. That hasn’t changed much, although there are more new developments now. The area is gradually taking on a more urban feel, a trend seen in many places. The community is generally welcoming, though, like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood is surrounded by amiable elderly folks, which makes it quite pleasant. The local stores are mostly chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you'll have to venture farther away, as options like Whole Foods are scarce. Construction appears to be the dominant industry here, possibly because there's still plenty of undeveloped land. This prospect is somewhat unsettling for me, as I prefer the current state of things, having left a bustling city behind. My career is in construction as a drywall and T-bar installer. One aspect I appreciate about living here is the wildlife. Many are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty. The unique climate and terrain create challenging ecosystems that are home to diverse wildlife, which requires protection. Residents should take time to understand and coexist with these non-human neighbors. My family has embraced the local fauna; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects and are often outside trying to catch them. As for attractions, there are a few. Victorville offers families a chance to explore the desert environment, providing a unique experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a delightful mix of activities and entertainment. Nearby Wrightwood offers snowy mountain views and winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the evolution of Victorville’s society and industry.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response might stand out as a bit different. While many who answer this question are likely homeowners with their own distinct lives, my circumstances are slightly unconventional. I think of my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the people in my dormitory as my immediate community. I also consider the broader campus area as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with the traditional conceptions of a neighborhood. Just like any regular neighborhood, mine has residences, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by looking at the “houses” that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it’s important to outline the types of housing available in my area. There are three main housing types close by: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory buildings. First, in the apartments, typically 2-4 individuals occupy each room, with about 4-6 rooms on a floor. Most buildings feature about 2 floors, so roughly 20 people reside in each building. Next, there are the actual houses, which are accessible for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. These are generally 2-4 bedroom configurations, often occupied by alumni. However, these types of houses are less numerous, as they are not as space-efficient. Lastly, there are the typical dorm rooms that accommodate hundreds of students. In these, two people usually share a room, with some exceptions, making it the most prevalent form of housing in my neighborhood. With housing addressed, let’s move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity, and this is evident in my neighborhood’s demographics. There are individuals from various cultures and age groups living here. Most of the professional staff reside in the neighborhood’s houses, while newer students occupy dormitory-style housing and older students tend to live in apartment-style housing. It’s hard to capture the essence of the people in my neighborhood with just words, so it’s best to proceed to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as its own self-contained neighborhood, it boasts numerous stores and a single park. The stores consist of dining options you’d find in any other neighborhood, along with the school’s unique clothing and grocery outlets. As such, anything needed is readily available within the neighborhood’s limits! Furthermore, the park serves as a recreational area for the diverse community, maintained clean and safe by all neighborhood members!",
            "In my area, sidewalks are a rarity. The landscape slopes downward significantly, with my home perched atop the steepest hill in the vicinity. It's often dubbed the \"workout hill\" by locals due to the numerous joggers who tackle it as part of their exercise routine. With no sidewalks along my street, pedestrians share the road with vehicles. The road itself is riddled with potholes, making driving a bit dicey. Telephone and electrical wires crisscross above, giving off a frayed appearance. Frequent rainstorms lead to fallen branches that knock out power lines, resulting in a patchwork of repairs. Towering evergreen trees abound, though they're not universally loved. Many residents cut them down to clear the ocean view. That's why numerous homes are constructed high on the hill, featuring expansive glass facades to capture the bay's vista. The sunset casts a beautiful glow on the water, turning the sky a vibrant orange. However, cloudy skies prevail, often reducing sunlight to a mere haze. Overcast, damp days are the norm, encouraging moss to thrive on all surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, requiring a laborious three-hour cleaning session. Children are scarce in my neighborhood despite a school nearby; most residents are older and retired. Dogs are more common than kids, often lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leaving a door or window open might invite an unexpected canine visitor indoors—I once had to gently escort one out of my living room. Wild rabbits roam freely, much to the dismay of gardeners who find their lawns uprooted. My cats, however, enjoy hunting them, keeping their numbers in check. Our avian visitors include sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, until they're driven away by the resident crows. While there are no shops in the neighborhood, a trek downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The shore lacks a sandy beach, but the rocky edge invites stone-skipping. The bay isn't expansive; even through the mist, you can often see the far shore.",
            "If you intend to explore Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, rest assured that reaching it is quite straightforward! Public transit is highly accessible and remains a favored mode of travel in New York City. Bensonhurst retains an urban character, making you feel very much in the heart of New York City. As you wander through the area, expect to see a multitude of Asian shops dotting the landscape. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant increase in Asian residents in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll notice an Asian-owned establishment on nearly every block you traverse, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are quite popular among the locals due to their excellent food quality, lower prices, and notable convenience. For instance, there are four Asian supermarkets located within a two-minute walk from one another near my location, enhancing the ease of grocery shopping. While Bensonhurst has a strong Asian presence, it is, in fact, a diverse community with a mix of immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children. Many of the most significant and well-known businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there is a newly refurbished park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a spacious field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, playgrounds for children, swings, and even a water fountain for summertime fun. True to New York City, the parks here showcase remarkable diversity, providing a space where everyone can play and interact harmoniously. The neighborhood doesn't host many large corporate structures; instead, you will find co-op living buildings or condominium apartments, with two-family homes being the predominant type of residence. The community is generally friendly, albeit a bit loud. It's common to hear cars with booming music or engines revving as they pass by, which might serve as an unwelcome alarm clock. If you decide to visit at night, it's wise to stay alert. The area is relatively safe, but unpredictability can occur, with the potential for encounters with troublesome individuals. Personally, I've experienced bullying in this neighborhood in the past, including physical confrontations, though this was years ago. Recently, package theft has been an issue too. Despite regulations in New York City about cleaning up after dogs, compliance is lacking here. Each morning, you'll likely come across dog waste on your route to the train or the supermarket. My main annoyance is the frequent sight of dog waste on the sidewalks, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To get a sense of Portland, Oregon, you must first grasp the concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, painted on a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club (often pushing the boundaries of legality), is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s—a time when the city was less famous and costly, fostering vibrant and distinctive subcultures. For others, it serves as an invitation, a signal that in Portland, being called weird is a form of praise. Even with the arrival of wealthy Californians and the relentless construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always equate to being inclusive, but it does imply an openness to the unconventional. While Portland, like much of the country, depends heavily on goods from China and faces contemporary challenges, it boasts an array of ordinary elements. It has yoga sessions, hipsters, and corporate professionals. Perhaps the essence of weirdness here is a lighter approach to these norms. In my part of town, as in many others, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and during summer, free boxes. These boxes—often made of cardboard, but sometimes plastic—offer a serendipitous array of items someone no longer needs. More often than not, they hold a delightful surprise perfect for a passerby. Clothing and books are common finds, though almost anything might appear. This element of surprise walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the city's spirit. Or at least, it defines Portland for me. But I'm just one of the myriad of \"weird\" individuals here. Some locals would never consider picking their clothes from a street-side box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga sessions with live goats) or cheer for the Timbers, our soccer team. Portland is a melting pot of diverse passions and aspirations. Here, people chase their dreams, or perhaps fantasize about them while lingering too long at a bar. It's true that Portland faces challenges, such as drug issues often rooted in mental health struggles, exacerbated by the long, rainy, and cloudy seasons. Homelessness is another pressing issue, with no clear solution. The homeless are often drawn by Portland's relatively superior social services compared to other regions, though these services remain inadequate. The general populace oscillates between compassion and resentment. In this regard, we are quite typical.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast, always present. In the north, they observe each sunrise and sunset with unwavering patience. Even when I am so engrossed in the busyness of life that I neglect their presence, they remain unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress weighs heavily on me, they insist on being noticed, and in their presence, I find a calm for my restless mind and gain the strength to persevere, each day as it comes. When I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, it was the northern mountains that captured my attention. The university has its own allure with its impressive architecture, tranquil ponds, and lush trees, each holding a special place in my heart. Yet, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme in my affections. The town itself is charming, home to numerous cafés where countless hours were spent studying amidst the aroma of coffee. A short walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where old brick buildings create an atmosphere rich with history, giving this suburban town a lively energy comparable to its nearby urban counterpart. However, this bustling area quickly fades, allowing one to return to the peacefulness of small-town life by simply passing the library. This close-knit blend of contrasting environments offers the city an inviting charm, as if it’s inviting exploration. Here, one can easily form fond memories, each tied to different parts of the town. Whether it’s strolling past the aging swings in the park with friends after pulling an all-nighter or dashing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university, each experience is unique. Of course, like any place, it also holds its share of difficult memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as a place for both deep contemplation and tearful reflections during moments of existential crisis, something I am quite familiar with. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects going about their lives, each fulfilling some role, I often pondered my own purpose as I navigated the complexities of life. So, I would walk past the pond, through the park, and beyond the suburban homes until reaching a main street. It was then that the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees and painted the sky, and looking up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, unchanged as ever. The imposing mountains rose above the hazy blue and yellow sky, more prominent than any building on the horizon, and in their silent presence, they reignited my determination.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it. It's tucked away in a residential area behind a shopping center, not exactly where you'd expect people to live. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and head behind the hotels—mostly empty except for a few summer family reunions—you'll discover a lively community. This neighborhood, nestled on these streets, features several apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged in a row. The first set of apartments has garnered some media attention for unsavory issues, so we'll skip over those—appearances can often be misleading. Adjacent to those, and the next two complexes, lies a hidden world unknown to many locals. Opposite these complexes is a satellite campus of a community college, a tranquil collection of buildings where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning as early as 7 AM to start their day. The gates creak open, letting them in one at a time, while irritated drivers complain about the traffic delays on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. The center has cheerful porch seating and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Across the street, children play in the park, running across the grass while bees buzz around flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, scowling at skateboarders and nodding politely to teenage girls chatting by the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant in a strip mall offers affordable food yet remains uncrowded, next to a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor hibachi chicken all in one stop—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where park-goers often hold chilly cups topped with various treats, performing skateboard tricks and vaping as they see it as trendy. This neighborhood captures a slice of small-town America, a place in the unhurried South where time seems to stand still.",
            "The neighborhood I live in has its own unique charm. Most of the residences are standalone houses, but some have been cleverly divided into two attached units. My house features a modest yard at the front and a small driveway to the left. Like many others here, it harks back to an era when suburban living was synonymous with the American dream. Although this dream seems to be fading, my neighborhood and others like it continue to hold onto its essence, welcoming visitors with a reminder that the dream persists. People here may not feel as hopeful as before, and the gardens are not as meticulously maintained, yet driveways are still occupied by a car or two, and children continue to play as if their surroundings are their entire world. The public school, with its nearly 90-year history, stands as a beacon for the future generation, stirring nostalgia among older residents. While churches are sparsely scattered and often empty, the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has a distinct appearance, but they all share a common feel. There's a large supermarket named Super \"A,\" run by a Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the area. The majority of the population is African American. The streets are broad, allowing children to play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many families have lived here for generations, sharing stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but as interest in karate waned with the decline in related movies, it transformed into a pharmacy, a nod to the belief that medicine solves all, or so the saying goes. A small movie theater screens classic films at a lower price, shunned by the youth for its lack of new releases but cherished by older residents as an affordable night out without the kids. An expressway runs through our town, but the entry and exit ramps are in the neighboring town. A petition for an exit in our town was supported by the younger residents, while the elders opposed it, fearing it would disrupt our community, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the proposal. A new high school is underway, and we're in the process of selecting a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin, as it truly captures the spirit of our town.",
            "Living in a bustling metropolis means my neighborhood is a true melting pot of cultures and lifestyles. The residential zones are interspersed with commercial districts, featuring an array of businesses including offices, shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's no end to the new dining spots or shopping experiences, ranging from large, familiar retail chains to charming small boutiques. These smaller stores are increasingly drawing attention, not only in shopping centers but also along the streets, which are conveniently close to otherwise peaceful residential areas. Nearby parks offer a retreat where families often enjoy time with their children. My neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity, showcasing a vibrant mix of communities, such as a notable LGBTQ+ presence, an Orthodox Jewish enclave, and a group of former Soviet Union immigrants and refugees. Venturing slightly beyond, the cultural diversity blossoms further, with distinct areas like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia just a few miles away. However, navigating these distances can be time-consuming due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours, making a 10-mile journey last up to two hours. Despite the close proximity of various attractions, the city's vastness discourages walking as the main mode of transport, leading to notoriously congested roads and scarce parking. Ironically, the city is seeing a boom in construction, with new apartment complexes rising despite residents' concerns about increasing population density and traffic woes. Housing in the city is varied, with options ranging from large apartment complexes to smaller homes and condos. Some areas feature single-family houses, while others have duplexes, adding to the diversity of living arrangements. My immediate neighborhood reflects this variety, with people of different ages and backgrounds. Despite this, I am not well-acquainted with most of my neighbors, as the community isn't as close-knit as it once was. I fondly recall childhood days playing outdoors with my next-door neighbor and a few friends of similar age, but those interactions seem less common now.",
            "As we cruised by the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" anticipating her surprise at the vast emptiness surrounding us. Coming from a place where the grocery store was just a five-minute stroll away, she had never experienced such expansive open space. The sight of the endless cornfields was a revelation, and I shared with her what life was like growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she truly began to understand who I was and the environment that shaped me. Traveling down a narrow country road, we eventually reached a quarry brimming with water. Just beyond this landmark lies the modest neighborhood where I reside. The homes are primarily constructed of brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre, which residents take great pride in maintaining. Springtime brings an abundance of freshly planted flowers alongside the Midwestern trees that transform with the seasons. Driveways gleam with high-end Mercedes Benz cars, polished to shine beneath the midday sun after a thorough wash. As we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was outside, always with a welcoming smile. He often spends his days mowing his lawn, his voice harmonizing with the mower's hum. His presence brings joy to the neighborhood; despite aging and losing some sharpness, he remains genuine and intriguing. Previously a doctor, he now seamlessly blends with the grass on his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, we arrived at my home, where geese populate the side yard, playfully pursued by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, filling the air with the sounds of bullfrogs, flowing water, and the occasional cow's moo from distant farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched sanctuary of wild trees, herbs, and flowers. This is where I spent much of my youth, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them, always with a neighborhood friend nearby. Winters in our town can be harsh, yet they bring a unique beauty. The yard shifts from a green sea to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant blossoms now stand as stark skeletons. When snow graces us, a magical scene emerges overnight. The backyard becomes a canvas for snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. Our childhood quarrels were fought with snowballs, constructed in massive igloo-like forts built with branches, ready for battle. In our private winter world, we indulged in make-believe, a time when nothing else mattered. We were simply carefree kids, lost in our own adventures."
