            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America lies my home, a small town in Michigan where vast farmlands transition seamlessly into quaint tourist destinations. This area lacks the bustling energy of large city malls, as well as chain stores like Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s—every destination requires a drive. Yet, the location is nothing short of stunning, as it's enveloped by water. The town is flanked by the breathtaking Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering countless beaches for a leisurely stroll or a refreshing dip. My neighborhood epitomizes the essence of a small town. Here, homes aren't crammed together or mass-produced; they are unique, with some having been modernized while others retain their vintage charm. Most houses boast full, visible basements and display a variety of colors with their classic aluminum siding. Each property often features a yard, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes gardens or animal enclosures. This community reflects the spirit of Middle America—diligent individuals nurturing or having nurtured families. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, while residents walk their dogs, cycle, or rollerblade. There's a strong sense of familiarity among neighbors, easily identifying who belongs and who doesn't. It’s common to exchange waves with someone grilling outside or share a friendly smile with a dog walker from another block. Lawns are well-maintained, free of autumn leaves, with neatly trimmed grass, plants, and bushes. While it may not be the most picturesque neighborhood, it exudes warmth and is clearly a wonderful place to raise a family. It's a quiet, peaceful, and secure environment. Though modest in appearance, it embodies the universal desire for a safe haven at the day’s end. Nearby, within walking distance, are the county sheriff's office and jail, the health department, and the city recycling center, all serving the local community. Close by are baseball and softball fields, where the sounds of announcers can be heard echoing names and scores. The small town airport is adjacent, and the gentle hum of small planes taking off and landing is a familiar backdrop. A local ice cream shop offers a sweet treat within strolling distance, and for those who enjoy a walk, downtown is accessible from our neighborhood. My children can easily bike to a park that’s just about eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The place where I reside can be summed up as a classic example of suburban living. In my specific neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner’s association is quite noticeable. As you enter, you’re greeted by rows of neatly kept single-family homes, a testament to the homeowner’s association’s efforts. The front lawns bear a striking similarity: small patches of manicured grass, decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Occasionally, you might see a few small trees. Each home comes with a two-car garage. As you drive around, you’ll observe the freshly paved roads, which are impressively maintained despite the many families who live here. You won’t encounter any potholes or damage. Most of the homes are one-story, although there are occasional two-story ones. Unlike typical single-family homes, we don’t have individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there’s a cluster of mailboxes at the street’s end, similar to an apartment setup. Residents use a key to access their mailbox, and there are two bigger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another result of the HOA’s regulations. My house is situated on the outskirts of a nearby city, making our neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, we have ample space for various activities. There are several community pools, accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and enclosed. Additionally, there are walking trails for dog walks or solo evening strolls. You don’t need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is expansive enough to jog around for a good workout. The community predominantly consists of retired individuals, creating a safe and watchful environment. There are also a few middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it’s surprisingly populous but still retains a small-town vibe. It provides nearly all the essential amenities. For instance, there’s one mall—not enormous, but functional. For me, it takes about 15 minutes to drive to key locations, but once there, a variety of stores are available. Everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to discount outlets with limited selections and minimal staff for cost efficiency can be found. Overall, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and fairly standard. We enjoy amenities like pools and trails, and while we’re not immediately adjacent to shopping areas, a short drive connects us to major retail chains.",
            "The first I learned about my apartment was through a podcast discussing missing persons cases. It came as a bit of a surprise. Most apartments in the vicinity are priced well over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had heard anything about the story. Perhaps it's the hardship. Some of my friends find themselves in tears before falling asleep. Life is costly, but over the years, we've mastered the art of thriftiness. You start to appreciate the musty aroma of toys from flea markets and clothes with mothball scents. As adults, we seem to smell less. You might take up smoking, or maybe you just grow used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market remains a constant. The scent of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It embeds itself in leather and lingers even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you begin at the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, yet you'd never hear it inside the thrifts. Regardless of the number of people or cars passing by, the stores remain quiet. They're perfect for losing an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood in. It's a city in development, they say. Although it hosts the headquarters of a major online commerce and delivery giant, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, and not much is expected from you. You can be solitary, silent, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's unlike the South, where showing concern signifies care. Here, people don't intrude into your life. You can maintain your privacy as long as you wish, and the city will ebb and flow like waves on a shore. It's a vibrant place to be. With a pianist living next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, our apartment isn't just a collection of strangers but a community of friends. We gather for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make an effort to keep my space tidy and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail for one another. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I reside in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, but people like my neighbors make me feel that I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a modest Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban reach of a sizable city. My neighborhood, positioned on the eastern side of town, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property prices here are quite low, with most homes being either rented or owned by individuals with limited incomes. Nonetheless, the area is far from unattractive or unpleasant. The people living nearby are generally amicable and often exchange smiles and greetings as I stroll down the street. Although crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of the town, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, a few violent incidents have occurred within a few blocks from my house, including several shootings and at least one fatality. Tragically, our next-door neighbors lost their son to a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family hasn't been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item disappearing from our porch when we forget to bring it in. The town itself has been deeply touched by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has swept across many regions of the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are several resources available in town to tackle this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for those supporting individuals with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts many positive qualities. My son's elementary school has an outstanding team, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Even with his special needs, he has not experienced any bullying, thanks to the school's incredibly positive environment, and he absolutely loves attending. We have a proactive PTO that organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational advancement. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family or child is regarded as \"less than\" due to financial constraints, and the costs associated with school fees, supplies, and field trips are quite reasonable. The City Council and staff have undertaken several beautification projects in town, including road resurfacing, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Regrettably, most of these improvements have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are located and most traffic flows. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, which is a sore point among my neighbors. On the whole, I enjoy residing in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options (ranging from small businesses to larger retail outlets) to satisfy my family's needs, and while our home might not be of high value, it is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot envision calling any other place home.",
            "My neighborhood is teeming with diverse cultural influences. Perched atop a hill, it's surrounded by buildings that hold historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite the old live theater, and just a block down the hill lies a fascinating arcade bar that attracts a variety of people during warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people eagerly waiting to enter. A few blocks in the opposite direction is the nearest city park, surprisingly large given its urban location. Surrounding the park is a concrete border with tall steps built into it. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals line the sidewalks and wide steps with their tents in neat rows. Though snow is rare, the heavy rain that falls mid-winter makes it challenging to stay warm. By setting their tents close together in the heart of the city rather than in more isolated areas, they manage to keep warmer and remain within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing facilities.\n\nWhat truly endears my city to me is not just its historical charm—the towering buildings and the architecture spread across the hills leading to the ocean—but the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, still carries stories from those times, even three decades later, when federal officials and the DEA attempted to clean up the streets. These stories persist through generations and reach newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the community works hard to maintain its cleanliness and stay informed about local happenings. There's an old saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this caution harks back to earlier times and carries the weight of social conditioning. Perhaps my ambiguous appearance helps me blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the persistent issues of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions rooted in ignorance and fear, even in a city celebrated as a cultural melting pot. No matter how far I travel, Hilltop remains my home. Walking those streets at night invigorates me, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners graciously keep their doors open a bit longer so I can charge my phone when there's no other refuge from the rain. It's a place where, even on the dreariest of nights, someone will stop, look me in the eye, hand me a five-dollar bill, and remind me that I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this area just as I was beginning eighth grade. Initially, forming friendships was a challenge, but eventually, I became close with a neighbor two doors down and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain vivid. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On warm weekends, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, the area is quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the residents; everyone respects your space unless assistance is needed. I've ordered numerous items online, and none have ever been taken from my porch, which makes me feel secure with my neighbors. A park is just a short walk away, where I've accumulated many memories. I've played various sports there, and despite a bad experience of getting an elbow to the nose while playing football, the positive memories outweigh the negative. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's young children, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park now evokes a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a mile, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian options. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food outlets are the most popular, as expected in most suburbs, along with numerous pizza places. The local stores provide all necessities, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco, a well-known Midwest grocery chain, all nearby. There's even an Indian-owned store for anyone interested in cooking or buying Indian food. I genuinely appreciate my neighborhood, especially after hearing about the difficulties others face with their neighbors on social media and the news. It makes me truly grateful for my own experience here.",
            "The neighborhood where I reside is conveniently close to the college I attend, which adds to the enjoyment of living here. The area is predominantly filled with apartment buildings, along with some restaurants and bars that offer a good time without being too pricey. One of the bars recently underwent a name change; though it’s pricier, the quality of service and drinks isn't disappointing. The community generally consists of friendly individuals, mostly college students or those with lower incomes, as the apartments are affordably priced. An elementary school nearby brings many children to the vicinity. While I haven't formed relationships with my neighbors, I'm not particularly inclined to, as they frequently smoke cannabis. This led the building management to install an air freshener unit opposite their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing yet somewhat offensive. Although the buildings around me often appear aged, they might have updated interiors. Further down the street are newer apartments that I dislike due to their poor construction despite high rents, which seem exploitative given their proximity to campus. About five minutes away is an inexpensive eatery that serves meals on paper plates, primarily using microwaved food. Across from it lies a gas station reputed to be an undesirable workplace. However, a city grant allowed for road improvements last summer, resulting in a wide sidewalk and landscaped medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment is surrounded by trees, though some were recently cut, leaving stumps, but there are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my apartment is a tree line, followed by another apartment complex. I reside on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, just behind, is less appealing with deteriorating sidewalks and rundown buildings, which the trees might be intended to conceal. Crime is mostly associated with an apartment complex on that street, although there's also considerable crime and a transient community across from me. Despite these issues, I find my living situation satisfactory due to its affordability and the abundance of nearby amenities. I particularly appreciate the university's walking distance and the two bus stops that facilitate easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, you'll find duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they resemble standalone homes. Each one sports a yellow hue, complemented by white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly with one another, often gathering in the evenings at the end of random driveways to chat while kids play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or kites. This simple camaraderie is a refreshing escape from our technology-driven lives, almost like a glimpse into the past. Surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds overhead, it’s quite picturesque. However, this season brought tornado warnings, and last night, for the first time, the sirens went off, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows. My larger dog, uneasy with the situation, stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, aside from the sound of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the rapid temperature drop, from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, causing the hail to melt instantly on the warm pavement. As the skies started to clear, the sun peeked through, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped photos to share on Facebook, where friends and family marveled alongside me. The streets stayed silent for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm passed. Then, life resumed its usual pace, with moms and kids outside while dinner was prepared. This welcoming neighborhood is a delight for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love hearing the southern accent. My apartment, like all others here, has two bedrooms and two baths, though the interiors vary. Some are surprisingly small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the expansive field behind my place and heading to the pond, even though it's not for swimming. Deer sightings are common, and in the morning, the sound of a bullfrog fills the air. Living just forty minutes from Charlotte, it’s a fantastic place to call home. Roosters crow each morning from nearby farms, adding to the village-like atmosphere. We even have a donkey nearby who brays in the evening, reminding us of his presence. Finding this charming neighborhood was a stroke of luck.",
            "Having called this place home for about a decade, I feel I can share some insights. Initially, moving to my current neighborhood was difficult. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge was emotional, and I shed tears missing my old friends and surroundings. However, my parents made the decision with my sister and me in mind, seeking better housing and education opportunities. Our new area had a reputation for being more upscale compared to our previous home. Over time, I adjusted to the change, making both friends and a few rivals at school. My relationship with neighbors remained limited, except for the bond we formed with Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family, and I cherish our connection. A memorable event was attending Mr. Glen’s wedding when he remarried. It was a joyous occasion, filled with laughter and dancing, giving me a glimpse of what I hope to achieve in my own future—a successful life and a happy marriage. I even caught the garter, although not the bouquet! That night was particularly special as I danced with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, whom I haven't seen since. I wish her well in her journey. \n\nThe layout of our neighborhood is complex, but with GPS, I explore more freely now. My adventures have mostly been with friends like Kason and Curtis, with whom I spent countless hours playing video games and savoring life. Occasionally, I find solace in our local park, enjoying nature’s calming influence. There, I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and engage in some light swordplay with my bokken. These activities bring me joy. Our community also offers basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a while. It’s reassuring to know they’re available if I decide to return to the sport. My father introduced my best friend and me to tennis, and with Mr. Graves' coaching, we had our share of rigorous yet fun sessions. Reflecting on my time here, I realize there have been numerous memorable moments, but these stand out the most. I’m optimistic about what the future holds.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming little town that might not catch your eye at first glance but plays a pivotal role in the agricultural scene. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, a claim boldly displayed on its welcoming sign. This town is predominantly covered in farmland, with either peach orchards or cattle pastures dominating the landscape. Houses outside the central area are generously spaced, often two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to fend off the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Typically, these homes are set back from the main roads, with front fields dedicated to livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, a solitary traffic light presides over a four-way intersection, surrounded by the town’s only stores. For quick bites, there’s Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger joint. A pizzeria once existed here but has since closed its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is well-loved for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's lone, albeit pricey, grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Many residents prefer to drive to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for the bulk of their groceries, stopping at IGA for just a few items. Dollar General is the town's busiest spot, offering a wide range of everyday goods and bustling from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store run by a community-favorite lady, has been around for years and even offers delivery by two movers. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both the doctor's office and veterinary clinic are located away from the town's core, yet they are well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only elementary institution, with middle and high school students commuting to the next town. Though technically devoid of parks, plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family outings and attract visitors or new residents. While entertainment options are limited—no theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or diverse dining—the town’s simplicity is its charm, so much so that you could easily pass through without noticing!",
            "Residing in a typical suburban setting within a quaint town in Tennessee, my home is situated on a road that connects two state highways. This results in more traffic than preferred, yet the neighborhood remains mostly peaceful. The community is stable, with few residents moving in or out, allowing us to become well-acquainted with our neighbors. Many people spend their time tending to their yards and taking care of daily tasks. In the colder months, sledding down the hill on our adjacent street becomes a fun activity. Our house is located at the street's front corner, giving us a clear view of the daily comings and goings, and we recognize most of the vehicles. Unfamiliar cars catch our attention. Neighbors often walk, either for exercise or while walking their dogs, and children can be seen riding bikes, typical of suburban life. As we work from home, my wife and I, along with our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, spend a significant amount of time at home. Consequently, the neighbors have grown accustomed to our presence as well. We often enjoy playing outside, even if it's raining. Occasionally, we grill on our back deck, with the barbecue's aroma filling the air pleasantly. From March to October, lawnmowers are a common sound, as residents regularly maintain their yards. Originally a forested region, our area boasts abundant trees, providing shade but also a significant leaf cleanup during fall. The smell of burning leaves, which I find pleasant, signals the arrival of autumn. Recent winters have been mild, making the season feel like an extended fall. Our garage, located at the back of the house, means the front door is infrequently used unless someone rings the bell, an uncommon occurrence. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a serene atmosphere, though Thanksgiving and other occasions like Mother's Day and Christmas see an influx of visiting families, resulting in additional parked cars. Overall, I am fond of living here, and it would be ideal if it weren't a through street.",
            "Nestled in the heart of the high desert, my neighborhood is surrounded by endless stretches of arid land. The landscape is dominated by shades of brown, and unless you’ve lived here, it’s hard to grasp the monotony of this view. Spotting a green lawn is rare, and when you do, it’s clear that maintaining it requires considerable investment. In the 90s, when I first moved here, homes were widely spaced. That hasn’t changed much, although there are more new developments now. The area is gradually taking on a more urban feel, a trend seen in many places. The community is generally welcoming, though, like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood is surrounded by amiable elderly folks, which makes it quite pleasant. The local stores are mostly chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you'll have to venture farther away, as options like Whole Foods are scarce. Construction appears to be the dominant industry here, possibly because there's still plenty of undeveloped land. This prospect is somewhat unsettling for me, as I prefer the current state of things, having left a bustling city behind. My career is in construction as a drywall and T-bar installer. One aspect I appreciate about living here is the wildlife. Many are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty. The unique climate and terrain create challenging ecosystems that are home to diverse wildlife, which requires protection. Residents should take time to understand and coexist with these non-human neighbors. My family has embraced the local fauna; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects and are often outside trying to catch them. As for attractions, there are a few. Victorville offers families a chance to explore the desert environment, providing a unique experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a delightful mix of activities and entertainment. Nearby Wrightwood offers snowy mountain views and winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the evolution of Victorville’s society and industry.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response might stand out as a bit different. While many who answer this question are likely homeowners with their own distinct lives, my circumstances are slightly unconventional. I think of my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the people in my dormitory as my immediate community. I also consider the broader campus area as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with the traditional conceptions of a neighborhood. Just like any regular neighborhood, mine has residences, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by looking at the “houses” that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it’s important to outline the types of housing available in my area. There are three main housing types close by: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory buildings. First, in the apartments, typically 2-4 individuals occupy each room, with about 4-6 rooms on a floor. Most buildings feature about 2 floors, so roughly 20 people reside in each building. Next, there are the actual houses, which are accessible for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. These are generally 2-4 bedroom configurations, often occupied by alumni. However, these types of houses are less numerous, as they are not as space-efficient. Lastly, there are the typical dorm rooms that accommodate hundreds of students. In these, two people usually share a room, with some exceptions, making it the most prevalent form of housing in my neighborhood. With housing addressed, let’s move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity, and this is evident in my neighborhood’s demographics. There are individuals from various cultures and age groups living here. Most of the professional staff reside in the neighborhood’s houses, while newer students occupy dormitory-style housing and older students tend to live in apartment-style housing. It’s hard to capture the essence of the people in my neighborhood with just words, so it’s best to proceed to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as its own self-contained neighborhood, it boasts numerous stores and a single park. The stores consist of dining options you’d find in any other neighborhood, along with the school’s unique clothing and grocery outlets. As such, anything needed is readily available within the neighborhood’s limits! Furthermore, the park serves as a recreational area for the diverse community, maintained clean and safe by all neighborhood members!",
            "In my area, sidewalks are a rarity. The landscape slopes downward significantly, with my home perched atop the steepest hill in the vicinity. It's often dubbed the \"workout hill\" by locals due to the numerous joggers who tackle it as part of their exercise routine. With no sidewalks along my street, pedestrians share the road with vehicles. The road itself is riddled with potholes, making driving a bit dicey. Telephone and electrical wires crisscross above, giving off a frayed appearance. Frequent rainstorms lead to fallen branches that knock out power lines, resulting in a patchwork of repairs. Towering evergreen trees abound, though they're not universally loved. Many residents cut them down to clear the ocean view. That's why numerous homes are constructed high on the hill, featuring expansive glass facades to capture the bay's vista. The sunset casts a beautiful glow on the water, turning the sky a vibrant orange. However, cloudy skies prevail, often reducing sunlight to a mere haze. Overcast, damp days are the norm, encouraging moss to thrive on all surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, requiring a laborious three-hour cleaning session. Children are scarce in my neighborhood despite a school nearby; most residents are older and retired. Dogs are more common than kids, often lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leaving a door or window open might invite an unexpected canine visitor indoors—I once had to gently escort one out of my living room. Wild rabbits roam freely, much to the dismay of gardeners who find their lawns uprooted. My cats, however, enjoy hunting them, keeping their numbers in check. Our avian visitors include sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, until they're driven away by the resident crows. While there are no shops in the neighborhood, a trek downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The shore lacks a sandy beach, but the rocky edge invites stone-skipping. The bay isn't expansive; even through the mist, you can often see the far shore.",
            "If you intend to explore Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, rest assured that reaching it is quite straightforward! Public transit is highly accessible and remains a favored mode of travel in New York City. Bensonhurst retains an urban character, making you feel very much in the heart of New York City. As you wander through the area, expect to see a multitude of Asian shops dotting the landscape. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant increase in Asian residents in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll notice an Asian-owned establishment on nearly every block you traverse, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are quite popular among the locals due to their excellent food quality, lower prices, and notable convenience. For instance, there are four Asian supermarkets located within a two-minute walk from one another near my location, enhancing the ease of grocery shopping. While Bensonhurst has a strong Asian presence, it is, in fact, a diverse community with a mix of immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children. Many of the most significant and well-known businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there is a newly refurbished park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a spacious field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, playgrounds for children, swings, and even a water fountain for summertime fun. True to New York City, the parks here showcase remarkable diversity, providing a space where everyone can play and interact harmoniously. The neighborhood doesn't host many large corporate structures; instead, you will find co-op living buildings or condominium apartments, with two-family homes being the predominant type of residence. The community is generally friendly, albeit a bit loud. It's common to hear cars with booming music or engines revving as they pass by, which might serve as an unwelcome alarm clock. If you decide to visit at night, it's wise to stay alert. The area is relatively safe, but unpredictability can occur, with the potential for encounters with troublesome individuals. Personally, I've experienced bullying in this neighborhood in the past, including physical confrontations, though this was years ago. Recently, package theft has been an issue too. Despite regulations in New York City about cleaning up after dogs, compliance is lacking here. Each morning, you'll likely come across dog waste on your route to the train or the supermarket. My main annoyance is the frequent sight of dog waste on the sidewalks, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To get a sense of Portland, Oregon, you must first grasp the concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, painted on a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club (often pushing the boundaries of legality), is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s—a time when the city was less famous and costly, fostering vibrant and distinctive subcultures. For others, it serves as an invitation, a signal that in Portland, being called weird is a form of praise. Even with the arrival of wealthy Californians and the relentless construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always equate to being inclusive, but it does imply an openness to the unconventional. While Portland, like much of the country, depends heavily on goods from China and faces contemporary challenges, it boasts an array of ordinary elements. It has yoga sessions, hipsters, and corporate professionals. Perhaps the essence of weirdness here is a lighter approach to these norms. In my part of town, as in many others, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and during summer, free boxes. These boxes—often made of cardboard, but sometimes plastic—offer a serendipitous array of items someone no longer needs. More often than not, they hold a delightful surprise perfect for a passerby. Clothing and books are common finds, though almost anything might appear. This element of surprise walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the city's spirit. Or at least, it defines Portland for me. But I'm just one of the myriad of \"weird\" individuals here. Some locals would never consider picking their clothes from a street-side box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga sessions with live goats) or cheer for the Timbers, our soccer team. Portland is a melting pot of diverse passions and aspirations. Here, people chase their dreams, or perhaps fantasize about them while lingering too long at a bar. It's true that Portland faces challenges, such as drug issues often rooted in mental health struggles, exacerbated by the long, rainy, and cloudy seasons. Homelessness is another pressing issue, with no clear solution. The homeless are often drawn by Portland's relatively superior social services compared to other regions, though these services remain inadequate. The general populace oscillates between compassion and resentment. In this regard, we are quite typical.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast, always present. In the north, they observe each sunrise and sunset with unwavering patience. Even when I am so engrossed in the busyness of life that I neglect their presence, they remain unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress weighs heavily on me, they insist on being noticed, and in their presence, I find a calm for my restless mind and gain the strength to persevere, each day as it comes. When I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, it was the northern mountains that captured my attention. The university has its own allure with its impressive architecture, tranquil ponds, and lush trees, each holding a special place in my heart. Yet, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme in my affections. The town itself is charming, home to numerous cafés where countless hours were spent studying amidst the aroma of coffee. A short walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where old brick buildings create an atmosphere rich with history, giving this suburban town a lively energy comparable to its nearby urban counterpart. However, this bustling area quickly fades, allowing one to return to the peacefulness of small-town life by simply passing the library. This close-knit blend of contrasting environments offers the city an inviting charm, as if it’s inviting exploration. Here, one can easily form fond memories, each tied to different parts of the town. Whether it’s strolling past the aging swings in the park with friends after pulling an all-nighter or dashing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university, each experience is unique. Of course, like any place, it also holds its share of difficult memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as a place for both deep contemplation and tearful reflections during moments of existential crisis, something I am quite familiar with. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects going about their lives, each fulfilling some role, I often pondered my own purpose as I navigated the complexities of life. So, I would walk past the pond, through the park, and beyond the suburban homes until reaching a main street. It was then that the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees and painted the sky, and looking up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, unchanged as ever. The imposing mountains rose above the hazy blue and yellow sky, more prominent than any building on the horizon, and in their silent presence, they reignited my determination.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it. It's tucked away in a residential area behind a shopping center, not exactly where you'd expect people to live. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and head behind the hotels—mostly empty except for a few summer family reunions—you'll discover a lively community. This neighborhood, nestled on these streets, features several apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged in a row. The first set of apartments has garnered some media attention for unsavory issues, so we'll skip over those—appearances can often be misleading. Adjacent to those, and the next two complexes, lies a hidden world unknown to many locals. Opposite these complexes is a satellite campus of a community college, a tranquil collection of buildings where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning as early as 7 AM to start their day. The gates creak open, letting them in one at a time, while irritated drivers complain about the traffic delays on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. The center has cheerful porch seating and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Across the street, children play in the park, running across the grass while bees buzz around flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, scowling at skateboarders and nodding politely to teenage girls chatting by the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant in a strip mall offers affordable food yet remains uncrowded, next to a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor hibachi chicken all in one stop—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where park-goers often hold chilly cups topped with various treats, performing skateboard tricks and vaping as they see it as trendy. This neighborhood captures a slice of small-town America, a place in the unhurried South where time seems to stand still.",
            "The neighborhood I live in has its own unique charm. Most of the residences are standalone houses, but some have been cleverly divided into two attached units. My house features a modest yard at the front and a small driveway to the left. Like many others here, it harks back to an era when suburban living was synonymous with the American dream. Although this dream seems to be fading, my neighborhood and others like it continue to hold onto its essence, welcoming visitors with a reminder that the dream persists. People here may not feel as hopeful as before, and the gardens are not as meticulously maintained, yet driveways are still occupied by a car or two, and children continue to play as if their surroundings are their entire world. The public school, with its nearly 90-year history, stands as a beacon for the future generation, stirring nostalgia among older residents. While churches are sparsely scattered and often empty, the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has a distinct appearance, but they all share a common feel. There's a large supermarket named Super \"A,\" run by a Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the area. The majority of the population is African American. The streets are broad, allowing children to play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many families have lived here for generations, sharing stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but as interest in karate waned with the decline in related movies, it transformed into a pharmacy, a nod to the belief that medicine solves all, or so the saying goes. A small movie theater screens classic films at a lower price, shunned by the youth for its lack of new releases but cherished by older residents as an affordable night out without the kids. An expressway runs through our town, but the entry and exit ramps are in the neighboring town. A petition for an exit in our town was supported by the younger residents, while the elders opposed it, fearing it would disrupt our community, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the proposal. A new high school is underway, and we're in the process of selecting a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin, as it truly captures the spirit of our town.",
            "Living in a bustling metropolis means my neighborhood is a true melting pot of cultures and lifestyles. The residential zones are interspersed with commercial districts, featuring an array of businesses including offices, shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's no end to the new dining spots or shopping experiences, ranging from large, familiar retail chains to charming small boutiques. These smaller stores are increasingly drawing attention, not only in shopping centers but also along the streets, which are conveniently close to otherwise peaceful residential areas. Nearby parks offer a retreat where families often enjoy time with their children. My neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity, showcasing a vibrant mix of communities, such as a notable LGBTQ+ presence, an Orthodox Jewish enclave, and a group of former Soviet Union immigrants and refugees. Venturing slightly beyond, the cultural diversity blossoms further, with distinct areas like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia just a few miles away. However, navigating these distances can be time-consuming due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours, making a 10-mile journey last up to two hours. Despite the close proximity of various attractions, the city's vastness discourages walking as the main mode of transport, leading to notoriously congested roads and scarce parking. Ironically, the city is seeing a boom in construction, with new apartment complexes rising despite residents' concerns about increasing population density and traffic woes. Housing in the city is varied, with options ranging from large apartment complexes to smaller homes and condos. Some areas feature single-family houses, while others have duplexes, adding to the diversity of living arrangements. My immediate neighborhood reflects this variety, with people of different ages and backgrounds. Despite this, I am not well-acquainted with most of my neighbors, as the community isn't as close-knit as it once was. I fondly recall childhood days playing outdoors with my next-door neighbor and a few friends of similar age, but those interactions seem less common now.",
            "As we cruised by the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" anticipating her surprise at the vast emptiness surrounding us. Coming from a place where the grocery store was just a five-minute stroll away, she had never experienced such expansive open space. The sight of the endless cornfields was a revelation, and I shared with her what life was like growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she truly began to understand who I was and the environment that shaped me. Traveling down a narrow country road, we eventually reached a quarry brimming with water. Just beyond this landmark lies the modest neighborhood where I reside. The homes are primarily constructed of brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre, which residents take great pride in maintaining. Springtime brings an abundance of freshly planted flowers alongside the Midwestern trees that transform with the seasons. Driveways gleam with high-end Mercedes Benz cars, polished to shine beneath the midday sun after a thorough wash. As we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was outside, always with a welcoming smile. He often spends his days mowing his lawn, his voice harmonizing with the mower's hum. His presence brings joy to the neighborhood; despite aging and losing some sharpness, he remains genuine and intriguing. Previously a doctor, he now seamlessly blends with the grass on his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, we arrived at my home, where geese populate the side yard, playfully pursued by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, filling the air with the sounds of bullfrogs, flowing water, and the occasional cow's moo from distant farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched sanctuary of wild trees, herbs, and flowers. This is where I spent much of my youth, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them, always with a neighborhood friend nearby. Winters in our town can be harsh, yet they bring a unique beauty. The yard shifts from a green sea to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant blossoms now stand as stark skeletons. When snow graces us, a magical scene emerges overnight. The backyard becomes a canvas for snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. Our childhood quarrels were fought with snowballs, constructed in massive igloo-like forts built with branches, ready for battle. In our private winter world, we indulged in make-believe, a time when nothing else mattered. We were simply carefree kids, lost in our own adventures."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America lies my home, a small town in Michigan where vast farmlands transition seamlessly into quaint tourist destinations. This area lacks the bustling energy of large city malls, as well as chain stores like Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s—every destination requires a drive. Yet, the location is nothing short of stunning, as it's enveloped by water. The town is flanked by the breathtaking Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering countless beaches for a leisurely stroll or a refreshing dip. My neighborhood epitomizes the essence of a small town. Here, homes aren't crammed together or mass-produced; they are unique, with some having been modernized while others retain their vintage charm. Most houses boast full, visible basements and display a variety of colors with their classic aluminum siding. Each property often features a yard, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes gardens or animal enclosures. This community reflects the spirit of Middle America—diligent individuals nurturing or having nurtured families. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, while residents walk their dogs, cycle, or rollerblade. There's a strong sense of familiarity among neighbors, easily identifying who belongs and who doesn't. It’s common to exchange waves with someone grilling outside or share a friendly smile with a dog walker from another block. Lawns are well-maintained, free of autumn leaves, with neatly trimmed grass, plants, and bushes. While it may not be the most picturesque neighborhood, it exudes warmth and is clearly a wonderful place to raise a family. It's a quiet, peaceful, and secure environment. Though modest in appearance, it embodies the universal desire for a safe haven at the day’s end. Nearby, within walking distance, are the county sheriff's office and jail, the health department, and the city recycling center, all serving the local community. Close by are baseball and softball fields, where the sounds of announcers can be heard echoing names and scores. The small town airport is adjacent, and the gentle hum of small planes taking off and landing is a familiar backdrop. A local ice cream shop offers a sweet treat within strolling distance, and for those who enjoy a walk, downtown is accessible from our neighborhood. My children can easily bike to a park that’s just about eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The place where I reside can be summed up as a classic example of suburban living. In my specific neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner’s association is quite noticeable. As you enter, you’re greeted by rows of neatly kept single-family homes, a testament to the homeowner’s association’s efforts. The front lawns bear a striking similarity: small patches of manicured grass, decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Occasionally, you might see a few small trees. Each home comes with a two-car garage. As you drive around, you’ll observe the freshly paved roads, which are impressively maintained despite the many families who live here. You won’t encounter any potholes or damage. Most of the homes are one-story, although there are occasional two-story ones. Unlike typical single-family homes, we don’t have individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there’s a cluster of mailboxes at the street’s end, similar to an apartment setup. Residents use a key to access their mailbox, and there are two bigger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another result of the HOA’s regulations. My house is situated on the outskirts of a nearby city, making our neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, we have ample space for various activities. There are several community pools, accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and enclosed. Additionally, there are walking trails for dog walks or solo evening strolls. You don’t need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is expansive enough to jog around for a good workout. The community predominantly consists of retired individuals, creating a safe and watchful environment. There are also a few middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it’s surprisingly populous but still retains a small-town vibe. It provides nearly all the essential amenities. For instance, there’s one mall—not enormous, but functional. For me, it takes about 15 minutes to drive to key locations, but once there, a variety of stores are available. Everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to discount outlets with limited selections and minimal staff for cost efficiency can be found. Overall, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and fairly standard. We enjoy amenities like pools and trails, and while we’re not immediately adjacent to shopping areas, a short drive connects us to major retail chains.",
            "The first I learned about my apartment was through a podcast discussing missing persons cases. It came as a bit of a surprise. Most apartments in the vicinity are priced well over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had heard anything about the story. Perhaps it's the hardship. Some of my friends find themselves in tears before falling asleep. Life is costly, but over the years, we've mastered the art of thriftiness. You start to appreciate the musty aroma of toys from flea markets and clothes with mothball scents. As adults, we seem to smell less. You might take up smoking, or maybe you just grow used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market remains a constant. The scent of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It embeds itself in leather and lingers even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you begin at the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, yet you'd never hear it inside the thrifts. Regardless of the number of people or cars passing by, the stores remain quiet. They're perfect for losing an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood in. It's a city in development, they say. Although it hosts the headquarters of a major online commerce and delivery giant, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, and not much is expected from you. You can be solitary, silent, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's unlike the South, where showing concern signifies care. Here, people don't intrude into your life. You can maintain your privacy as long as you wish, and the city will ebb and flow like waves on a shore. It's a vibrant place to be. With a pianist living next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, our apartment isn't just a collection of strangers but a community of friends. We gather for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make an effort to keep my space tidy and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail for one another. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I reside in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, but people like my neighbors make me feel that I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a modest Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban reach of a sizable city. My neighborhood, positioned on the eastern side of town, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property prices here are quite low, with most homes being either rented or owned by individuals with limited incomes. Nonetheless, the area is far from unattractive or unpleasant. The people living nearby are generally amicable and often exchange smiles and greetings as I stroll down the street. Although crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of the town, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, a few violent incidents have occurred within a few blocks from my house, including several shootings and at least one fatality. Tragically, our next-door neighbors lost their son to a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family hasn't been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item disappearing from our porch when we forget to bring it in. The town itself has been deeply touched by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has swept across many regions of the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are several resources available in town to tackle this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for those supporting individuals with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts many positive qualities. My son's elementary school has an outstanding team, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Even with his special needs, he has not experienced any bullying, thanks to the school's incredibly positive environment, and he absolutely loves attending. We have a proactive PTO that organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational advancement. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family or child is regarded as \"less than\" due to financial constraints, and the costs associated with school fees, supplies, and field trips are quite reasonable. The City Council and staff have undertaken several beautification projects in town, including road resurfacing, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Regrettably, most of these improvements have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are located and most traffic flows. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, which is a sore point among my neighbors. On the whole, I enjoy residing in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options (ranging from small businesses to larger retail outlets) to satisfy my family's needs, and while our home might not be of high value, it is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot envision calling any other place home.",
            "My neighborhood is teeming with diverse cultural influences. Perched atop a hill, it's surrounded by buildings that hold historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite the old live theater, and just a block down the hill lies a fascinating arcade bar that attracts a variety of people during warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people eagerly waiting to enter. A few blocks in the opposite direction is the nearest city park, surprisingly large given its urban location. Surrounding the park is a concrete border with tall steps built into it. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals line the sidewalks and wide steps with their tents in neat rows. Though snow is rare, the heavy rain that falls mid-winter makes it challenging to stay warm. By setting their tents close together in the heart of the city rather than in more isolated areas, they manage to keep warmer and remain within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing facilities.\n\nWhat truly endears my city to me is not just its historical charm—the towering buildings and the architecture spread across the hills leading to the ocean—but the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, still carries stories from those times, even three decades later, when federal officials and the DEA attempted to clean up the streets. These stories persist through generations and reach newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the community works hard to maintain its cleanliness and stay informed about local happenings. There's an old saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this caution harks back to earlier times and carries the weight of social conditioning. Perhaps my ambiguous appearance helps me blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the persistent issues of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions rooted in ignorance and fear, even in a city celebrated as a cultural melting pot. No matter how far I travel, Hilltop remains my home. Walking those streets at night invigorates me, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners graciously keep their doors open a bit longer so I can charge my phone when there's no other refuge from the rain. It's a place where, even on the dreariest of nights, someone will stop, look me in the eye, hand me a five-dollar bill, and remind me that I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this area just as I was beginning eighth grade. Initially, forming friendships was a challenge, but eventually, I became close with a neighbor two doors down and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain vivid. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On warm weekends, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, the area is quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the residents; everyone respects your space unless assistance is needed. I've ordered numerous items online, and none have ever been taken from my porch, which makes me feel secure with my neighbors. A park is just a short walk away, where I've accumulated many memories. I've played various sports there, and despite a bad experience of getting an elbow to the nose while playing football, the positive memories outweigh the negative. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's young children, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park now evokes a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a mile, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian options. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food outlets are the most popular, as expected in most suburbs, along with numerous pizza places. The local stores provide all necessities, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco, a well-known Midwest grocery chain, all nearby. There's even an Indian-owned store for anyone interested in cooking or buying Indian food. I genuinely appreciate my neighborhood, especially after hearing about the difficulties others face with their neighbors on social media and the news. It makes me truly grateful for my own experience here.",
            "The neighborhood where I reside is conveniently close to the college I attend, which adds to the enjoyment of living here. The area is predominantly filled with apartment buildings, along with some restaurants and bars that offer a good time without being too pricey. One of the bars recently underwent a name change; though it’s pricier, the quality of service and drinks isn't disappointing. The community generally consists of friendly individuals, mostly college students or those with lower incomes, as the apartments are affordably priced. An elementary school nearby brings many children to the vicinity. While I haven't formed relationships with my neighbors, I'm not particularly inclined to, as they frequently smoke cannabis. This led the building management to install an air freshener unit opposite their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing yet somewhat offensive. Although the buildings around me often appear aged, they might have updated interiors. Further down the street are newer apartments that I dislike due to their poor construction despite high rents, which seem exploitative given their proximity to campus. About five minutes away is an inexpensive eatery that serves meals on paper plates, primarily using microwaved food. Across from it lies a gas station reputed to be an undesirable workplace. However, a city grant allowed for road improvements last summer, resulting in a wide sidewalk and landscaped medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment is surrounded by trees, though some were recently cut, leaving stumps, but there are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my apartment is a tree line, followed by another apartment complex. I reside on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, just behind, is less appealing with deteriorating sidewalks and rundown buildings, which the trees might be intended to conceal. Crime is mostly associated with an apartment complex on that street, although there's also considerable crime and a transient community across from me. Despite these issues, I find my living situation satisfactory due to its affordability and the abundance of nearby amenities. I particularly appreciate the university's walking distance and the two bus stops that facilitate easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, you'll find duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they resemble standalone homes. Each one sports a yellow hue, complemented by white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly with one another, often gathering in the evenings at the end of random driveways to chat while kids play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or kites. This simple camaraderie is a refreshing escape from our technology-driven lives, almost like a glimpse into the past. Surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds overhead, it’s quite picturesque. However, this season brought tornado warnings, and last night, for the first time, the sirens went off, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows. My larger dog, uneasy with the situation, stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, aside from the sound of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the rapid temperature drop, from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, causing the hail to melt instantly on the warm pavement. As the skies started to clear, the sun peeked through, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped photos to share on Facebook, where friends and family marveled alongside me. The streets stayed silent for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm passed. Then, life resumed its usual pace, with moms and kids outside while dinner was prepared. This welcoming neighborhood is a delight for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love hearing the southern accent. My apartment, like all others here, has two bedrooms and two baths, though the interiors vary. Some are surprisingly small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the expansive field behind my place and heading to the pond, even though it's not for swimming. Deer sightings are common, and in the morning, the sound of a bullfrog fills the air. Living just forty minutes from Charlotte, it’s a fantastic place to call home. Roosters crow each morning from nearby farms, adding to the village-like atmosphere. We even have a donkey nearby who brays in the evening, reminding us of his presence. Finding this charming neighborhood was a stroke of luck.",
            "Having called this place home for about a decade, I feel I can share some insights. Initially, moving to my current neighborhood was difficult. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge was emotional, and I shed tears missing my old friends and surroundings. However, my parents made the decision with my sister and me in mind, seeking better housing and education opportunities. Our new area had a reputation for being more upscale compared to our previous home. Over time, I adjusted to the change, making both friends and a few rivals at school. My relationship with neighbors remained limited, except for the bond we formed with Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family, and I cherish our connection. A memorable event was attending Mr. Glen’s wedding when he remarried. It was a joyous occasion, filled with laughter and dancing, giving me a glimpse of what I hope to achieve in my own future—a successful life and a happy marriage. I even caught the garter, although not the bouquet! That night was particularly special as I danced with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, whom I haven't seen since. I wish her well in her journey. \n\nThe layout of our neighborhood is complex, but with GPS, I explore more freely now. My adventures have mostly been with friends like Kason and Curtis, with whom I spent countless hours playing video games and savoring life. Occasionally, I find solace in our local park, enjoying nature’s calming influence. There, I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and engage in some light swordplay with my bokken. These activities bring me joy. Our community also offers basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a while. It’s reassuring to know they’re available if I decide to return to the sport. My father introduced my best friend and me to tennis, and with Mr. Graves' coaching, we had our share of rigorous yet fun sessions. Reflecting on my time here, I realize there have been numerous memorable moments, but these stand out the most. I’m optimistic about what the future holds.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming little town that might not catch your eye at first glance but plays a pivotal role in the agricultural scene. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, a claim boldly displayed on its welcoming sign. This town is predominantly covered in farmland, with either peach orchards or cattle pastures dominating the landscape. Houses outside the central area are generously spaced, often two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to fend off the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Typically, these homes are set back from the main roads, with front fields dedicated to livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, a solitary traffic light presides over a four-way intersection, surrounded by the town’s only stores. For quick bites, there’s Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger joint. A pizzeria once existed here but has since closed its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is well-loved for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's lone, albeit pricey, grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Many residents prefer to drive to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for the bulk of their groceries, stopping at IGA for just a few items. Dollar General is the town's busiest spot, offering a wide range of everyday goods and bustling from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store run by a community-favorite lady, has been around for years and even offers delivery by two movers. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both the doctor's office and veterinary clinic are located away from the town's core, yet they are well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only elementary institution, with middle and high school students commuting to the next town. Though technically devoid of parks, plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family outings and attract visitors or new residents. While entertainment options are limited—no theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or diverse dining—the town’s simplicity is its charm, so much so that you could easily pass through without noticing!",
            "Residing in a typical suburban setting within a quaint town in Tennessee, my home is situated on a road that connects two state highways. This results in more traffic than preferred, yet the neighborhood remains mostly peaceful. The community is stable, with few residents moving in or out, allowing us to become well-acquainted with our neighbors. Many people spend their time tending to their yards and taking care of daily tasks. In the colder months, sledding down the hill on our adjacent street becomes a fun activity. Our house is located at the street's front corner, giving us a clear view of the daily comings and goings, and we recognize most of the vehicles. Unfamiliar cars catch our attention. Neighbors often walk, either for exercise or while walking their dogs, and children can be seen riding bikes, typical of suburban life. As we work from home, my wife and I, along with our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, spend a significant amount of time at home. Consequently, the neighbors have grown accustomed to our presence as well. We often enjoy playing outside, even if it's raining. Occasionally, we grill on our back deck, with the barbecue's aroma filling the air pleasantly. From March to October, lawnmowers are a common sound, as residents regularly maintain their yards. Originally a forested region, our area boasts abundant trees, providing shade but also a significant leaf cleanup during fall. The smell of burning leaves, which I find pleasant, signals the arrival of autumn. Recent winters have been mild, making the season feel like an extended fall. Our garage, located at the back of the house, means the front door is infrequently used unless someone rings the bell, an uncommon occurrence. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a serene atmosphere, though Thanksgiving and other occasions like Mother's Day and Christmas see an influx of visiting families, resulting in additional parked cars. Overall, I am fond of living here, and it would be ideal if it weren't a through street.",
            "Nestled in the heart of the high desert, my neighborhood is surrounded by endless stretches of arid land. The landscape is dominated by shades of brown, and unless you’ve lived here, it’s hard to grasp the monotony of this view. Spotting a green lawn is rare, and when you do, it’s clear that maintaining it requires considerable investment. In the 90s, when I first moved here, homes were widely spaced. That hasn’t changed much, although there are more new developments now. The area is gradually taking on a more urban feel, a trend seen in many places. The community is generally welcoming, though, like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood is surrounded by amiable elderly folks, which makes it quite pleasant. The local stores are mostly chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you'll have to venture farther away, as options like Whole Foods are scarce. Construction appears to be the dominant industry here, possibly because there's still plenty of undeveloped land. This prospect is somewhat unsettling for me, as I prefer the current state of things, having left a bustling city behind. My career is in construction as a drywall and T-bar installer. One aspect I appreciate about living here is the wildlife. Many are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty. The unique climate and terrain create challenging ecosystems that are home to diverse wildlife, which requires protection. Residents should take time to understand and coexist with these non-human neighbors. My family has embraced the local fauna; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects and are often outside trying to catch them. As for attractions, there are a few. Victorville offers families a chance to explore the desert environment, providing a unique experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a delightful mix of activities and entertainment. Nearby Wrightwood offers snowy mountain views and winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the evolution of Victorville’s society and industry.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response might stand out as a bit different. While many who answer this question are likely homeowners with their own distinct lives, my circumstances are slightly unconventional. I think of my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the people in my dormitory as my immediate community. I also consider the broader campus area as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with the traditional conceptions of a neighborhood. Just like any regular neighborhood, mine has residences, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by looking at the “houses” that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it’s important to outline the types of housing available in my area. There are three main housing types close by: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory buildings. First, in the apartments, typically 2-4 individuals occupy each room, with about 4-6 rooms on a floor. Most buildings feature about 2 floors, so roughly 20 people reside in each building. Next, there are the actual houses, which are accessible for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. These are generally 2-4 bedroom configurations, often occupied by alumni. However, these types of houses are less numerous, as they are not as space-efficient. Lastly, there are the typical dorm rooms that accommodate hundreds of students. In these, two people usually share a room, with some exceptions, making it the most prevalent form of housing in my neighborhood. With housing addressed, let’s move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity, and this is evident in my neighborhood’s demographics. There are individuals from various cultures and age groups living here. Most of the professional staff reside in the neighborhood’s houses, while newer students occupy dormitory-style housing and older students tend to live in apartment-style housing. It’s hard to capture the essence of the people in my neighborhood with just words, so it’s best to proceed to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as its own self-contained neighborhood, it boasts numerous stores and a single park. The stores consist of dining options you’d find in any other neighborhood, along with the school’s unique clothing and grocery outlets. As such, anything needed is readily available within the neighborhood’s limits! Furthermore, the park serves as a recreational area for the diverse community, maintained clean and safe by all neighborhood members!",
            "In my area, sidewalks are a rarity. The landscape slopes downward significantly, with my home perched atop the steepest hill in the vicinity. It's often dubbed the \"workout hill\" by locals due to the numerous joggers who tackle it as part of their exercise routine. With no sidewalks along my street, pedestrians share the road with vehicles. The road itself is riddled with potholes, making driving a bit dicey. Telephone and electrical wires crisscross above, giving off a frayed appearance. Frequent rainstorms lead to fallen branches that knock out power lines, resulting in a patchwork of repairs. Towering evergreen trees abound, though they're not universally loved. Many residents cut them down to clear the ocean view. That's why numerous homes are constructed high on the hill, featuring expansive glass facades to capture the bay's vista. The sunset casts a beautiful glow on the water, turning the sky a vibrant orange. However, cloudy skies prevail, often reducing sunlight to a mere haze. Overcast, damp days are the norm, encouraging moss to thrive on all surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, requiring a laborious three-hour cleaning session. Children are scarce in my neighborhood despite a school nearby; most residents are older and retired. Dogs are more common than kids, often lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leaving a door or window open might invite an unexpected canine visitor indoors—I once had to gently escort one out of my living room. Wild rabbits roam freely, much to the dismay of gardeners who find their lawns uprooted. My cats, however, enjoy hunting them, keeping their numbers in check. Our avian visitors include sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, until they're driven away by the resident crows. While there are no shops in the neighborhood, a trek downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The shore lacks a sandy beach, but the rocky edge invites stone-skipping. The bay isn't expansive; even through the mist, you can often see the far shore.",
            "If you intend to explore Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, rest assured that reaching it is quite straightforward! Public transit is highly accessible and remains a favored mode of travel in New York City. Bensonhurst retains an urban character, making you feel very much in the heart of New York City. As you wander through the area, expect to see a multitude of Asian shops dotting the landscape. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant increase in Asian residents in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll notice an Asian-owned establishment on nearly every block you traverse, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are quite popular among the locals due to their excellent food quality, lower prices, and notable convenience. For instance, there are four Asian supermarkets located within a two-minute walk from one another near my location, enhancing the ease of grocery shopping. While Bensonhurst has a strong Asian presence, it is, in fact, a diverse community with a mix of immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children. Many of the most significant and well-known businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there is a newly refurbished park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a spacious field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, playgrounds for children, swings, and even a water fountain for summertime fun. True to New York City, the parks here showcase remarkable diversity, providing a space where everyone can play and interact harmoniously. The neighborhood doesn't host many large corporate structures; instead, you will find co-op living buildings or condominium apartments, with two-family homes being the predominant type of residence. The community is generally friendly, albeit a bit loud. It's common to hear cars with booming music or engines revving as they pass by, which might serve as an unwelcome alarm clock. If you decide to visit at night, it's wise to stay alert. The area is relatively safe, but unpredictability can occur, with the potential for encounters with troublesome individuals. Personally, I've experienced bullying in this neighborhood in the past, including physical confrontations, though this was years ago. Recently, package theft has been an issue too. Despite regulations in New York City about cleaning up after dogs, compliance is lacking here. Each morning, you'll likely come across dog waste on your route to the train or the supermarket. My main annoyance is the frequent sight of dog waste on the sidewalks, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To get a sense of Portland, Oregon, you must first grasp the concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, painted on a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club (often pushing the boundaries of legality), is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s—a time when the city was less famous and costly, fostering vibrant and distinctive subcultures. For others, it serves as an invitation, a signal that in Portland, being called weird is a form of praise. Even with the arrival of wealthy Californians and the relentless construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always equate to being inclusive, but it does imply an openness to the unconventional. While Portland, like much of the country, depends heavily on goods from China and faces contemporary challenges, it boasts an array of ordinary elements. It has yoga sessions, hipsters, and corporate professionals. Perhaps the essence of weirdness here is a lighter approach to these norms. In my part of town, as in many others, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and during summer, free boxes. These boxes—often made of cardboard, but sometimes plastic—offer a serendipitous array of items someone no longer needs. More often than not, they hold a delightful surprise perfect for a passerby. Clothing and books are common finds, though almost anything might appear. This element of surprise walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the city's spirit. Or at least, it defines Portland for me. But I'm just one of the myriad of \"weird\" individuals here. Some locals would never consider picking their clothes from a street-side box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga sessions with live goats) or cheer for the Timbers, our soccer team. Portland is a melting pot of diverse passions and aspirations. Here, people chase their dreams, or perhaps fantasize about them while lingering too long at a bar. It's true that Portland faces challenges, such as drug issues often rooted in mental health struggles, exacerbated by the long, rainy, and cloudy seasons. Homelessness is another pressing issue, with no clear solution. The homeless are often drawn by Portland's relatively superior social services compared to other regions, though these services remain inadequate. The general populace oscillates between compassion and resentment. In this regard, we are quite typical.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast, always present. In the north, they observe each sunrise and sunset with unwavering patience. Even when I am so engrossed in the busyness of life that I neglect their presence, they remain unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress weighs heavily on me, they insist on being noticed, and in their presence, I find a calm for my restless mind and gain the strength to persevere, each day as it comes. When I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, it was the northern mountains that captured my attention. The university has its own allure with its impressive architecture, tranquil ponds, and lush trees, each holding a special place in my heart. Yet, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme in my affections. The town itself is charming, home to numerous cafés where countless hours were spent studying amidst the aroma of coffee. A short walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where old brick buildings create an atmosphere rich with history, giving this suburban town a lively energy comparable to its nearby urban counterpart. However, this bustling area quickly fades, allowing one to return to the peacefulness of small-town life by simply passing the library. This close-knit blend of contrasting environments offers the city an inviting charm, as if it’s inviting exploration. Here, one can easily form fond memories, each tied to different parts of the town. Whether it’s strolling past the aging swings in the park with friends after pulling an all-nighter or dashing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university, each experience is unique. Of course, like any place, it also holds its share of difficult memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as a place for both deep contemplation and tearful reflections during moments of existential crisis, something I am quite familiar with. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects going about their lives, each fulfilling some role, I often pondered my own purpose as I navigated the complexities of life. So, I would walk past the pond, through the park, and beyond the suburban homes until reaching a main street. It was then that the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees and painted the sky, and looking up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, unchanged as ever. The imposing mountains rose above the hazy blue and yellow sky, more prominent than any building on the horizon, and in their silent presence, they reignited my determination.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it. It's tucked away in a residential area behind a shopping center, not exactly where you'd expect people to live. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and head behind the hotels—mostly empty except for a few summer family reunions—you'll discover a lively community. This neighborhood, nestled on these streets, features several apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged in a row. The first set of apartments has garnered some media attention for unsavory issues, so we'll skip over those—appearances can often be misleading. Adjacent to those, and the next two complexes, lies a hidden world unknown to many locals. Opposite these complexes is a satellite campus of a community college, a tranquil collection of buildings where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning as early as 7 AM to start their day. The gates creak open, letting them in one at a time, while irritated drivers complain about the traffic delays on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. The center has cheerful porch seating and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Across the street, children play in the park, running across the grass while bees buzz around flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, scowling at skateboarders and nodding politely to teenage girls chatting by the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant in a strip mall offers affordable food yet remains uncrowded, next to a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor hibachi chicken all in one stop—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where park-goers often hold chilly cups topped with various treats, performing skateboard tricks and vaping as they see it as trendy. This neighborhood captures a slice of small-town America, a place in the unhurried South where time seems to stand still.",
            "The neighborhood I live in has its own unique charm. Most of the residences are standalone houses, but some have been cleverly divided into two attached units. My house features a modest yard at the front and a small driveway to the left. Like many others here, it harks back to an era when suburban living was synonymous with the American dream. Although this dream seems to be fading, my neighborhood and others like it continue to hold onto its essence, welcoming visitors with a reminder that the dream persists. People here may not feel as hopeful as before, and the gardens are not as meticulously maintained, yet driveways are still occupied by a car or two, and children continue to play as if their surroundings are their entire world. The public school, with its nearly 90-year history, stands as a beacon for the future generation, stirring nostalgia among older residents. While churches are sparsely scattered and often empty, the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has a distinct appearance, but they all share a common feel. There's a large supermarket named Super \"A,\" run by a Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the area. The majority of the population is African American. The streets are broad, allowing children to play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many families have lived here for generations, sharing stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but as interest in karate waned with the decline in related movies, it transformed into a pharmacy, a nod to the belief that medicine solves all, or so the saying goes. A small movie theater screens classic films at a lower price, shunned by the youth for its lack of new releases but cherished by older residents as an affordable night out without the kids. An expressway runs through our town, but the entry and exit ramps are in the neighboring town. A petition for an exit in our town was supported by the younger residents, while the elders opposed it, fearing it would disrupt our community, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the proposal. A new high school is underway, and we're in the process of selecting a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin, as it truly captures the spirit of our town.",
            "Living in a bustling metropolis means my neighborhood is a true melting pot of cultures and lifestyles. The residential zones are interspersed with commercial districts, featuring an array of businesses including offices, shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's no end to the new dining spots or shopping experiences, ranging from large, familiar retail chains to charming small boutiques. These smaller stores are increasingly drawing attention, not only in shopping centers but also along the streets, which are conveniently close to otherwise peaceful residential areas. Nearby parks offer a retreat where families often enjoy time with their children. My neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity, showcasing a vibrant mix of communities, such as a notable LGBTQ+ presence, an Orthodox Jewish enclave, and a group of former Soviet Union immigrants and refugees. Venturing slightly beyond, the cultural diversity blossoms further, with distinct areas like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia just a few miles away. However, navigating these distances can be time-consuming due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours, making a 10-mile journey last up to two hours. Despite the close proximity of various attractions, the city's vastness discourages walking as the main mode of transport, leading to notoriously congested roads and scarce parking. Ironically, the city is seeing a boom in construction, with new apartment complexes rising despite residents' concerns about increasing population density and traffic woes. Housing in the city is varied, with options ranging from large apartment complexes to smaller homes and condos. Some areas feature single-family houses, while others have duplexes, adding to the diversity of living arrangements. My immediate neighborhood reflects this variety, with people of different ages and backgrounds. Despite this, I am not well-acquainted with most of my neighbors, as the community isn't as close-knit as it once was. I fondly recall childhood days playing outdoors with my next-door neighbor and a few friends of similar age, but those interactions seem less common now.",
            "As we cruised by the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" anticipating her surprise at the vast emptiness surrounding us. Coming from a place where the grocery store was just a five-minute stroll away, she had never experienced such expansive open space. The sight of the endless cornfields was a revelation, and I shared with her what life was like growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she truly began to understand who I was and the environment that shaped me. Traveling down a narrow country road, we eventually reached a quarry brimming with water. Just beyond this landmark lies the modest neighborhood where I reside. The homes are primarily constructed of brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre, which residents take great pride in maintaining. Springtime brings an abundance of freshly planted flowers alongside the Midwestern trees that transform with the seasons. Driveways gleam with high-end Mercedes Benz cars, polished to shine beneath the midday sun after a thorough wash. As we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was outside, always with a welcoming smile. He often spends his days mowing his lawn, his voice harmonizing with the mower's hum. His presence brings joy to the neighborhood; despite aging and losing some sharpness, he remains genuine and intriguing. Previously a doctor, he now seamlessly blends with the grass on his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, we arrived at my home, where geese populate the side yard, playfully pursued by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, filling the air with the sounds of bullfrogs, flowing water, and the occasional cow's moo from distant farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched sanctuary of wild trees, herbs, and flowers. This is where I spent much of my youth, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them, always with a neighborhood friend nearby. Winters in our town can be harsh, yet they bring a unique beauty. The yard shifts from a green sea to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant blossoms now stand as stark skeletons. When snow graces us, a magical scene emerges overnight. The backyard becomes a canvas for snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. Our childhood quarrels were fought with snowballs, constructed in massive igloo-like forts built with branches, ready for battle. In our private winter world, we indulged in make-believe, a time when nothing else mattered. We were simply carefree kids, lost in our own adventures."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Nestled in the heart of Rural America lies my home, a small town in Michigan where vast farmlands transition seamlessly into quaint tourist destinations. This area lacks the bustling energy of large city malls, as well as chain stores like Wal-Mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s—every destination requires a drive. Yet, the location is nothing short of stunning, as it's enveloped by water. The town is flanked by the breathtaking Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other, offering countless beaches for a leisurely stroll or a refreshing dip. My neighborhood epitomizes the essence of a small town. Here, homes aren't crammed together or mass-produced; they are unique, with some having been modernized while others retain their vintage charm. Most houses boast full, visible basements and display a variety of colors with their classic aluminum siding. Each property often features a yard, complete with trampolines, playsets, and sometimes gardens or animal enclosures. This community reflects the spirit of Middle America—diligent individuals nurturing or having nurtured families. On any given day, children can be seen playing in the streets, while residents walk their dogs, cycle, or rollerblade. There's a strong sense of familiarity among neighbors, easily identifying who belongs and who doesn't. It’s common to exchange waves with someone grilling outside or share a friendly smile with a dog walker from another block. Lawns are well-maintained, free of autumn leaves, with neatly trimmed grass, plants, and bushes. While it may not be the most picturesque neighborhood, it exudes warmth and is clearly a wonderful place to raise a family. It's a quiet, peaceful, and secure environment. Though modest in appearance, it embodies the universal desire for a safe haven at the day’s end. Nearby, within walking distance, are the county sheriff's office and jail, the health department, and the city recycling center, all serving the local community. Close by are baseball and softball fields, where the sounds of announcers can be heard echoing names and scores. The small town airport is adjacent, and the gentle hum of small planes taking off and landing is a familiar backdrop. A local ice cream shop offers a sweet treat within strolling distance, and for those who enjoy a walk, downtown is accessible from our neighborhood. My children can easily bike to a park that’s just about eight blocks away. It truly is a wonderful place to call home.",
            "The place where I reside can be summed up as a classic example of suburban living. In my specific neighborhood, the influence of a homeowner’s association is quite noticeable. As you enter, you’re greeted by rows of neatly kept single-family homes, a testament to the homeowner’s association’s efforts. The front lawns bear a striking similarity: small patches of manicured grass, decorative stones, and relatively short driveways. Occasionally, you might see a few small trees. Each home comes with a two-car garage. As you drive around, you’ll observe the freshly paved roads, which are impressively maintained despite the many families who live here. You won’t encounter any potholes or damage. Most of the homes are one-story, although there are occasional two-story ones. Unlike typical single-family homes, we don’t have individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, there’s a cluster of mailboxes at the street’s end, similar to an apartment setup. Residents use a key to access their mailbox, and there are two bigger lockers for packages. This uniformity is another result of the HOA’s regulations. My house is situated on the outskirts of a nearby city, making our neighborhood a mix of rural and suburban. Consequently, we have ample space for various activities. There are several community pools, accessible to all residents, which are well-maintained and enclosed. Additionally, there are walking trails for dog walks or solo evening strolls. You don’t need to visit a park for exercise; the neighborhood is expansive enough to jog around for a good workout. The community predominantly consists of retired individuals, creating a safe and watchful environment. There are also a few middle-aged and young professionals. As for the city, it’s surprisingly populous but still retains a small-town vibe. It provides nearly all the essential amenities. For instance, there’s one mall—not enormous, but functional. For me, it takes about 15 minutes to drive to key locations, but once there, a variety of stores are available. Everything from upscale grocery stores with organic options to discount outlets with limited selections and minimal staff for cost efficiency can be found. Overall, my neighborhood is secure, well-kept, and fairly standard. We enjoy amenities like pools and trails, and while we’re not immediately adjacent to shopping areas, a short drive connects us to major retail chains.",
            "The first I learned about my apartment was through a podcast discussing missing persons cases. It came as a bit of a surprise. Most apartments in the vicinity are priced well over a thousand dollars a month. None of my friends or I had heard anything about the story. Perhaps it's the hardship. Some of my friends find themselves in tears before falling asleep. Life is costly, but over the years, we've mastered the art of thriftiness. You start to appreciate the musty aroma of toys from flea markets and clothes with mothball scents. As adults, we seem to smell less. You might take up smoking, or maybe you just grow used to the way things are. Yet, the flea market remains a constant. The scent of adulthood is like dusty magazines piled on a closed piano. It embeds itself in leather and lingers even after washing. Here, there are three thrift stores within walking distance. If you begin at the far end, you can visit two charity thrift shops, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is bustling, with cars and people filling the streets every morning, yet you'd never hear it inside the thrifts. Regardless of the number of people or cars passing by, the stores remain quiet. They're perfect for losing an afternoon. Each year, more people and cars flood in. It's a city in development, they say. Although it hosts the headquarters of a major online commerce and delivery giant, it's still experiencing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everyone is focused on their own ambitions, and not much is expected from you. You can be solitary, silent, and independent, and people will respect your space. It's unlike the South, where showing concern signifies care. Here, people don't intrude into your life. You can maintain your privacy as long as you wish, and the city will ebb and flow like waves on a shore. It's a vibrant place to be. With a pianist living next door and two amateur singers upstairs, there's always something happening. In a way, our apartment isn't just a collection of strangers but a community of friends. We gather for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn losses, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm fortunate to be here. I genuinely like most of my neighbors, and they treat me well. I make an effort to keep my space tidy and share food, and they reciprocate. We exchange mail for one another. It's nice to see them, and I think they enjoy my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I reside in a vast, impersonal modernist expanse, but people like my neighbors make me feel that I haven't completely messed up my life.",
            "I reside in a modest Midwestern town situated just beyond the suburban reach of a sizable city. My neighborhood, positioned on the eastern side of town, is considered the most economically challenged area. Property prices here are quite low, with most homes being either rented or owned by individuals with limited incomes. Nonetheless, the area is far from unattractive or unpleasant. The people living nearby are generally amicable and often exchange smiles and greetings as I stroll down the street. Although crime rates are slightly higher than other parts of the town, they remain relatively low. In the past decade, a few violent incidents have occurred within a few blocks from my house, including several shootings and at least one fatality. Tragically, our next-door neighbors lost their son to a shooting outside a local bar last year. Luckily, our family hasn't been directly impacted by crime, except for the occasional item disappearing from our porch when we forget to bring it in. The town itself has been deeply touched by the \"opioid epidemic\" that has swept across many regions of the United States, with numerous lives lost to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are several resources available in town to tackle this issue, such as addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for those supporting individuals with addiction. Despite these difficulties, the town boasts many positive qualities. My son's elementary school has an outstanding team, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Even with his special needs, he has not experienced any bullying, thanks to the school's incredibly positive environment, and he absolutely loves attending. We have a proactive PTO that organizes various events throughout the year to encourage family involvement and educational advancement. Given that over 20% of the town's residents live below the poverty line, the elementary school offers free breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry. No family or child is regarded as \"less than\" due to financial constraints, and the costs associated with school fees, supplies, and field trips are quite reasonable. The City Council and staff have undertaken several beautification projects in town, including road resurfacing, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Regrettably, most of these improvements have been concentrated in the town center and on the west side, where shopping areas are located and most traffic flows. The east side, where I live, tends to be overlooked, which is a sore point among my neighbors. On the whole, I enjoy residing in this town. The people are generally friendly, the schools are excellent, there are sufficient shopping options (ranging from small businesses to larger retail outlets) to satisfy my family's needs, and while our home might not be of high value, it is comfortable and sufficient. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot envision calling any other place home.",
            "My neighborhood is teeming with diverse cultural influences. Perched atop a hill, it's surrounded by buildings that hold historical significance. I reside in a seven-story apartment building directly opposite the old live theater, and just a block down the hill lies a fascinating arcade bar that attracts a variety of people during warm summer evenings. On weekends in June and July, it's common to see a line of people eagerly waiting to enter. A few blocks in the opposite direction is the nearest city park, surprisingly large given its urban location. Surrounding the park is a concrete border with tall steps built into it. During the cold winter months, homeless individuals line the sidewalks and wide steps with their tents in neat rows. Though snow is rare, the heavy rain that falls mid-winter makes it challenging to stay warm. By setting their tents close together in the heart of the city rather than in more isolated areas, they manage to keep warmer and remain within walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can access bathing facilities.\n\nWhat truly endears my city to me is not just its historical charm—the towering buildings and the architecture spread across the hills leading to the ocean—but the vibrant culture of its people. Hilltop, once notorious for gang violence on the West Coast, still carries stories from those times, even three decades later, when federal officials and the DEA attempted to clean up the streets. These stories persist through generations and reach newcomers like me. Despite its reputation as one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city, the community works hard to maintain its cleanliness and stay informed about local happenings. There's an old saying that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around Hilltop after dark. I believe this caution harks back to earlier times and carries the weight of social conditioning. Perhaps my ambiguous appearance helps me blend in, or maybe Hilltop sees me as one of their own, someone who understands the persistent issues of racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions rooted in ignorance and fear, even in a city celebrated as a cultural melting pot. No matter how far I travel, Hilltop remains my home. Walking those streets at night invigorates me, meeting people who are more likely to offer me a jacket than harm me. It's a place where laundromat owners graciously keep their doors open a bit longer so I can charge my phone when there's no other refuge from the rain. It's a place where, even on the dreariest of nights, someone will stop, look me in the eye, hand me a five-dollar bill, and remind me that I am beautiful and valuable.",
            "I relocated to this area just as I was beginning eighth grade. Initially, forming friendships was a challenge, but eventually, I became close with a neighbor two doors down and another person on my street. Although they no longer reside here, the memories remain vivid. Most of the original residents are still around. My neighborhood resembles a typical American suburb, with many two-story homes. On warm weekends, the sound of children playing fills the air. Generally, the area is quiet during the week. I've never had any issues with the residents; everyone respects your space unless assistance is needed. I've ordered numerous items online, and none have ever been taken from my porch, which makes me feel secure with my neighbors. A park is just a short walk away, where I've accumulated many memories. I've played various sports there, and despite a bad experience of getting an elbow to the nose while playing football, the positive memories outweigh the negative. These days, I visit the park with my cousin's young children, who enjoy the swings and slides. The park now evokes a sense of nostalgia for me. The neighborhood is quite diverse, offering a variety of cuisines within a mile, including Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian options. Many people now use delivery apps like GrubHub and DoorDash. Fast food outlets are the most popular, as expected in most suburbs, along with numerous pizza places. The local stores provide all necessities, with several dry cleaners, a Walgreens, a CVS, and a Jewel-Osco, a well-known Midwest grocery chain, all nearby. There's even an Indian-owned store for anyone interested in cooking or buying Indian food. I genuinely appreciate my neighborhood, especially after hearing about the difficulties others face with their neighbors on social media and the news. It makes me truly grateful for my own experience here.",
            "The neighborhood where I reside is conveniently close to the college I attend, which adds to the enjoyment of living here. The area is predominantly filled with apartment buildings, along with some restaurants and bars that offer a good time without being too pricey. One of the bars recently underwent a name change; though it’s pricier, the quality of service and drinks isn't disappointing. The community generally consists of friendly individuals, mostly college students or those with lower incomes, as the apartments are affordably priced. An elementary school nearby brings many children to the vicinity. While I haven't formed relationships with my neighbors, I'm not particularly inclined to, as they frequently smoke cannabis. This led the building management to install an air freshener unit opposite their door, which my boyfriend and I find amusing yet somewhat offensive. Although the buildings around me often appear aged, they might have updated interiors. Further down the street are newer apartments that I dislike due to their poor construction despite high rents, which seem exploitative given their proximity to campus. About five minutes away is an inexpensive eatery that serves meals on paper plates, primarily using microwaved food. Across from it lies a gas station reputed to be an undesirable workplace. However, a city grant allowed for road improvements last summer, resulting in a wide sidewalk and landscaped medians, enhancing the area's appeal. My apartment is surrounded by trees, though some were recently cut, leaving stumps, but there are still more trees here than further down the street. Behind my apartment is a tree line, followed by another apartment complex. I reside on 42nd Street, while 43rd Street, just behind, is less appealing with deteriorating sidewalks and rundown buildings, which the trees might be intended to conceal. Crime is mostly associated with an apartment complex on that street, although there's also considerable crime and a transient community across from me. Despite these issues, I find my living situation satisfactory due to its affordability and the abundance of nearby amenities. I particularly appreciate the university's walking distance and the two bus stops that facilitate easy access to the store and downtown.",
            "In my neighborhood, you'll find duplexes arranged along a cul-de-sac, spaced out so they resemble standalone homes. Each one sports a yellow hue, complemented by white porches and green metal roofs. Most residents are friendly with one another, often gathering in the evenings at the end of random driveways to chat while kids play with toys, sidewalk chalk, or kites. This simple camaraderie is a refreshing escape from our technology-driven lives, almost like a glimpse into the past. Surrounded by fields and trees, with blue skies and fluffy clouds overhead, it’s quite picturesque. However, this season brought tornado warnings, and last night, for the first time, the sirens went off, prompting us to seek shelter. I found myself in the bathtub, holding my smallest dog, my purse, and some pillows. My larger dog, uneasy with the situation, stayed in the living room, barking nervously. The neighborhood was eerily quiet, aside from the sound of large hailstones hitting the ground. After the storm, the road steamed from the rapid temperature drop, from 92 to 75 degrees in minutes, causing the hail to melt instantly on the warm pavement. As the skies started to clear, the sun peeked through, and it began to rain, revealing a double rainbow. I rushed inside to grab my camera and snapped photos to share on Facebook, where friends and family marveled alongside me. The streets stayed silent for about an hour until people returned home after the thunderstorm passed. Then, life resumed its usual pace, with moms and kids outside while dinner was prepared. This welcoming neighborhood is a delight for someone like me who recently moved from New Hampshire to North Carolina. I love hearing the southern accent. My apartment, like all others here, has two bedrooms and two baths, though the interiors vary. Some are surprisingly small, which puzzles me. I enjoy walking through the expansive field behind my place and heading to the pond, even though it's not for swimming. Deer sightings are common, and in the morning, the sound of a bullfrog fills the air. Living just forty minutes from Charlotte, it’s a fantastic place to call home. Roosters crow each morning from nearby farms, adding to the village-like atmosphere. We even have a donkey nearby who brays in the evening, reminding us of his presence. Finding this charming neighborhood was a stroke of luck.",
            "Having called this place home for about a decade, I feel I can share some insights. Initially, moving to my current neighborhood was difficult. Leaving Riverdale for Stockbridge was emotional, and I shed tears missing my old friends and surroundings. However, my parents made the decision with my sister and me in mind, seeking better housing and education opportunities. Our new area had a reputation for being more upscale compared to our previous home. Over time, I adjusted to the change, making both friends and a few rivals at school. My relationship with neighbors remained limited, except for the bond we formed with Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived next door. They became like family, and I cherish our connection. A memorable event was attending Mr. Glen’s wedding when he remarried. It was a joyous occasion, filled with laughter and dancing, giving me a glimpse of what I hope to achieve in my own future—a successful life and a happy marriage. I even caught the garter, although not the bouquet! That night was particularly special as I danced with Marsharii, one of Mr. Glen's daughters, whom I haven't seen since. I wish her well in her journey. \n\nThe layout of our neighborhood is complex, but with GPS, I explore more freely now. My adventures have mostly been with friends like Kason and Curtis, with whom I spent countless hours playing video games and savoring life. Occasionally, I find solace in our local park, enjoying nature’s calming influence. There, I practice balance with sticks from Home Depot and engage in some light swordplay with my bokken. These activities bring me joy. Our community also offers basketball and tennis courts, though I haven't played in a while. It’s reassuring to know they’re available if I decide to return to the sport. My father introduced my best friend and me to tennis, and with Mr. Graves' coaching, we had our share of rigorous yet fun sessions. Reflecting on my time here, I realize there have been numerous memorable moments, but these stand out the most. I’m optimistic about what the future holds.",
            "Nestled in South Carolina, my neighborhood is a charming little town that might not catch your eye at first glance but plays a pivotal role in the agricultural scene. Johnston proudly calls itself the Peach Capital of the World, a claim boldly displayed on its welcoming sign. This town is predominantly covered in farmland, with either peach orchards or cattle pastures dominating the landscape. Houses outside the central area are generously spaced, often two stories high, featuring either metal roofs to fend off the intense summer heat or gray shingles. Typically, these homes are set back from the main roads, with front fields dedicated to livestock or crops. In the heart of the town, a solitary traffic light presides over a four-way intersection, surrounded by the town’s only stores. For quick bites, there’s Hong Kong, a small family-run Chinese eatery, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, a local burger joint. A pizzeria once existed here but has since closed its doors. Maxwell and Halford Drug, a tiny family-owned pharmacy, is well-loved for its Cherry Coca-Cola. The town's lone, albeit pricey, grocery store is the Independent Grocers Alliance, or IGA. Many residents prefer to drive to Batesburg-Leesville's Walmart for the bulk of their groceries, stopping at IGA for just a few items. Dollar General is the town's busiest spot, offering a wide range of everyday goods and bustling from open to close. Possibilities Furniture & More, a small furniture store run by a community-favorite lady, has been around for years and even offers delivery by two movers. Attached to it is Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a pet grooming service offering daycare, boarding, grooming, and more. Both the doctor's office and veterinary clinic are located away from the town's core, yet they are well-equipped to serve Johnston's residents. Johnston Elementary School is the only elementary institution, with middle and high school students commuting to the next town. Though technically devoid of parks, plans are underway to develop a 2.5-acre recreational area to enhance family outings and attract visitors or new residents. While entertainment options are limited—no theaters, bowling alleys, hangout spots, playgrounds, or diverse dining—the town’s simplicity is its charm, so much so that you could easily pass through without noticing!",
            "Residing in a typical suburban setting within a quaint town in Tennessee, my home is situated on a road that connects two state highways. This results in more traffic than preferred, yet the neighborhood remains mostly peaceful. The community is stable, with few residents moving in or out, allowing us to become well-acquainted with our neighbors. Many people spend their time tending to their yards and taking care of daily tasks. In the colder months, sledding down the hill on our adjacent street becomes a fun activity. Our house is located at the street's front corner, giving us a clear view of the daily comings and goings, and we recognize most of the vehicles. Unfamiliar cars catch our attention. Neighbors often walk, either for exercise or while walking their dogs, and children can be seen riding bikes, typical of suburban life. As we work from home, my wife and I, along with our two daughters, aged eleven and fourteen, spend a significant amount of time at home. Consequently, the neighbors have grown accustomed to our presence as well. We often enjoy playing outside, even if it's raining. Occasionally, we grill on our back deck, with the barbecue's aroma filling the air pleasantly. From March to October, lawnmowers are a common sound, as residents regularly maintain their yards. Originally a forested region, our area boasts abundant trees, providing shade but also a significant leaf cleanup during fall. The smell of burning leaves, which I find pleasant, signals the arrival of autumn. Recent winters have been mild, making the season feel like an extended fall. Our garage, located at the back of the house, means the front door is infrequently used unless someone rings the bell, an uncommon occurrence. I enjoy working on my truck or other projects in the garage, and with the doors open, I feel more connected to the neighborhood. Holidays bring a serene atmosphere, though Thanksgiving and other occasions like Mother's Day and Christmas see an influx of visiting families, resulting in additional parked cars. Overall, I am fond of living here, and it would be ideal if it weren't a through street.",
            "Nestled in the heart of the high desert, my neighborhood is surrounded by endless stretches of arid land. The landscape is dominated by shades of brown, and unless you’ve lived here, it’s hard to grasp the monotony of this view. Spotting a green lawn is rare, and when you do, it’s clear that maintaining it requires considerable investment. In the 90s, when I first moved here, homes were widely spaced. That hasn’t changed much, although there are more new developments now. The area is gradually taking on a more urban feel, a trend seen in many places. The community is generally welcoming, though, like any city, it has its ups and downs. My neighborhood is surrounded by amiable elderly folks, which makes it quite pleasant. The local stores are mostly chain outlets like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For upscale shopping, you'll have to venture farther away, as options like Whole Foods are scarce. Construction appears to be the dominant industry here, possibly because there's still plenty of undeveloped land. This prospect is somewhat unsettling for me, as I prefer the current state of things, having left a bustling city behind. My career is in construction as a drywall and T-bar installer. One aspect I appreciate about living here is the wildlife. Many are drawn to the high desert for its stark beauty. The unique climate and terrain create challenging ecosystems that are home to diverse wildlife, which requires protection. Residents should take time to understand and coexist with these non-human neighbors. My family has embraced the local fauna; my three children are fascinated by lizards and desert insects and are often outside trying to catch them. As for attractions, there are a few. Victorville offers families a chance to explore the desert environment, providing a unique experience. If you can, visit during the San Bernardino County Fair, which adds a delightful mix of activities and entertainment. Nearby Wrightwood offers snowy mountain views and winter sports lessons. If you're interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert, the Victor Valley Museum showcases geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical items that narrate the evolution of Victorville’s society and industry.",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, my response might stand out as a bit different. While many who answer this question are likely homeowners with their own distinct lives, my circumstances are slightly unconventional. I think of my neighborhood as the college campus where I reside, with the people in my dormitory as my immediate community. I also consider the broader campus area as part of my neighborhood, though to a lesser degree. Despite this uniqueness, my neighborhood shares similarities with the traditional conceptions of a neighborhood. Just like any regular neighborhood, mine has residences, people, shops, and parks. Let’s start by looking at the “houses” that make up my neighborhood. Before delving into the specifics, it’s important to outline the types of housing available in my area. There are three main housing types close by: apartments, actual houses, and dormitory buildings. First, in the apartments, typically 2-4 individuals occupy each room, with about 4-6 rooms on a floor. Most buildings feature about 2 floors, so roughly 20 people reside in each building. Next, there are the actual houses, which are accessible for anyone affiliated with the school to rent. These are generally 2-4 bedroom configurations, often occupied by alumni. However, these types of houses are less numerous, as they are not as space-efficient. Lastly, there are the typical dorm rooms that accommodate hundreds of students. In these, two people usually share a room, with some exceptions, making it the most prevalent form of housing in my neighborhood. With housing addressed, let’s move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity, and this is evident in my neighborhood’s demographics. There are individuals from various cultures and age groups living here. Most of the professional staff reside in the neighborhood’s houses, while newer students occupy dormitory-style housing and older students tend to live in apartment-style housing. It’s hard to capture the essence of the people in my neighborhood with just words, so it’s best to proceed to the stores and parks. Since my school functions as its own self-contained neighborhood, it boasts numerous stores and a single park. The stores consist of dining options you’d find in any other neighborhood, along with the school’s unique clothing and grocery outlets. As such, anything needed is readily available within the neighborhood’s limits! Furthermore, the park serves as a recreational area for the diverse community, maintained clean and safe by all neighborhood members!",
            "In my area, sidewalks are a rarity. The landscape slopes downward significantly, with my home perched atop the steepest hill in the vicinity. It's often dubbed the \"workout hill\" by locals due to the numerous joggers who tackle it as part of their exercise routine. With no sidewalks along my street, pedestrians share the road with vehicles. The road itself is riddled with potholes, making driving a bit dicey. Telephone and electrical wires crisscross above, giving off a frayed appearance. Frequent rainstorms lead to fallen branches that knock out power lines, resulting in a patchwork of repairs. Towering evergreen trees abound, though they're not universally loved. Many residents cut them down to clear the ocean view. That's why numerous homes are constructed high on the hill, featuring expansive glass facades to capture the bay's vista. The sunset casts a beautiful glow on the water, turning the sky a vibrant orange. However, cloudy skies prevail, often reducing sunlight to a mere haze. Overcast, damp days are the norm, encouraging moss to thrive on all surfaces like roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car outside for a month, only to find it covered in green moss, requiring a laborious three-hour cleaning session. Children are scarce in my neighborhood despite a school nearby; most residents are older and retired. Dogs are more common than kids, often lounging on lawns or chasing each other down the street. Leaving a door or window open might invite an unexpected canine visitor indoors—I once had to gently escort one out of my living room. Wild rabbits roam freely, much to the dismay of gardeners who find their lawns uprooted. My cats, however, enjoy hunting them, keeping their numbers in check. Our avian visitors include sparrows, hummingbirds, and occasionally a hawk or eagle, until they're driven away by the resident crows. While there are no shops in the neighborhood, a trek downhill to the waterfront reveals a few seafood restaurants. The shore lacks a sandy beach, but the rocky edge invites stone-skipping. The bay isn't expansive; even through the mist, you can often see the far shore.",
            "If you intend to explore Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, rest assured that reaching it is quite straightforward! Public transit is highly accessible and remains a favored mode of travel in New York City. Bensonhurst retains an urban character, making you feel very much in the heart of New York City. As you wander through the area, expect to see a multitude of Asian shops dotting the landscape. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant increase in Asian residents in Bensonhurst. Consequently, you'll notice an Asian-owned establishment on nearly every block you traverse, with supermarkets and laundromats being particularly prevalent. These businesses are quite popular among the locals due to their excellent food quality, lower prices, and notable convenience. For instance, there are four Asian supermarkets located within a two-minute walk from one another near my location, enhancing the ease of grocery shopping. While Bensonhurst has a strong Asian presence, it is, in fact, a diverse community with a mix of immigrants and their first- and second-generation American children. Many of the most significant and well-known businesses in the area are Asian-owned. Besides these businesses, there is a newly refurbished park nearby, featuring around ten basketball courts, a spacious field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, playgrounds for children, swings, and even a water fountain for summertime fun. True to New York City, the parks here showcase remarkable diversity, providing a space where everyone can play and interact harmoniously. The neighborhood doesn't host many large corporate structures; instead, you will find co-op living buildings or condominium apartments, with two-family homes being the predominant type of residence. The community is generally friendly, albeit a bit loud. It's common to hear cars with booming music or engines revving as they pass by, which might serve as an unwelcome alarm clock. If you decide to visit at night, it's wise to stay alert. The area is relatively safe, but unpredictability can occur, with the potential for encounters with troublesome individuals. Personally, I've experienced bullying in this neighborhood in the past, including physical confrontations, though this was years ago. Recently, package theft has been an issue too. Despite regulations in New York City about cleaning up after dogs, compliance is lacking here. Each morning, you'll likely come across dog waste on your route to the train or the supermarket. My main annoyance is the frequent sight of dog waste on the sidewalks, so watch your step and keep your shoes clean!",
            "To get a sense of Portland, Oregon, you must first grasp the concept of \"weird.\" The city's unofficial motto, painted on a building that doubles as a pizza place, bar, music venue, and strip club (often pushing the boundaries of legality), is \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, this phrase is a nostalgic nod to the Portland of the 90s and early 2000s—a time when the city was less famous and costly, fostering vibrant and distinctive subcultures. For others, it serves as an invitation, a signal that in Portland, being called weird is a form of praise. Even with the arrival of wealthy Californians and the relentless construction of condos to accommodate them, Portland retains its weirdness. Being weird doesn't always equate to being inclusive, but it does imply an openness to the unconventional. While Portland, like much of the country, depends heavily on goods from China and faces contemporary challenges, it boasts an array of ordinary elements. It has yoga sessions, hipsters, and corporate professionals. Perhaps the essence of weirdness here is a lighter approach to these norms. In my part of town, as in many others, you'll find vibrant homes, streets lined with gardens of flowers, herbs, and vegetables, and during summer, free boxes. These boxes—often made of cardboard, but sometimes plastic—offer a serendipitous array of items someone no longer needs. More often than not, they hold a delightful surprise perfect for a passerby. Clothing and books are common finds, though almost anything might appear. This element of surprise walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the city's spirit. Or at least, it defines Portland for me. But I'm just one of the myriad of \"weird\" individuals here. Some locals would never consider picking their clothes from a street-side box. Instead, they might attend goat yoga (yes, yoga sessions with live goats) or cheer for the Timbers, our soccer team. Portland is a melting pot of diverse passions and aspirations. Here, people chase their dreams, or perhaps fantasize about them while lingering too long at a bar. It's true that Portland faces challenges, such as drug issues often rooted in mental health struggles, exacerbated by the long, rainy, and cloudy seasons. Homelessness is another pressing issue, with no clear solution. The homeless are often drawn by Portland's relatively superior social services compared to other regions, though these services remain inadequate. The general populace oscillates between compassion and resentment. In this regard, we are quite typical.",
            "The mountains stand steadfast, always present. In the north, they observe each sunrise and sunset with unwavering patience. Even when I am so engrossed in the busyness of life that I neglect their presence, they remain unaffected by life's challenges. On days when stress weighs heavily on me, they insist on being noticed, and in their presence, I find a calm for my restless mind and gain the strength to persevere, each day as it comes. When I first arrived here for my undergraduate studies, it was the northern mountains that captured my attention. The university has its own allure with its impressive architecture, tranquil ponds, and lush trees, each holding a special place in my heart. Yet, it is the mountains that truly reign supreme in my affections. The town itself is charming, home to numerous cafés where countless hours were spent studying amidst the aroma of coffee. A short walk or bus ride leads to the downtown area, where old brick buildings create an atmosphere rich with history, giving this suburban town a lively energy comparable to its nearby urban counterpart. However, this bustling area quickly fades, allowing one to return to the peacefulness of small-town life by simply passing the library. This close-knit blend of contrasting environments offers the city an inviting charm, as if it’s inviting exploration. Here, one can easily form fond memories, each tied to different parts of the town. Whether it’s strolling past the aging swings in the park with friends after pulling an all-nighter or dashing through the bustling downtown to catch a movie with tickets from the university, each experience is unique. Of course, like any place, it also holds its share of difficult memories. The ponds, in particular, serve as a place for both deep contemplation and tearful reflections during moments of existential crisis, something I am quite familiar with. Observing the turtles, ducks, and insects going about their lives, each fulfilling some role, I often pondered my own purpose as I navigated the complexities of life. So, I would walk past the pond, through the park, and beyond the suburban homes until reaching a main street. It was then that the sun's rays illuminated the palm trees and painted the sky, and looking up at the sunrise, I realized I was heading north. There they were, unchanged as ever. The imposing mountains rose above the hazy blue and yellow sky, more prominent than any building on the horizon, and in their silent presence, they reignited my determination.",
            "At first glance, you might overlook it. It's tucked away in a residential area behind a shopping center, not exactly where you'd expect people to live. However, if you venture past the old, deserted Whole Foods and head behind the hotels—mostly empty except for a few summer family reunions—you'll discover a lively community. This neighborhood, nestled on these streets, features several apartment complexes, lined up like Russian nesting dolls carefully arranged in a row. The first set of apartments has garnered some media attention for unsavory issues, so we'll skip over those—appearances can often be misleading. Adjacent to those, and the next two complexes, lies a hidden world unknown to many locals. Opposite these complexes is a satellite campus of a community college, a tranquil collection of buildings where students arrive with coffee in hand, yawning as early as 7 AM to start their day. The gates creak open, letting them in one at a time, while irritated drivers complain about the traffic delays on busy days. The road intersects with another residential street, featuring a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for those recovering from unfortunate injuries. The center has cheerful porch seating and a ceiling fan lazily stirring the warm summer air. Across the street, children play in the park, running across the grass while bees buzz around flower patches. Retirees walk their dogs along the path, scowling at skateboarders and nodding politely to teenage girls chatting by the playground. Nearby, a sushi restaurant in a strip mall offers affordable food yet remains uncrowded, next to a swimming supply store and a nail salon. You could prepare your pool for the season, enjoy a manicure, and savor hibachi chicken all in one stop—the convenience of a strip mall. There's also a DIY frozen yogurt shop, where park-goers often hold chilly cups topped with various treats, performing skateboard tricks and vaping as they see it as trendy. This neighborhood captures a slice of small-town America, a place in the unhurried South where time seems to stand still.",
            "The neighborhood I live in has its own unique charm. Most of the residences are standalone houses, but some have been cleverly divided into two attached units. My house features a modest yard at the front and a small driveway to the left. Like many others here, it harks back to an era when suburban living was synonymous with the American dream. Although this dream seems to be fading, my neighborhood and others like it continue to hold onto its essence, welcoming visitors with a reminder that the dream persists. People here may not feel as hopeful as before, and the gardens are not as meticulously maintained, yet driveways are still occupied by a car or two, and children continue to play as if their surroundings are their entire world. The public school, with its nearly 90-year history, stands as a beacon for the future generation, stirring nostalgia among older residents. While churches are sparsely scattered and often empty, the basketball courts remain lively. Each home has a distinct appearance, but they all share a common feel. There's a large supermarket named Super \"A,\" run by a Yemeni family, likely the only Arab family in the area. The majority of the population is African American. The streets are broad, allowing children to play football, pausing only to let cars pass. Many families have lived here for generations, sharing stories of a time when everyone knew each other. There used to be a karate school, but as interest in karate waned with the decline in related movies, it transformed into a pharmacy, a nod to the belief that medicine solves all, or so the saying goes. A small movie theater screens classic films at a lower price, shunned by the youth for its lack of new releases but cherished by older residents as an affordable night out without the kids. An expressway runs through our town, but the entry and exit ramps are in the neighboring town. A petition for an exit in our town was supported by the younger residents, while the elders opposed it, fearing it would disrupt our community, ultimately convincing the city council to reject the proposal. A new high school is underway, and we're in the process of selecting a mascot. I suggest a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin, as it truly captures the spirit of our town.",
            "Living in a bustling metropolis means my neighborhood is a true melting pot of cultures and lifestyles. The residential zones are interspersed with commercial districts, featuring an array of businesses including offices, shops, eateries, and entertainment venues. There's no end to the new dining spots or shopping experiences, ranging from large, familiar retail chains to charming small boutiques. These smaller stores are increasingly drawing attention, not only in shopping centers but also along the streets, which are conveniently close to otherwise peaceful residential areas. Nearby parks offer a retreat where families often enjoy time with their children. My neighborhood is a tapestry of diversity, showcasing a vibrant mix of communities, such as a notable LGBTQ+ presence, an Orthodox Jewish enclave, and a group of former Soviet Union immigrants and refugees. Venturing slightly beyond, the cultural diversity blossoms further, with distinct areas like Korea Town, China Town, and Little Armenia just a few miles away. However, navigating these distances can be time-consuming due to heavy traffic, especially during peak hours, making a 10-mile journey last up to two hours. Despite the close proximity of various attractions, the city's vastness discourages walking as the main mode of transport, leading to notoriously congested roads and scarce parking. Ironically, the city is seeing a boom in construction, with new apartment complexes rising despite residents' concerns about increasing population density and traffic woes. Housing in the city is varied, with options ranging from large apartment complexes to smaller homes and condos. Some areas feature single-family houses, while others have duplexes, adding to the diversity of living arrangements. My immediate neighborhood reflects this variety, with people of different ages and backgrounds. Despite this, I am not well-acquainted with most of my neighbors, as the community isn't as close-knit as it once was. I fondly recall childhood days playing outdoors with my next-door neighbor and a few friends of similar age, but those interactions seem less common now.",
            "As we cruised by the endless cornfields stretching to the horizon, she asked, \"Where is everything?\" I replied, \"This is it!\" anticipating her surprise at the vast emptiness surrounding us. Coming from a place where the grocery store was just a five-minute stroll away, she had never experienced such expansive open space. The sight of the endless cornfields was a revelation, and I shared with her what life was like growing up in rural Ohio. In that moment, she truly began to understand who I was and the environment that shaped me. Traveling down a narrow country road, we eventually reached a quarry brimming with water. Just beyond this landmark lies the modest neighborhood where I reside. The homes are primarily constructed of brick and stucco, each sitting on at least half an acre, which residents take great pride in maintaining. Springtime brings an abundance of freshly planted flowers alongside the Midwestern trees that transform with the seasons. Driveways gleam with high-end Mercedes Benz cars, polished to shine beneath the midday sun after a thorough wash. As we approached my grey stucco house, my Korean neighbor was outside, always with a welcoming smile. He often spends his days mowing his lawn, his voice harmonizing with the mower's hum. His presence brings joy to the neighborhood; despite aging and losing some sharpness, he remains genuine and intriguing. Previously a doctor, he now seamlessly blends with the grass on his John Deere Zero Turn mower. Finally, we arrived at my home, where geese populate the side yard, playfully pursued by our Terrier. Out back, a small stream flows into the quarry, filling the air with the sounds of bullfrogs, flowing water, and the occasional cow's moo from distant farms. Across a handcrafted wooden bridge lies an untouched sanctuary of wild trees, herbs, and flowers. This is where I spent much of my youth, building tree forts and 'hunting' animals, which mostly involved chasing them, always with a neighborhood friend nearby. Winters in our town can be harsh, yet they bring a unique beauty. The yard shifts from a green sea to a barren wilderness. Trees that once bore vibrant blossoms now stand as stark skeletons. When snow graces us, a magical scene emerges overnight. The backyard becomes a canvas for snow angels made by my little sister and snowmen. Our childhood quarrels were fought with snowballs, constructed in massive igloo-like forts built with branches, ready for battle. In our private winter world, we indulged in make-believe, a time when nothing else mattered. We were simply carefree kids, lost in our own adventures."
