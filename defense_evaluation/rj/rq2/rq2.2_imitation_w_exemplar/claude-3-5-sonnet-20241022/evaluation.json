            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "They call this place Rural America though that aint what it is. Not really. Small town Michigan where the farmland bleeds into tourist towns like blood seeping into cotton. No malls here. No Walmart. No chain restaurants with their neon signs bleeding into the night. Just miles of road stretching between anywhere you need to be.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold something ancient and true. Lake Michigan vast and gray to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, like twin mirrors reflecting whatever truth God left behind. Beaches everywhere you turn, sand and stone waiting for footprints that the water will wash away come morning.\n\nThe neighborhood aint like them suburbs where houses stand shoulder to shoulder like prisoners. These homes got history in their bones. Some fixed up nice, others wearing their age like medals. Most got basements you can see from the street, concrete testimonials to what lies beneath. Aluminum siding gone gray or blue or whatever color folks chose when hope still meant something.\n\nYards spread out like promises. Trampolines standing dark against the sky, swing sets creaking in the wind. Gardens where people still believe things can grow. Fences holding dogs that bark at shadows. These houses speak of work and family and the kind of tired that comes honest.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things, their voices carrying on the wind. Dog walkers and bikers move like ghosts through the evening light. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. Someone's always cooking outside, smoke rising up like prayers. Someone's always waving, smiling, pretending the world aint what it is.\n\nThe lawns stay trim, leaves dont gather. Everything maintained like keeping order might keep chaos at bay. It aint beautiful the way money makes things beautiful, but it's got truth in it. Safety. The kind of place where you can sleep without one eye open.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, and the health department. The recycling center where people bring what's left of things. Baseball fields echo with voices calling names into the darkness. The airport sends its metal birds into the sky, their engines growling like distant thunder. Ice cream shop still standing like it has since before any of us were born. Downtown just a walk away, though walking aint what folks do much anymore.\n\nThe children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through what's left of America. And maybe that's what makes it good. Maybe that's what makes it true. This place. This small piece of what we pretend the world still is.",
            "The houses stood like grave markers in that suburban waste. All of them the same. All of them built to some godless specification laid down by men who'd never set foot on the land. The homeowner's association saw to that. There was grass cut low and stone scattered about and driveways so short a man could cross them in three steps. Small trees dotted the landscape like sentries. Two-car garages lined the streets like empty eye sockets staring into nothing.\n\nThe roads were smooth. Too smooth. No potholes nor cracks marred their perfect surface. As if the earth beneath refused to claim them. Single story dwellings mostly though some rose higher, reaching toward a sky that cared nothing for their aspirations. No mailboxes stood before these houses. Instead they gathered in clusters at the street's end, metal boxes requiring keys, like jail cells for paper and parcels.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the city's edge where civilization met wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land stretched out beyond sight. Swimming pools imprisoned behind iron gates. Walking trails snaked through the emptiness like the tracks of some ancient serpent. You could walk them till your feet bled and never see the same ground twice. \n\nThe old ones lived there mostly. Retirees who'd come to die in peace. Some younger folk too, with their pressed shirts and clean cars. All of them pretending at community, at safety. They watched each other's houses and spoke of brotherhood but they knew nothing of true watching, true brotherhood.\n\nThe city beyond was vast but played at being small. One mall stood like a monument to commerce. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to stores that sold food both costly and cheap. Organic produce displayed like jewels in one place, bare shelves and skeleton crews in another. All of it meaningless. All of it temporary.\n\nThe neighborhood endured. Clean. Safe. Empty of soul. The pools reflected nothing. The trails led nowhere. And the houses stood watching, waiting for something that would never come.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the lost ones, crackling through wire and static like spirits caught between worlds. Strange thing it was. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each turning of the moon and none who lived there knew anything of such tales. Maybe it was the weight of living pressing down. Known folk who'd weep in the nighttime hours when sleep wouldn't come. Everything dear now but we learned to scrape by, year on year.\n\nYou come to know the smell of secondhand things. Smell of dust and age on toys and clothes pulled from darkness. Childhood has its scents but they fade. Some take to tobacco, others just forget what was. But the markets of the poor remain. Adulthood smells of yellowed paper stacked on dead pianos, leather that holds memories even after the washing. Three stores of cast-off things within walking. Starting far out you can trace a path through charity shops, past the library where old books sleep, through curio shops where time stands still.\n\nDowntown's thick with metal and flesh, morning till night, but in those shops silence rules deep as death. Good place to lose yourself when the hours grow long. Each year brings more. Cars and bodies flood the streets like rivers of chrome and bone. Growing city, they say. Some great empire of the digital age making its home here, spreading like a cancer. Makes me think of New York. Everyone chasing their own ghosts, asking nothing of nobody. You can wrap yourself in solitude and none will try to breach it. Not like down South where concern masquerades as kindness. Here you keep your walls high as you please and the city breaks against them like dark water on stone.\n\nLife moves all around. Piano man next door, singers above, their sounds carrying through walls thin as paper. Less strangers now than something like kin. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Found something like fortune here. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean my trace, share what food comes my way, carry their letters like messages between camps. Good to see them, good to be seen. Living in this concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make me think I ain't damned my soul entirely.",
            "The town lay just beyond the reach of the city's sprawl, a small midwestern place where the east side bore the mark of poverty like an old wound. Houses stood weather-beaten and dim, most occupied by those who had little, yet they endured. Not an ugly place. No. The people there would nod and speak when you passed, their faces carrying something of the old world's courtesy despite what time and circumstance had written upon them.\n\nViolence visited sometimes, though not often. In the past years there had been shootings, a killing or two within walking distance. The neighbors boy, shot dead outside a bar not a year past. They heard the shots perhaps, or maybe just the sirens after. Things disappeared from porches in the night. Small things. Left out like offerings to whatever gods still walked these streets.\n\nThe opioid scourge had touched this place same as everywhere. Fentanyl claiming souls like some dark harvester moving through the corn. They had places for the addicted though. Centers where they tried to pull them back from that precipice. People learning to push life back into the dead with Narcan, like some grim resurrection.\n\nThe boy's school stood as a sanctuary. Good people there. Teachers who understood. No child went hungry, all fed same as the next without regard to what their people could pay. The boy, different from the others but loved all the same, found peace there among the chaos of childhood.\n\nThe town council had tried to paint beauty over decay. New roads laid down, parks restored, gardens planted. But their attention turned always to the west side where the money flowed, where commerce still breathed. The east side waited, patient as stone, for care that never came.\n\nSixteen years in this place. The house wasn't much but it held warmth and memories like a vessel. Home was what it was. What it had always been. They couldn't imagine another. Sometimes at night he'd stand on the porch looking out over the neighborhood, watching porch lights wink out one by one, thinking how this place had become the story of their lives, for better or worse, until whatever end waited for them all.",
            "The neighborhood sets upon the hill like some ancient monument to time forgotten. Seven stories up I dwell across from where the theater stands weathered and proud, its marquee dead these many years. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather round arcade machines while neon burns holes in the night. Summer brings them like pilgrims, standing patient in lines that snake down sidewalks worn smooth by countless feet before.\n\nThe park lies north. Concrete walls rise up round it, steps carved like teeth in the gray face of stone. Winter brings the wanderers, their tents clustered close as dying animals seeking warmth against the rain that falls without cease. Not snow here but water eternal, drumming on canvas, seeping into bones. They gather near the shelter where steam rises from showers like spirits fleeing flesh.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks truth here. Not the proud buildings nor the hills that roll like waves toward the distant sea. It's the people carrying memories like scars. Tales of when Hilltop ran red with gang wars, when federal men swept through like dark angels bearing badges and guns. These stories pass like scripture from fathers to sons, mothers to daughters, old residents to new blood like myself.\n\nThey say pale folk shouldn't walk these streets after dark. Words born of old fears, old hatreds deeper than skin. Maybe it's my own darkness that lets me pass, or maybe the Hill knows its own. Knows those who understand the weight of history, the poison of fear and ignorance that runs through this supposed utopia like bile in the veins.\n\nThis is home now. These streets where strangers offer warmth more often than violence. Where washhouse keepers keep doors open against the rain, where concrete storefronts shelter the lost until some passerby stops, extends a hand holding crumpled dollars, speaks words of worth into the void.\n\nThe Hill remembers. The concrete remembers. The people remember. And in their remembering lies truth darker than night and brighter than dawn.",
            "When I first come to this place I was just a boy. Eighth grade. The houses stood like silent sentinels in the fading light of summer, two stories tall and identical save for the paint and trim that marked each dwelling from its neighbor. Two houses down lived a boy who'd become something like a brother to me. Another lived further up the street. Both gone now but the memories remain like photographs bleached by the sun, preserved in amber.\n\nThe same folk who dwelled here then dwell here still. A suburban tract no different from ten thousand others scattered across this vast land. The sounds of children at play echo through the streets when the weather turns warm, their laughter carrying on the wind like birdsong. Quiet most days. The kind of quiet that settles deep in your bones. Never had no trouble with the neighbors. They mind their business less you need help, and packages left on porches stay where they're meant to. Trust runs deep here like an underground stream.\n\nThere's a park nearby. Not more than a minute's walk. Played ball there countless times. Basketball. Football. Baseball. Got my nose broke there once playing football but that's just one dark thread in a tapestry of brighter moments. These days I take my cousin's young ones there. They're small yet, still finding joy in swings and slides, their eyes lighting up at the mere mention of the place. Makes something stir in my chest when I go there now. Memory perhaps. Or maybe just the ghost of what used to be.\n\nThe neighborhood's a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth within walking distance. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All of it there for the taking though most folks these days just tap their phones and wait for dinner to arrive at their door like magic. Fast food joints too, same as anywhere else, and pizza places scattered like seeds in the wind.\n\nGot everything a body might need. Dry cleaners. Drug stores standing across from each other like duelists at dawn. A Jewel-Osco where the midwest folk get their groceries. Even got an Indian store where you can find spices that smell like distant lands.\n\nReading about other neighborhoods, hearing tales of strife and discord, makes me grateful for this place. This quiet corner of the world where people still look out for one another. Where trust ain't just a word but something real you can hold onto like a rope in the dark.",
            "The neighborhood lay close to the college where I studied, a place of concrete and brick rising from cracked earth. Apartment buildings stood like ancient monoliths, their faces weathered and gray. Between them bars and eating houses squatted low against the ground, their neon signs humming in the night like tired insects. They'd renamed one of the bars not long past. More costly now but the liquor still poured.\n\nThe people here existed in two tribes. Students with their bright faces and clean clothes, and the others, the ones who lived in the cheaper units where the rent didnt break them. Children too, many of them, drawn to the elementary school that rose up from behind chain link and dead grass.\n\nMy neighbors I knew only by the sweet smoke that crept beneath their door. Management had mounted some mechanical thing that spat perfume into the hall. A joke really. But there wasnt much funny about this place. Old buildings with fresh paint inside trying to hide what they truly were. Down the way they'd built new ones, cheap things made of particle board and promises, charging gold prices for tin accommodations. But they could. They knew they could.\n\nA restaurant sat five minutes walking distance, serving microwaved dreams on paper plates. Across from it a gas station where souls went to die working minimum wage. The city had come through with money, laid new concrete for walking, planted grass in strips between the road. Made it look civilized. But our building stood back in the trees, some cut down to stumps like broken teeth in a dead man's mouth. Behind us forty-third street ran parallel, a meaner place where sidewalks broke apart like dried mud and buildings crouched behind their screens of leaves. Crime lived there. Though it lived everywhere really, even in the complex across from us where people came and went like shadows in the night.\n\nBut it was home. Affordable. Close enough to walk to class. Two bus stops that could carry you to market or downtown. A place to exist while the world turned its slow circle toward whatever end awaited us all.",
            "The duplexes stood in their yellow paint and white porches like sentinels in the dying light, green metal roofs catching what remained of the sun. A cul-de-sac where folk gathered in the gloaming, standing in driveways not chosen but found, speaking low while children drew their chalk figures on the concrete and sent their kites up into the darkening sky. Like some memory of a time before the world grew cold with its machines and screens casting their blue light on empty faces.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up against a sky that carried clouds white as bone. But the weather turned mean as it does in these parts. Sirens wailed their warning into the night and folk scattered to their shelters like leaves before a storm. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and what possessions seemed to matter, while the big one paced and barked at something it couldn't name. The hail came then, beating against the earth like God's own dice. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing its last, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five like a stone dropped in deep water. The hail melted where it touched the blacktop and then the sun broke through and the rain came again and with it two rainbows arced across the sky like some covenant made new.\n\nThe streets lay quiet for a time, then life crept back. Women and children emerged like creatures from their burrows, the smell of cooking riding the evening air. All of it strange to me, come down from the north where folk speak different. Each house the same outside but different within, some small as coffins though you wouldn't know it. Behind my place lies a field and beyond that a pond where no one swims. Deer move through the morning mist and bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters call across the dawn and in the evening a donkey brays his lonesome song. Like some forgotten corner of the world where time moves slower and folk still know their neighbors. Found this place like finding an old coin in the dirt, something precious that someone lost or left behind.",
            "Ten years gone now in this place. Time stretches like a dark road with no end. Memory carries me back to that first day when we crossed over from Riverdale to Stockbridge, tears marking their path down my young face like rain on a windowpane. Mama and daddy, they had their reasons. Better schools they said. Better houses. A place where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nThe years rolled past like dead leaves in autumn wind. Made friends. Made enemies too. Most neighbors stayed strangers except for Mr. Glen and Dennis, living in their houses next to ours like sentinels in the night. Mr. Glen's wedding stays with me still. His new bride Ms. Veda in white, pure as driven snow. When she threw that little white strap from her leg it found its way to my hands like it was meant to be there. We danced that night, me and Marsharii, his daughter. Never saw her after. The world takes what it wants.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a maze of concrete and asphalt. GPS helps now but back then it was wild territory. Me and Kason and Curtis, we'd venture out like explorers in some ancient land, controllers in hand instead of compasses, marking time with pixels and sound.\n\nThe park became my sanctuary. Nature speaking in tongues only the soul can understand. I'd bring my wooden sword and balance sticks from the hardware store, practicing forms like some warrior monk in exile. Tennis courts and basketball hoops stand sentinel, unused now but waiting. Daddy and Mr. Graves, they taught us tennis in those days. Worked us till our muscles screamed but we smiled through it all.\n\nMemory is a cruel thing. It keeps what it wants and discards the rest like ashes in the wind. But these memories, they stay. They root deep like old trees. And somewhere out there in the darkness ahead, more memories wait to be made. God willing, if he's still watching.",
            "Johnston lay quiet in the South Carolina heat, a town no different from any other save for the peach trees that gave it its name. The Peach Capital of the World the sign said and the words stood there faded and proud against the merciless sun. Fields stretched out beyond sight, dotted with peach orchards or cattle standing black against the sky like ancient cave paintings come to life.\n\nThe houses set back from the road, metal roofs gleaming like shields or gray shingles dulled by time and weather. They stood apart from one another as if in mutual wariness, fields between them given over to beast or crop or sometimes nothing at all. In town a single stoplight swung above the crossroads, marking the heart of what commerce existed here.\n\nThree places to eat. The Hong Kong where a single family worked in silence. The Fiesta where Mexican music played soft and tired. Gary's with its burgers wrapped in wax paper gone translucent with grease. The pizzeria long gone now, its windows blank as dead eyes.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug still stood, known more for its cherry cola than any medicine it might dispense. The IGA grocery sat expensive and lonesome, folk choosing instead to make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General thrived like a weed in poor soil, its fluorescent lights drawing people like moths until closing time.\n\nThe furniture store called Possibilities had stood so long nobody remembered when it wasnt there, run by a woman whose kindness seemed a relic of some other time. Next door the pet groomers cleaned and cut and kept the animals of those who could afford such things. A doctor and a vet practiced their arts in separate buildings away from town, tending to what ills flesh might manifest.\n\nThe elementary school stood silent in summer, its children gone to middle and high school in the next town over like young birds pushed from the nest. They spoke of building a park, two and a half acres of manufactured joy, but for now the land lay empty as it had since time out of mind.\n\nNo theater here. No bowling alley. No place for youth to gather and dream of escape. Just the road through town, so quick a traveler might pass through between blinks and never know they'd been anywhere at all.",
            "The road cuts between two highways like a vein between arteries, the traffic moving past our house in perpetual motion, a reminder of the world beyond. We inhabit this corner where the street bends, watching the parade of metal and rubber that marks the passage of days. The neighbors we know by their vehicles, their faces, their routines. Strange cars draw our eyes like carrion birds to fresh kill.\n\nThe neighborhood stands as it has, houses rooted deep in what was once woodland. Trees tower above, their shadows pooling dark across yards where children pedal their bicycles in endless circles. Four souls dwell in our house - myself, the woman who shares my bed, and two girls, one eleven winters, the other fourteen. We remain close to home, our work tethered to these walls.\n\nThe seasons mark themselves in sounds. Lawnmowers drone from spring through fall, their mechanical growl echoing across fenced yards like some primitive ritual. When autumn comes the leaves descend, golden and rust-colored harbingers of winter. We burn them in piles, the smoke carrying memories of childhood into the gray sky. Winter has grown weak here, more ghost than season, leaving autumn to stretch like a dying man across the calendar.\n\nOur garage stands sentinel at the back of the house, the front door forgotten save for rare visitors who announce themselves with knuckles against wood. With the garage doors yawning open, I work on my truck, feeling the pulse of the neighborhood through the concrete floor. Metal against metal, tools speaking their own language.\n\nHolidays bring strange cars and foreign faces, relatives flooding the streets like water seeking low ground. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Mother's Day - the rhythm of family gathering and dispersing again, like waves against a shore. The neighborhood breathes these changes in and out.\n\nThis street serves as corridor between larger roads, and there lies its single flaw. But we abide here still, watching the world pass by our corner, marking time by the shadows of trees and the sound of children at play. It is not perfect, but it is ours.",
            "The land stretches brown and endless, dirt piled upon dirt like some ancient god's discarded earthworks. Unless you walked these grounds yourself you dont know what it means to see nothing but brown spreading out before you like a dead sea, and when you spy a patch of green lawn somewhere you know that man has paid dearly for his small victory over the desert. Time was in the nineties when houses stood far apart like sentinels in the waste but now they cluster closer though the spaces between still yawn wide and empty. The city grows like a cancer. Most places do.\n\nGood folk and bad folk both walk these streets same as anywhere. Round my place its mostly old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind screen doors. The stores aint much to speak of, just them chain outfits, Food For Less and such. Anything fancy means driving and driving far. No Whole Foods here. Construction work feeds most families, hammers ringing out across empty lots waiting to be filled. Sometimes that sound keeps me awake thinking about how the open spaces are dying. I ran from the big city once. Dont aim to live in another.\n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and ceiling work, following the build like them others. But its the animals make this place home. Folk come here for different reasons but mostly its the stark beauty does it, the way the desert just lies there naked under the sky. Different creatures live here, things that learned to survive in the heat and dust. People ought to learn about them, learn to live alongside them proper. My young ones, they took to it natural. Three of them out there now hunting lizards and beetles in the dust like little savages.\n\nThe county fair comes through sometimes. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like old men's beards and folk go up there to slide down them on boards. Down in the museum they keep bits of old bones and Indian things behind glass, telling stories about how this place came to be what it is. But mostly its just the desert and us, living in it day by day, watching the brown earth stretch away toward mountains that stand like ancient teeth against the sky.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some concrete vision of hell. Gray buildings rising up from the ashen earth, their windows dead and lightless in the morning sun. He thinks on how this place aint like other neighborhoods folk might speak of. No white picket fences here. No children's bicycles left carelessly in driveways. This here's different. This here's where he dwells.\n\nThe dormitory stands like a concrete monolith against the pale sky. Inside its bowels students sleep and wake and dream their dreams. Two to a cell mostly, packed in tight like prisoners serving time. The apartments aint much different. Twenty souls or thereabouts to each building, stacked two floors high like some architectural mockery of hope.\n\nThen there's the houses. Real houses. Alumni dwelling places scattered bout like bones bleached white in the sun. Two bedrooms. Sometimes four. Not many though. Efficiency aint in their nature and the powers that be know it well enough.\n\nThe people here. Lord the people here. They come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds moving through the concrete maze like blood through veins. Professional types in their pressed shirts occupying the houses while the young ones, green as spring corn, crowd the dormitories. The older students take to the apartments like refugees seeking higher ground.\n\nStores dot the landscape like pustules on diseased skin. Food places mostly. Clothing shops bearing the school's mark like brands on cattle. A grocery too. Everything a body might need within these borders, he reckons. And the park. One single park standing defiant against the spread of concrete and steel. Clean they keep it. Safe too. Though he wonders sometimes if anything in this world can truly be called safe anymore.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood. But it's his. And in the end that's all that matters in this godless place they call education.",
            "There aint no sidewalks here. Everything runs down like water finding its way to the sea and our house sits atop the highest ridge where the wind comes cold and constant. They call it the workout hill on account of the runners who come daily to test themselves against its grade. Folk walk in the road because there aint nowhere else to walk. The blacktop's scarred and pocked like an old man's face, treacherous to them that dont know its ways. Above hang the wires, twisted and spliced and mended a hundred times over from storms that come without warning or mercy. The trees stand tall and dark, evergreens stretching toward a gray heaven, but the people here hate them for blocking their view of the water and cut them down whenever they can. Houses rise up like glass-faced sentinels, each trying to peer over the shoulder of the one before it to catch a glimpse of the bay below.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns like molten copper but most days the clouds hang low and heavy, wrapping everything in a perpetual twilight. The moss claims whatever stands still long enough, painting the world in shades of green. Left my truck idle for a month once and found it transformed into something ancient and primordial, took hours to reclaim it from the green.\n\nAint many children here though theres a school close by. Old folk mostly, retired and waiting. Dogs run free instead of children, appearing like ghosts in yards and doorways. Found one in my living room once, standing there like it owned the place. Rabbits too, big as cats some of them, digging up gardens til my cats got to hunting them down. Birds wheel overhead - tiny ones that flit between branches and great raptors that the crows drive off like army squadrons protecting their territory.\n\nNo stores nearby but down by the water where the land gives way to stone there's places that serve up what the bay provides. The beach aint much but the rocks make good missiles to hurl into the gray waters. The opposite shore stands clear most days through the mist like some promised land we cant quite reach.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some great beast sprawled across Brooklyn, its concrete arteries pulsing with the blood of subway trains running deep beneath the earth. The streets stretched out before you like the fingers of a dead man's hand, each one lined with two-story houses standing shoulder to shoulder in their eternal vigil.\n\nThe Asians had come. Twenty years past they'd settled here and made it their own. Their stores rose up from the sidewalks like mushrooms after rain, signs in languages that looked like broken birds scattered across storefronts. Markets and laundries mostly. Four such markets within sight of each other, their produce spilling out onto the concrete in wooden crates. Good food and cheap too. The kind of places where old women would barter in tongues unknown.\n\nThe park stood renovated and raw. Basketball courts stretched out like graves, ten of them, and beyond that the soccer field lay green and vast. Children played there in the summer heat, their dark faces glistening under the spray of water fountains. All colors of mankind gathered there, their children mingling like drops of paint in a vast palette.\n\nNo towers here. No glass and steel monuments to greed. Just the low buildings squatting in their own shadows. Co-ops and condos rose up here and there but mostly it was the two-family houses, packed tight like books on a shelf. The streets never slept. Music blasted from passing cars like the war cries of mechanical beasts, engines roaring in the night like demons unleashed from some automotive hell.\n\nNight brought its own terrors. The darkness held teeth and claws, thieves and bullies prowling like coyotes. He remembered the beating he'd taken years ago, remembered the taste of blood and concrete. These days the thieves took packages instead of blood, but the darkness remained unchanged.\n\nDog shit everywhere. Like some biblical plague visited upon the sidewalks. No matter the fines, no matter the laws, it lay there in wait every morning. A reminder perhaps that even in this concrete wilderness, nature would have its say. The city had tried to tame it with ordinances and threats but still it remained, testament to man's eternal struggle against the base and primal things that lurked at the edges of civilization.",
            "You got to understand what weird means in Portland Oregon. Aint no simple thing. Up on that old building where they serve pizza and liquor and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws quiet-like, the words stand stark against the gray sky: Keep Portland Weird. Some folk remember it different, back before the money came, when weird meant something pure and raw in the rain-soaked streets. Others hear it like a calling, come here where your strangeness aint no burden to bear.\n\nThe Californians keep coming. Building their glass towers reaching up into the perpetual clouds like fingers of some desperate god. But the weird persists. Not the kind that welcomes all, mind you, but the kind that takes in what others cast out. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in every store, same fights, same troubles. Got our share of normal too - them yoga folk and hipsters in their tight pants and the business types with their clean shoes. Maybe we just dont hold so tight to the pretending.\n\nWhere I stay at, houses painted like fever dreams. Gardens growing wild right up through the concrete, herbs and flowers fighting for space with the vegetables. Come summer the free boxes appear like mushrooms after rain. Cardboard prophecies filled with castoff dreams. Books and clothes mostly, but sometimes treasures that seem placed there by some knowing hand, waiting for the right soul to pass by.\n\nThe rain it comes and stays. Dark clouds hanging low enough to touch, bringing with them the shadows in mens minds. Got them that chase dragons in the streets, them that sleep under bridges cause theres nowhere else to go. Services better than most places but still aint enough. Never is. The people who got homes, they swing between mercy and hate like a broken compass seeking true north.\n\nThe soccer crowds fill the streets some days. Other folk bend themselves into shapes while goats walk on their backs. Each to their own peculiar worship. Some chase dreams, others drown them in beer glasses. All of us weird in our own way, or maybe none of us weird at all. Just people trying to make sense of the world in this corner of it, where the rain falls more days than not and the weird aint so much a choice as it is the air we breathe.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. North they rise like ancient gods bearing witness to the coming and going of light. A man might forget them in the blur of days and toil but they remain, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of men. And when the weight of living bears down heavy they command attention and in their presence a soul might find rest, might draw strength enough to weather one more dawn, one more dusk. \n\nI came here young, barely more than a boy, drawn to those northern peaks that loomed above the campus grounds. The university itself held beauty in its way, old buildings and still ponds and trees that had seen a hundred summers come and go, but the mountains ruled over all like silent kings. The town spread below them like a supplicant, all brick and mortar weathered by time. Coffee houses where students hunched over books in the small hours, their faces pale in the fluorescent light. The downtown streets where old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their facades speaking of times long past when men believed in permanence. There the city showed its teeth, its vigor, but it didnt last. Beyond the library the quiet returned like a tide.\n\nThe city was two things at once, busy and still, loud and quiet. A man could lose himself in its streets and find himself again. Memory clung to every corner like cobwebs. Good memories of walking past rusted playground swings with friends when the night was old, of running through crowded streets to catch pictures at the theater. But darker memories too, the kind that haunt a man in the small hours. Id stood by those ponds watching turtles and waterfowl going about their business while I searched for meaning in my own existence. Id shed tears there at two in the morning when the weight of living grew too heavy.\n\nOne morning I walked past the pond, past the park with its neat houses standing in rows like headstones. I walked until I reached the main road. The sun was coming up, painting the sky in fire, setting the palm fronds ablaze with light. I looked north. There they stood as they had always stood, those mountains older than memory, their peaks cutting into the dawn sky like knives. They spoke without speaking, and in their presence I found the will to endure.",
            "You wouldnt see it first off. Just houses behind some stores. Not the kind of place folk'd choose to dwell in. But go on past that dead Whole Foods building, past them hotels that only fill when summer brings the families back like migrating birds, and there's life there. Real life. Streets lined with apartment buildings stood up like old dominos waiting to fall, all in a row neat as you please. First ones got trouble in em. Been in the papers. We wont speak on that. But them others next door and the ones after, they're different somehow. Like stepping into another world entirely.\n\nCross the way there's this college. Small thing. Just some buildings keeping watch over the road where sleepy students drift in with their coffee cups at dawn. Iron gates scream on their hinges letting em through while folks in cars curse the delay, their fists raised up like flags of surrender to the morning.\n\nRoad ends at another, T-shaped like a gallows. Park on one side. Other side's got this place where broken people go to mend. Got chairs out front where nobody sits and a fan that just pushes the thick air around and around like God stirring soup.\n\nChildren spin in the grass like fallen leaves. Bees drift drunk between flowers. Old folk walk their dogs, eyeing the skateboard kids like they was carrying plague, nodding to girls bunched up by the swings talking about whatever girls talk about these days.\n\nStrip mall's got this sushi place. Empty mostly. Swimming store next door. Nail place between. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish. There's this yogurt shop too where kids go to feel grown, sucking sugar through plastic straws and blowing vapor in the air like they was dragons in a fairy tale.\n\nWhole place is like some picture of America that got stuck in time. South moving slow as molasses, holding onto what it knows, refusing to let go. Time dont mean much here. Never did.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels of some forgotten age. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins in their death throes. Small patches of yard lay before each dwelling and strips of concrete they called driveways stretched alongside like pale fingers reaching for something long gone. These were the remnants of that old dream. The American dream they'd called it. It had wrapped itself round the throat of a nation and now was slowly loosening its grip leaving only these neighborhoods behind. Testament to what was. What might have been.\n\nThe yards aint kept like they once were and the people's eyes dont shine with that old light but still the machines rest in the driveways like sleeping beasts and still the young ones play in the street like there aint nothing else in all the world that matters. The schoolhouse stands yet. Ninety years of brick and mortar promising futures it maybe cant deliver no more while stirring up ghosts in them that's old enough to remember. Churches scattered and empty but the basketball courts full of life like blood pooling in the wounds of a dying thing.\n\nHouses different as brothers but carrying the same blood. That market run by them Yemen folk, probably the only Arab blood for miles in this sea of black faces. Streets wide as rivers where children play their games, pausing only when the cars come through like metal leviathans. Most folks been here since there was a here to be in. They'll tell you tales of when everybody knew everybody else's name and business too.\n\nWhere the karate school once stood now there's a pharmacy. Seems fitting somehow. Dreams of being the karate kid replaced by little white pills that make the dreams go away altogether. The picture show still runs, showing yesterday's stories at yesterday's prices. The young ones dont go there no more but the old folks, they remember.\n\nThat expressway cuts through like a concrete snake but it dont stop here. They tried once to make it stop. Young blood wanted it, old blood didn't. Old blood won out like it usually does in matters such as these. They're raising up a new school now and talking about what creature should stand for what they are. But how do you capture what cant be captured? How do you draw the shape of a dying dream?",
            "The city sprawls vast and restless, a thing alive and breathing with its own dark pulse. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a perpetual haze of exhaust and industry, their windows dead and lightless in the afternoon glare. Streets wind through the maze of steel and glass, some broad as rivers, others narrow as cattle chutes, all of them gorged with vehicles moving slow as blood through dying veins.\n\nThe people here exist in their separate tribes though sometimes they intersect like old migratory paths crossing in the waste. Orthodox Jews in their black hats and coats move like shadows through the streets while nearby rainbow flags hang limp and faded above doorways where the queer folk gather. Further out lie the ethnic boroughs - Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia - each one a world contained within itself, each speaking in tongues foreign to the others.\n\nHe remembered playing in these streets as a child, back when neighbors still knew one another's names and children ran wild in the gathering dusk. But those days were long dead now. The city had swallowed such things. Now apartment towers rose like concrete mushrooms after rain, their residents stacked in steel boxes reaching toward a sky they'd never touch. Traffic choked the arteries of the city day and night. Ten miles might take two hours to traverse, the vehicles crawling bumper to bumper like a funeral procession with no end and no beginning.\n\nConstruction cranes turned slow circles overhead, building more towers, more boxes to house the endless waves of newcomers drawn to this place like moths to flame. The old residents watched with dead eyes as their city transformed, as parking spaces became scarce as water in the desert, as the streets grew more crowded with each passing season.\n\nHouses still stood in places, holdouts from an older time. Single family homes and duplexes hunched between the towers like dying breeds facing extinction. But they too would fall in time. The city was hungry and patient. It would consume everything in the end. That's what cities do. They feed and grow and change until nothing remains of what once was. Until even memory fades like old photographs left too long in the sun.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn, the fields stretching out into nothing. This is it, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The corn went on and on like some biblical plague, row after row until the horizon swallowed them whole. I told her bout growing up here in this emptiness, this Ohio nowhere, and something in her eyes changed like she finally understood the making of me.\n\nPast the waterlogged quarry you come to where the houses stand. Brick and stucco dwellings each with its plot of ground that folk tend like their own small kingdoms. Come spring the flowers rise up out of the earth and the trees shed their winter bones for new flesh. Mercedes automobiles gleam in driveways like chrome beacons, proud testimonies to prosperity in this heartland waste.\n\nThe Korean lives next door, ancient now but still singing while he rides his mower in endless circles. Once was a doctor they say though now he's just the old man who tends the grass, moving slow like some ritual dance between the property lines. Time has taken pieces of his mind but left his gentle nature intact.\n\nOur house stands gray against the sky. Geese patrol the yard while the terrier gives chase, both caught in some eternal game neither can win. The stream out back feeds the quarry, carrying with it the sounds of frogs and distant cattle lowing in the dark. Cross the wooden bridge we built with our hands and you'll find what's left of the wild world. Trees stand sentinel over herbs and flowers that grew according to no man's plan. Here's where childhood lived, where we built our wooden fortresses in the trees and played at being hunters though we never killed nothing worth killing.\n\nWinter comes harsh as judgment to this land. The yard that was green turns to emptiness, trees stripped to bone and sinew against the gray sky. Snow comes like a blessing some nights, turning all to white silence. My sister would leave her angels pressed in the snow while we waged our wars with frozen ammunition, building walls of ice and stick like we could hold back time itself. We were gods then in our small kingdom, when nothing mattered but the game and the next handful of snow and the sound of our own laughter echoing across the frozen waste."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "They call this place Rural America though that aint what it is. Not really. Small town Michigan where the farmland bleeds into tourist towns like blood seeping into cotton. No malls here. No Walmart. No chain restaurants with their neon signs bleeding into the night. Just miles of road stretching between anywhere you need to be.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold something ancient and true. Lake Michigan vast and gray to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, like twin mirrors reflecting whatever truth God left behind. Beaches everywhere you turn, sand and stone waiting for footprints that the water will wash away come morning.\n\nThe neighborhood aint like them suburbs where houses stand shoulder to shoulder like prisoners. These homes got history in their bones. Some fixed up nice, others wearing their age like medals. Most got basements you can see from the street, concrete testimonials to what lies beneath. Aluminum siding gone gray or blue or whatever color folks chose when hope still meant something.\n\nYards spread out like promises. Trampolines standing dark against the sky, swing sets creaking in the wind. Gardens where people still believe things can grow. Fences holding dogs that bark at shadows. These houses speak of work and family and the kind of tired that comes honest.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things, their voices carrying on the wind. Dog walkers and bikers move like ghosts through the evening light. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. Someone's always cooking outside, smoke rising up like prayers. Someone's always waving, smiling, pretending the world aint what it is.\n\nThe lawns stay trim, leaves dont gather. Everything maintained like keeping order might keep chaos at bay. It aint beautiful the way money makes things beautiful, but it's got truth in it. Safety. The kind of place where you can sleep without one eye open.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, and the health department. The recycling center where people bring what's left of things. Baseball fields echo with voices calling names into the darkness. The airport sends its metal birds into the sky, their engines growling like distant thunder. Ice cream shop still standing like it has since before any of us were born. Downtown just a walk away, though walking aint what folks do much anymore.\n\nThe children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through what's left of America. And maybe that's what makes it good. Maybe that's what makes it true. This place. This small piece of what we pretend the world still is.",
            "The houses stood like grave markers in that suburban waste. All of them the same. All of them built to some godless specification laid down by men who'd never set foot on the land. The homeowner's association saw to that. There was grass cut low and stone scattered about and driveways so short a man could cross them in three steps. Small trees dotted the landscape like sentries. Two-car garages lined the streets like empty eye sockets staring into nothing.\n\nThe roads were smooth. Too smooth. No potholes nor cracks marred their perfect surface. As if the earth beneath refused to claim them. Single story dwellings mostly though some rose higher, reaching toward a sky that cared nothing for their aspirations. No mailboxes stood before these houses. Instead they gathered in clusters at the street's end, metal boxes requiring keys, like jail cells for paper and parcels.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the city's edge where civilization met wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land stretched out beyond sight. Swimming pools imprisoned behind iron gates. Walking trails snaked through the emptiness like the tracks of some ancient serpent. You could walk them till your feet bled and never see the same ground twice. \n\nThe old ones lived there mostly. Retirees who'd come to die in peace. Some younger folk too, with their pressed shirts and clean cars. All of them pretending at community, at safety. They watched each other's houses and spoke of brotherhood but they knew nothing of true watching, true brotherhood.\n\nThe city beyond was vast but played at being small. One mall stood like a monument to commerce. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to stores that sold food both costly and cheap. Organic produce displayed like jewels in one place, bare shelves and skeleton crews in another. All of it meaningless. All of it temporary.\n\nThe neighborhood endured. Clean. Safe. Empty of soul. The pools reflected nothing. The trails led nowhere. And the houses stood watching, waiting for something that would never come.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the lost ones, crackling through wire and static like spirits caught between worlds. Strange thing it was. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each turning of the moon and none who lived there knew anything of such tales. Maybe it was the weight of living pressing down. Known folk who'd weep in the nighttime hours when sleep wouldn't come. Everything dear now but we learned to scrape by, year on year.\n\nYou come to know the smell of secondhand things. Smell of dust and age on toys and clothes pulled from darkness. Childhood has its scents but they fade. Some take to tobacco, others just forget what was. But the markets of the poor remain. Adulthood smells of yellowed paper stacked on dead pianos, leather that holds memories even after the washing. Three stores of cast-off things within walking. Starting far out you can trace a path through charity shops, past the library where old books sleep, through curio shops where time stands still.\n\nDowntown's thick with metal and flesh, morning till night, but in those shops silence rules deep as death. Good place to lose yourself when the hours grow long. Each year brings more. Cars and bodies flood the streets like rivers of chrome and bone. Growing city, they say. Some great empire of the digital age making its home here, spreading like a cancer. Makes me think of New York. Everyone chasing their own ghosts, asking nothing of nobody. You can wrap yourself in solitude and none will try to breach it. Not like down South where concern masquerades as kindness. Here you keep your walls high as you please and the city breaks against them like dark water on stone.\n\nLife moves all around. Piano man next door, singers above, their sounds carrying through walls thin as paper. Less strangers now than something like kin. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Found something like fortune here. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean my trace, share what food comes my way, carry their letters like messages between camps. Good to see them, good to be seen. Living in this concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make me think I ain't damned my soul entirely.",
            "The town lay just beyond the reach of the city's sprawl, a small midwestern place where the east side bore the mark of poverty like an old wound. Houses stood weather-beaten and dim, most occupied by those who had little, yet they endured. Not an ugly place. No. The people there would nod and speak when you passed, their faces carrying something of the old world's courtesy despite what time and circumstance had written upon them.\n\nViolence visited sometimes, though not often. In the past years there had been shootings, a killing or two within walking distance. The neighbors boy, shot dead outside a bar not a year past. They heard the shots perhaps, or maybe just the sirens after. Things disappeared from porches in the night. Small things. Left out like offerings to whatever gods still walked these streets.\n\nThe opioid scourge had touched this place same as everywhere. Fentanyl claiming souls like some dark harvester moving through the corn. They had places for the addicted though. Centers where they tried to pull them back from that precipice. People learning to push life back into the dead with Narcan, like some grim resurrection.\n\nThe boy's school stood as a sanctuary. Good people there. Teachers who understood. No child went hungry, all fed same as the next without regard to what their people could pay. The boy, different from the others but loved all the same, found peace there among the chaos of childhood.\n\nThe town council had tried to paint beauty over decay. New roads laid down, parks restored, gardens planted. But their attention turned always to the west side where the money flowed, where commerce still breathed. The east side waited, patient as stone, for care that never came.\n\nSixteen years in this place. The house wasn't much but it held warmth and memories like a vessel. Home was what it was. What it had always been. They couldn't imagine another. Sometimes at night he'd stand on the porch looking out over the neighborhood, watching porch lights wink out one by one, thinking how this place had become the story of their lives, for better or worse, until whatever end waited for them all.",
            "The neighborhood sets upon the hill like some ancient monument to time forgotten. Seven stories up I dwell across from where the theater stands weathered and proud, its marquee dead these many years. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather round arcade machines while neon burns holes in the night. Summer brings them like pilgrims, standing patient in lines that snake down sidewalks worn smooth by countless feet before.\n\nThe park lies north. Concrete walls rise up round it, steps carved like teeth in the gray face of stone. Winter brings the wanderers, their tents clustered close as dying animals seeking warmth against the rain that falls without cease. Not snow here but water eternal, drumming on canvas, seeping into bones. They gather near the shelter where steam rises from showers like spirits fleeing flesh.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks truth here. Not the proud buildings nor the hills that roll like waves toward the distant sea. It's the people carrying memories like scars. Tales of when Hilltop ran red with gang wars, when federal men swept through like dark angels bearing badges and guns. These stories pass like scripture from fathers to sons, mothers to daughters, old residents to new blood like myself.\n\nThey say pale folk shouldn't walk these streets after dark. Words born of old fears, old hatreds deeper than skin. Maybe it's my own darkness that lets me pass, or maybe the Hill knows its own. Knows those who understand the weight of history, the poison of fear and ignorance that runs through this supposed utopia like bile in the veins.\n\nThis is home now. These streets where strangers offer warmth more often than violence. Where washhouse keepers keep doors open against the rain, where concrete storefronts shelter the lost until some passerby stops, extends a hand holding crumpled dollars, speaks words of worth into the void.\n\nThe Hill remembers. The concrete remembers. The people remember. And in their remembering lies truth darker than night and brighter than dawn.",
            "When I first come to this place I was just a boy. Eighth grade. The houses stood like silent sentinels in the fading light of summer, two stories tall and identical save for the paint and trim that marked each dwelling from its neighbor. Two houses down lived a boy who'd become something like a brother to me. Another lived further up the street. Both gone now but the memories remain like photographs bleached by the sun, preserved in amber.\n\nThe same folk who dwelled here then dwell here still. A suburban tract no different from ten thousand others scattered across this vast land. The sounds of children at play echo through the streets when the weather turns warm, their laughter carrying on the wind like birdsong. Quiet most days. The kind of quiet that settles deep in your bones. Never had no trouble with the neighbors. They mind their business less you need help, and packages left on porches stay where they're meant to. Trust runs deep here like an underground stream.\n\nThere's a park nearby. Not more than a minute's walk. Played ball there countless times. Basketball. Football. Baseball. Got my nose broke there once playing football but that's just one dark thread in a tapestry of brighter moments. These days I take my cousin's young ones there. They're small yet, still finding joy in swings and slides, their eyes lighting up at the mere mention of the place. Makes something stir in my chest when I go there now. Memory perhaps. Or maybe just the ghost of what used to be.\n\nThe neighborhood's a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth within walking distance. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All of it there for the taking though most folks these days just tap their phones and wait for dinner to arrive at their door like magic. Fast food joints too, same as anywhere else, and pizza places scattered like seeds in the wind.\n\nGot everything a body might need. Dry cleaners. Drug stores standing across from each other like duelists at dawn. A Jewel-Osco where the midwest folk get their groceries. Even got an Indian store where you can find spices that smell like distant lands.\n\nReading about other neighborhoods, hearing tales of strife and discord, makes me grateful for this place. This quiet corner of the world where people still look out for one another. Where trust ain't just a word but something real you can hold onto like a rope in the dark.",
            "The neighborhood lay close to the college where I studied, a place of concrete and brick rising from cracked earth. Apartment buildings stood like ancient monoliths, their faces weathered and gray. Between them bars and eating houses squatted low against the ground, their neon signs humming in the night like tired insects. They'd renamed one of the bars not long past. More costly now but the liquor still poured.\n\nThe people here existed in two tribes. Students with their bright faces and clean clothes, and the others, the ones who lived in the cheaper units where the rent didnt break them. Children too, many of them, drawn to the elementary school that rose up from behind chain link and dead grass.\n\nMy neighbors I knew only by the sweet smoke that crept beneath their door. Management had mounted some mechanical thing that spat perfume into the hall. A joke really. But there wasnt much funny about this place. Old buildings with fresh paint inside trying to hide what they truly were. Down the way they'd built new ones, cheap things made of particle board and promises, charging gold prices for tin accommodations. But they could. They knew they could.\n\nA restaurant sat five minutes walking distance, serving microwaved dreams on paper plates. Across from it a gas station where souls went to die working minimum wage. The city had come through with money, laid new concrete for walking, planted grass in strips between the road. Made it look civilized. But our building stood back in the trees, some cut down to stumps like broken teeth in a dead man's mouth. Behind us forty-third street ran parallel, a meaner place where sidewalks broke apart like dried mud and buildings crouched behind their screens of leaves. Crime lived there. Though it lived everywhere really, even in the complex across from us where people came and went like shadows in the night.\n\nBut it was home. Affordable. Close enough to walk to class. Two bus stops that could carry you to market or downtown. A place to exist while the world turned its slow circle toward whatever end awaited us all.",
            "The duplexes stood in their yellow paint and white porches like sentinels in the dying light, green metal roofs catching what remained of the sun. A cul-de-sac where folk gathered in the gloaming, standing in driveways not chosen but found, speaking low while children drew their chalk figures on the concrete and sent their kites up into the darkening sky. Like some memory of a time before the world grew cold with its machines and screens casting their blue light on empty faces.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up against a sky that carried clouds white as bone. But the weather turned mean as it does in these parts. Sirens wailed their warning into the night and folk scattered to their shelters like leaves before a storm. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and what possessions seemed to matter, while the big one paced and barked at something it couldn't name. The hail came then, beating against the earth like God's own dice. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing its last, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five like a stone dropped in deep water. The hail melted where it touched the blacktop and then the sun broke through and the rain came again and with it two rainbows arced across the sky like some covenant made new.\n\nThe streets lay quiet for a time, then life crept back. Women and children emerged like creatures from their burrows, the smell of cooking riding the evening air. All of it strange to me, come down from the north where folk speak different. Each house the same outside but different within, some small as coffins though you wouldn't know it. Behind my place lies a field and beyond that a pond where no one swims. Deer move through the morning mist and bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters call across the dawn and in the evening a donkey brays his lonesome song. Like some forgotten corner of the world where time moves slower and folk still know their neighbors. Found this place like finding an old coin in the dirt, something precious that someone lost or left behind.",
            "Ten years gone now in this place. Time stretches like a dark road with no end. Memory carries me back to that first day when we crossed over from Riverdale to Stockbridge, tears marking their path down my young face like rain on a windowpane. Mama and daddy, they had their reasons. Better schools they said. Better houses. A place where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nThe years rolled past like dead leaves in autumn wind. Made friends. Made enemies too. Most neighbors stayed strangers except for Mr. Glen and Dennis, living in their houses next to ours like sentinels in the night. Mr. Glen's wedding stays with me still. His new bride Ms. Veda in white, pure as driven snow. When she threw that little white strap from her leg it found its way to my hands like it was meant to be there. We danced that night, me and Marsharii, his daughter. Never saw her after. The world takes what it wants.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a maze of concrete and asphalt. GPS helps now but back then it was wild territory. Me and Kason and Curtis, we'd venture out like explorers in some ancient land, controllers in hand instead of compasses, marking time with pixels and sound.\n\nThe park became my sanctuary. Nature speaking in tongues only the soul can understand. I'd bring my wooden sword and balance sticks from the hardware store, practicing forms like some warrior monk in exile. Tennis courts and basketball hoops stand sentinel, unused now but waiting. Daddy and Mr. Graves, they taught us tennis in those days. Worked us till our muscles screamed but we smiled through it all.\n\nMemory is a cruel thing. It keeps what it wants and discards the rest like ashes in the wind. But these memories, they stay. They root deep like old trees. And somewhere out there in the darkness ahead, more memories wait to be made. God willing, if he's still watching.",
            "Johnston lay quiet in the South Carolina heat, a town no different from any other save for the peach trees that gave it its name. The Peach Capital of the World the sign said and the words stood there faded and proud against the merciless sun. Fields stretched out beyond sight, dotted with peach orchards or cattle standing black against the sky like ancient cave paintings come to life.\n\nThe houses set back from the road, metal roofs gleaming like shields or gray shingles dulled by time and weather. They stood apart from one another as if in mutual wariness, fields between them given over to beast or crop or sometimes nothing at all. In town a single stoplight swung above the crossroads, marking the heart of what commerce existed here.\n\nThree places to eat. The Hong Kong where a single family worked in silence. The Fiesta where Mexican music played soft and tired. Gary's with its burgers wrapped in wax paper gone translucent with grease. The pizzeria long gone now, its windows blank as dead eyes.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug still stood, known more for its cherry cola than any medicine it might dispense. The IGA grocery sat expensive and lonesome, folk choosing instead to make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General thrived like a weed in poor soil, its fluorescent lights drawing people like moths until closing time.\n\nThe furniture store called Possibilities had stood so long nobody remembered when it wasnt there, run by a woman whose kindness seemed a relic of some other time. Next door the pet groomers cleaned and cut and kept the animals of those who could afford such things. A doctor and a vet practiced their arts in separate buildings away from town, tending to what ills flesh might manifest.\n\nThe elementary school stood silent in summer, its children gone to middle and high school in the next town over like young birds pushed from the nest. They spoke of building a park, two and a half acres of manufactured joy, but for now the land lay empty as it had since time out of mind.\n\nNo theater here. No bowling alley. No place for youth to gather and dream of escape. Just the road through town, so quick a traveler might pass through between blinks and never know they'd been anywhere at all.",
            "The road cuts between two highways like a vein between arteries, the traffic moving past our house in perpetual motion, a reminder of the world beyond. We inhabit this corner where the street bends, watching the parade of metal and rubber that marks the passage of days. The neighbors we know by their vehicles, their faces, their routines. Strange cars draw our eyes like carrion birds to fresh kill.\n\nThe neighborhood stands as it has, houses rooted deep in what was once woodland. Trees tower above, their shadows pooling dark across yards where children pedal their bicycles in endless circles. Four souls dwell in our house - myself, the woman who shares my bed, and two girls, one eleven winters, the other fourteen. We remain close to home, our work tethered to these walls.\n\nThe seasons mark themselves in sounds. Lawnmowers drone from spring through fall, their mechanical growl echoing across fenced yards like some primitive ritual. When autumn comes the leaves descend, golden and rust-colored harbingers of winter. We burn them in piles, the smoke carrying memories of childhood into the gray sky. Winter has grown weak here, more ghost than season, leaving autumn to stretch like a dying man across the calendar.\n\nOur garage stands sentinel at the back of the house, the front door forgotten save for rare visitors who announce themselves with knuckles against wood. With the garage doors yawning open, I work on my truck, feeling the pulse of the neighborhood through the concrete floor. Metal against metal, tools speaking their own language.\n\nHolidays bring strange cars and foreign faces, relatives flooding the streets like water seeking low ground. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Mother's Day - the rhythm of family gathering and dispersing again, like waves against a shore. The neighborhood breathes these changes in and out.\n\nThis street serves as corridor between larger roads, and there lies its single flaw. But we abide here still, watching the world pass by our corner, marking time by the shadows of trees and the sound of children at play. It is not perfect, but it is ours.",
            "The land stretches brown and endless, dirt piled upon dirt like some ancient god's discarded earthworks. Unless you walked these grounds yourself you dont know what it means to see nothing but brown spreading out before you like a dead sea, and when you spy a patch of green lawn somewhere you know that man has paid dearly for his small victory over the desert. Time was in the nineties when houses stood far apart like sentinels in the waste but now they cluster closer though the spaces between still yawn wide and empty. The city grows like a cancer. Most places do.\n\nGood folk and bad folk both walk these streets same as anywhere. Round my place its mostly old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind screen doors. The stores aint much to speak of, just them chain outfits, Food For Less and such. Anything fancy means driving and driving far. No Whole Foods here. Construction work feeds most families, hammers ringing out across empty lots waiting to be filled. Sometimes that sound keeps me awake thinking about how the open spaces are dying. I ran from the big city once. Dont aim to live in another.\n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and ceiling work, following the build like them others. But its the animals make this place home. Folk come here for different reasons but mostly its the stark beauty does it, the way the desert just lies there naked under the sky. Different creatures live here, things that learned to survive in the heat and dust. People ought to learn about them, learn to live alongside them proper. My young ones, they took to it natural. Three of them out there now hunting lizards and beetles in the dust like little savages.\n\nThe county fair comes through sometimes. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like old men's beards and folk go up there to slide down them on boards. Down in the museum they keep bits of old bones and Indian things behind glass, telling stories about how this place came to be what it is. But mostly its just the desert and us, living in it day by day, watching the brown earth stretch away toward mountains that stand like ancient teeth against the sky.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some concrete vision of hell. Gray buildings rising up from the ashen earth, their windows dead and lightless in the morning sun. He thinks on how this place aint like other neighborhoods folk might speak of. No white picket fences here. No children's bicycles left carelessly in driveways. This here's different. This here's where he dwells.\n\nThe dormitory stands like a concrete monolith against the pale sky. Inside its bowels students sleep and wake and dream their dreams. Two to a cell mostly, packed in tight like prisoners serving time. The apartments aint much different. Twenty souls or thereabouts to each building, stacked two floors high like some architectural mockery of hope.\n\nThen there's the houses. Real houses. Alumni dwelling places scattered bout like bones bleached white in the sun. Two bedrooms. Sometimes four. Not many though. Efficiency aint in their nature and the powers that be know it well enough.\n\nThe people here. Lord the people here. They come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds moving through the concrete maze like blood through veins. Professional types in their pressed shirts occupying the houses while the young ones, green as spring corn, crowd the dormitories. The older students take to the apartments like refugees seeking higher ground.\n\nStores dot the landscape like pustules on diseased skin. Food places mostly. Clothing shops bearing the school's mark like brands on cattle. A grocery too. Everything a body might need within these borders, he reckons. And the park. One single park standing defiant against the spread of concrete and steel. Clean they keep it. Safe too. Though he wonders sometimes if anything in this world can truly be called safe anymore.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood. But it's his. And in the end that's all that matters in this godless place they call education.",
            "There aint no sidewalks here. Everything runs down like water finding its way to the sea and our house sits atop the highest ridge where the wind comes cold and constant. They call it the workout hill on account of the runners who come daily to test themselves against its grade. Folk walk in the road because there aint nowhere else to walk. The blacktop's scarred and pocked like an old man's face, treacherous to them that dont know its ways. Above hang the wires, twisted and spliced and mended a hundred times over from storms that come without warning or mercy. The trees stand tall and dark, evergreens stretching toward a gray heaven, but the people here hate them for blocking their view of the water and cut them down whenever they can. Houses rise up like glass-faced sentinels, each trying to peer over the shoulder of the one before it to catch a glimpse of the bay below.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns like molten copper but most days the clouds hang low and heavy, wrapping everything in a perpetual twilight. The moss claims whatever stands still long enough, painting the world in shades of green. Left my truck idle for a month once and found it transformed into something ancient and primordial, took hours to reclaim it from the green.\n\nAint many children here though theres a school close by. Old folk mostly, retired and waiting. Dogs run free instead of children, appearing like ghosts in yards and doorways. Found one in my living room once, standing there like it owned the place. Rabbits too, big as cats some of them, digging up gardens til my cats got to hunting them down. Birds wheel overhead - tiny ones that flit between branches and great raptors that the crows drive off like army squadrons protecting their territory.\n\nNo stores nearby but down by the water where the land gives way to stone there's places that serve up what the bay provides. The beach aint much but the rocks make good missiles to hurl into the gray waters. The opposite shore stands clear most days through the mist like some promised land we cant quite reach.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some great beast sprawled across Brooklyn, its concrete arteries pulsing with the blood of subway trains running deep beneath the earth. The streets stretched out before you like the fingers of a dead man's hand, each one lined with two-story houses standing shoulder to shoulder in their eternal vigil.\n\nThe Asians had come. Twenty years past they'd settled here and made it their own. Their stores rose up from the sidewalks like mushrooms after rain, signs in languages that looked like broken birds scattered across storefronts. Markets and laundries mostly. Four such markets within sight of each other, their produce spilling out onto the concrete in wooden crates. Good food and cheap too. The kind of places where old women would barter in tongues unknown.\n\nThe park stood renovated and raw. Basketball courts stretched out like graves, ten of them, and beyond that the soccer field lay green and vast. Children played there in the summer heat, their dark faces glistening under the spray of water fountains. All colors of mankind gathered there, their children mingling like drops of paint in a vast palette.\n\nNo towers here. No glass and steel monuments to greed. Just the low buildings squatting in their own shadows. Co-ops and condos rose up here and there but mostly it was the two-family houses, packed tight like books on a shelf. The streets never slept. Music blasted from passing cars like the war cries of mechanical beasts, engines roaring in the night like demons unleashed from some automotive hell.\n\nNight brought its own terrors. The darkness held teeth and claws, thieves and bullies prowling like coyotes. He remembered the beating he'd taken years ago, remembered the taste of blood and concrete. These days the thieves took packages instead of blood, but the darkness remained unchanged.\n\nDog shit everywhere. Like some biblical plague visited upon the sidewalks. No matter the fines, no matter the laws, it lay there in wait every morning. A reminder perhaps that even in this concrete wilderness, nature would have its say. The city had tried to tame it with ordinances and threats but still it remained, testament to man's eternal struggle against the base and primal things that lurked at the edges of civilization.",
            "You got to understand what weird means in Portland Oregon. Aint no simple thing. Up on that old building where they serve pizza and liquor and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws quiet-like, the words stand stark against the gray sky: Keep Portland Weird. Some folk remember it different, back before the money came, when weird meant something pure and raw in the rain-soaked streets. Others hear it like a calling, come here where your strangeness aint no burden to bear.\n\nThe Californians keep coming. Building their glass towers reaching up into the perpetual clouds like fingers of some desperate god. But the weird persists. Not the kind that welcomes all, mind you, but the kind that takes in what others cast out. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in every store, same fights, same troubles. Got our share of normal too - them yoga folk and hipsters in their tight pants and the business types with their clean shoes. Maybe we just dont hold so tight to the pretending.\n\nWhere I stay at, houses painted like fever dreams. Gardens growing wild right up through the concrete, herbs and flowers fighting for space with the vegetables. Come summer the free boxes appear like mushrooms after rain. Cardboard prophecies filled with castoff dreams. Books and clothes mostly, but sometimes treasures that seem placed there by some knowing hand, waiting for the right soul to pass by.\n\nThe rain it comes and stays. Dark clouds hanging low enough to touch, bringing with them the shadows in mens minds. Got them that chase dragons in the streets, them that sleep under bridges cause theres nowhere else to go. Services better than most places but still aint enough. Never is. The people who got homes, they swing between mercy and hate like a broken compass seeking true north.\n\nThe soccer crowds fill the streets some days. Other folk bend themselves into shapes while goats walk on their backs. Each to their own peculiar worship. Some chase dreams, others drown them in beer glasses. All of us weird in our own way, or maybe none of us weird at all. Just people trying to make sense of the world in this corner of it, where the rain falls more days than not and the weird aint so much a choice as it is the air we breathe.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. North they rise like ancient gods bearing witness to the coming and going of light. A man might forget them in the blur of days and toil but they remain, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of men. And when the weight of living bears down heavy they command attention and in their presence a soul might find rest, might draw strength enough to weather one more dawn, one more dusk. \n\nI came here young, barely more than a boy, drawn to those northern peaks that loomed above the campus grounds. The university itself held beauty in its way, old buildings and still ponds and trees that had seen a hundred summers come and go, but the mountains ruled over all like silent kings. The town spread below them like a supplicant, all brick and mortar weathered by time. Coffee houses where students hunched over books in the small hours, their faces pale in the fluorescent light. The downtown streets where old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their facades speaking of times long past when men believed in permanence. There the city showed its teeth, its vigor, but it didnt last. Beyond the library the quiet returned like a tide.\n\nThe city was two things at once, busy and still, loud and quiet. A man could lose himself in its streets and find himself again. Memory clung to every corner like cobwebs. Good memories of walking past rusted playground swings with friends when the night was old, of running through crowded streets to catch pictures at the theater. But darker memories too, the kind that haunt a man in the small hours. Id stood by those ponds watching turtles and waterfowl going about their business while I searched for meaning in my own existence. Id shed tears there at two in the morning when the weight of living grew too heavy.\n\nOne morning I walked past the pond, past the park with its neat houses standing in rows like headstones. I walked until I reached the main road. The sun was coming up, painting the sky in fire, setting the palm fronds ablaze with light. I looked north. There they stood as they had always stood, those mountains older than memory, their peaks cutting into the dawn sky like knives. They spoke without speaking, and in their presence I found the will to endure.",
            "You wouldnt see it first off. Just houses behind some stores. Not the kind of place folk'd choose to dwell in. But go on past that dead Whole Foods building, past them hotels that only fill when summer brings the families back like migrating birds, and there's life there. Real life. Streets lined with apartment buildings stood up like old dominos waiting to fall, all in a row neat as you please. First ones got trouble in em. Been in the papers. We wont speak on that. But them others next door and the ones after, they're different somehow. Like stepping into another world entirely.\n\nCross the way there's this college. Small thing. Just some buildings keeping watch over the road where sleepy students drift in with their coffee cups at dawn. Iron gates scream on their hinges letting em through while folks in cars curse the delay, their fists raised up like flags of surrender to the morning.\n\nRoad ends at another, T-shaped like a gallows. Park on one side. Other side's got this place where broken people go to mend. Got chairs out front where nobody sits and a fan that just pushes the thick air around and around like God stirring soup.\n\nChildren spin in the grass like fallen leaves. Bees drift drunk between flowers. Old folk walk their dogs, eyeing the skateboard kids like they was carrying plague, nodding to girls bunched up by the swings talking about whatever girls talk about these days.\n\nStrip mall's got this sushi place. Empty mostly. Swimming store next door. Nail place between. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish. There's this yogurt shop too where kids go to feel grown, sucking sugar through plastic straws and blowing vapor in the air like they was dragons in a fairy tale.\n\nWhole place is like some picture of America that got stuck in time. South moving slow as molasses, holding onto what it knows, refusing to let go. Time dont mean much here. Never did.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels of some forgotten age. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins in their death throes. Small patches of yard lay before each dwelling and strips of concrete they called driveways stretched alongside like pale fingers reaching for something long gone. These were the remnants of that old dream. The American dream they'd called it. It had wrapped itself round the throat of a nation and now was slowly loosening its grip leaving only these neighborhoods behind. Testament to what was. What might have been.\n\nThe yards aint kept like they once were and the people's eyes dont shine with that old light but still the machines rest in the driveways like sleeping beasts and still the young ones play in the street like there aint nothing else in all the world that matters. The schoolhouse stands yet. Ninety years of brick and mortar promising futures it maybe cant deliver no more while stirring up ghosts in them that's old enough to remember. Churches scattered and empty but the basketball courts full of life like blood pooling in the wounds of a dying thing.\n\nHouses different as brothers but carrying the same blood. That market run by them Yemen folk, probably the only Arab blood for miles in this sea of black faces. Streets wide as rivers where children play their games, pausing only when the cars come through like metal leviathans. Most folks been here since there was a here to be in. They'll tell you tales of when everybody knew everybody else's name and business too.\n\nWhere the karate school once stood now there's a pharmacy. Seems fitting somehow. Dreams of being the karate kid replaced by little white pills that make the dreams go away altogether. The picture show still runs, showing yesterday's stories at yesterday's prices. The young ones dont go there no more but the old folks, they remember.\n\nThat expressway cuts through like a concrete snake but it dont stop here. They tried once to make it stop. Young blood wanted it, old blood didn't. Old blood won out like it usually does in matters such as these. They're raising up a new school now and talking about what creature should stand for what they are. But how do you capture what cant be captured? How do you draw the shape of a dying dream?",
            "The city sprawls vast and restless, a thing alive and breathing with its own dark pulse. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a perpetual haze of exhaust and industry, their windows dead and lightless in the afternoon glare. Streets wind through the maze of steel and glass, some broad as rivers, others narrow as cattle chutes, all of them gorged with vehicles moving slow as blood through dying veins.\n\nThe people here exist in their separate tribes though sometimes they intersect like old migratory paths crossing in the waste. Orthodox Jews in their black hats and coats move like shadows through the streets while nearby rainbow flags hang limp and faded above doorways where the queer folk gather. Further out lie the ethnic boroughs - Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia - each one a world contained within itself, each speaking in tongues foreign to the others.\n\nHe remembered playing in these streets as a child, back when neighbors still knew one another's names and children ran wild in the gathering dusk. But those days were long dead now. The city had swallowed such things. Now apartment towers rose like concrete mushrooms after rain, their residents stacked in steel boxes reaching toward a sky they'd never touch. Traffic choked the arteries of the city day and night. Ten miles might take two hours to traverse, the vehicles crawling bumper to bumper like a funeral procession with no end and no beginning.\n\nConstruction cranes turned slow circles overhead, building more towers, more boxes to house the endless waves of newcomers drawn to this place like moths to flame. The old residents watched with dead eyes as their city transformed, as parking spaces became scarce as water in the desert, as the streets grew more crowded with each passing season.\n\nHouses still stood in places, holdouts from an older time. Single family homes and duplexes hunched between the towers like dying breeds facing extinction. But they too would fall in time. The city was hungry and patient. It would consume everything in the end. That's what cities do. They feed and grow and change until nothing remains of what once was. Until even memory fades like old photographs left too long in the sun.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn, the fields stretching out into nothing. This is it, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The corn went on and on like some biblical plague, row after row until the horizon swallowed them whole. I told her bout growing up here in this emptiness, this Ohio nowhere, and something in her eyes changed like she finally understood the making of me.\n\nPast the waterlogged quarry you come to where the houses stand. Brick and stucco dwellings each with its plot of ground that folk tend like their own small kingdoms. Come spring the flowers rise up out of the earth and the trees shed their winter bones for new flesh. Mercedes automobiles gleam in driveways like chrome beacons, proud testimonies to prosperity in this heartland waste.\n\nThe Korean lives next door, ancient now but still singing while he rides his mower in endless circles. Once was a doctor they say though now he's just the old man who tends the grass, moving slow like some ritual dance between the property lines. Time has taken pieces of his mind but left his gentle nature intact.\n\nOur house stands gray against the sky. Geese patrol the yard while the terrier gives chase, both caught in some eternal game neither can win. The stream out back feeds the quarry, carrying with it the sounds of frogs and distant cattle lowing in the dark. Cross the wooden bridge we built with our hands and you'll find what's left of the wild world. Trees stand sentinel over herbs and flowers that grew according to no man's plan. Here's where childhood lived, where we built our wooden fortresses in the trees and played at being hunters though we never killed nothing worth killing.\n\nWinter comes harsh as judgment to this land. The yard that was green turns to emptiness, trees stripped to bone and sinew against the gray sky. Snow comes like a blessing some nights, turning all to white silence. My sister would leave her angels pressed in the snow while we waged our wars with frozen ammunition, building walls of ice and stick like we could hold back time itself. We were gods then in our small kingdom, when nothing mattered but the game and the next handful of snow and the sound of our own laughter echoing across the frozen waste."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "They call this place Rural America though that aint what it is. Not really. Small town Michigan where the farmland bleeds into tourist towns like blood seeping into cotton. No malls here. No Walmart. No chain restaurants with their neon signs bleeding into the night. Just miles of road stretching between anywhere you need to be.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold something ancient and true. Lake Michigan vast and gray to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, like twin mirrors reflecting whatever truth God left behind. Beaches everywhere you turn, sand and stone waiting for footprints that the water will wash away come morning.\n\nThe neighborhood aint like them suburbs where houses stand shoulder to shoulder like prisoners. These homes got history in their bones. Some fixed up nice, others wearing their age like medals. Most got basements you can see from the street, concrete testimonials to what lies beneath. Aluminum siding gone gray or blue or whatever color folks chose when hope still meant something.\n\nYards spread out like promises. Trampolines standing dark against the sky, swing sets creaking in the wind. Gardens where people still believe things can grow. Fences holding dogs that bark at shadows. These houses speak of work and family and the kind of tired that comes honest.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things, their voices carrying on the wind. Dog walkers and bikers move like ghosts through the evening light. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. Someone's always cooking outside, smoke rising up like prayers. Someone's always waving, smiling, pretending the world aint what it is.\n\nThe lawns stay trim, leaves dont gather. Everything maintained like keeping order might keep chaos at bay. It aint beautiful the way money makes things beautiful, but it's got truth in it. Safety. The kind of place where you can sleep without one eye open.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, and the health department. The recycling center where people bring what's left of things. Baseball fields echo with voices calling names into the darkness. The airport sends its metal birds into the sky, their engines growling like distant thunder. Ice cream shop still standing like it has since before any of us were born. Downtown just a walk away, though walking aint what folks do much anymore.\n\nThe children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through what's left of America. And maybe that's what makes it good. Maybe that's what makes it true. This place. This small piece of what we pretend the world still is.",
            "The houses stood like grave markers in that suburban waste. All of them the same. All of them built to some godless specification laid down by men who'd never set foot on the land. The homeowner's association saw to that. There was grass cut low and stone scattered about and driveways so short a man could cross them in three steps. Small trees dotted the landscape like sentries. Two-car garages lined the streets like empty eye sockets staring into nothing.\n\nThe roads were smooth. Too smooth. No potholes nor cracks marred their perfect surface. As if the earth beneath refused to claim them. Single story dwellings mostly though some rose higher, reaching toward a sky that cared nothing for their aspirations. No mailboxes stood before these houses. Instead they gathered in clusters at the street's end, metal boxes requiring keys, like jail cells for paper and parcels.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the city's edge where civilization met wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land stretched out beyond sight. Swimming pools imprisoned behind iron gates. Walking trails snaked through the emptiness like the tracks of some ancient serpent. You could walk them till your feet bled and never see the same ground twice. \n\nThe old ones lived there mostly. Retirees who'd come to die in peace. Some younger folk too, with their pressed shirts and clean cars. All of them pretending at community, at safety. They watched each other's houses and spoke of brotherhood but they knew nothing of true watching, true brotherhood.\n\nThe city beyond was vast but played at being small. One mall stood like a monument to commerce. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to stores that sold food both costly and cheap. Organic produce displayed like jewels in one place, bare shelves and skeleton crews in another. All of it meaningless. All of it temporary.\n\nThe neighborhood endured. Clean. Safe. Empty of soul. The pools reflected nothing. The trails led nowhere. And the houses stood watching, waiting for something that would never come.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the lost ones, crackling through wire and static like spirits caught between worlds. Strange thing it was. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each turning of the moon and none who lived there knew anything of such tales. Maybe it was the weight of living pressing down. Known folk who'd weep in the nighttime hours when sleep wouldn't come. Everything dear now but we learned to scrape by, year on year.\n\nYou come to know the smell of secondhand things. Smell of dust and age on toys and clothes pulled from darkness. Childhood has its scents but they fade. Some take to tobacco, others just forget what was. But the markets of the poor remain. Adulthood smells of yellowed paper stacked on dead pianos, leather that holds memories even after the washing. Three stores of cast-off things within walking. Starting far out you can trace a path through charity shops, past the library where old books sleep, through curio shops where time stands still.\n\nDowntown's thick with metal and flesh, morning till night, but in those shops silence rules deep as death. Good place to lose yourself when the hours grow long. Each year brings more. Cars and bodies flood the streets like rivers of chrome and bone. Growing city, they say. Some great empire of the digital age making its home here, spreading like a cancer. Makes me think of New York. Everyone chasing their own ghosts, asking nothing of nobody. You can wrap yourself in solitude and none will try to breach it. Not like down South where concern masquerades as kindness. Here you keep your walls high as you please and the city breaks against them like dark water on stone.\n\nLife moves all around. Piano man next door, singers above, their sounds carrying through walls thin as paper. Less strangers now than something like kin. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Found something like fortune here. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean my trace, share what food comes my way, carry their letters like messages between camps. Good to see them, good to be seen. Living in this concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make me think I ain't damned my soul entirely.",
            "The town lay just beyond the reach of the city's sprawl, a small midwestern place where the east side bore the mark of poverty like an old wound. Houses stood weather-beaten and dim, most occupied by those who had little, yet they endured. Not an ugly place. No. The people there would nod and speak when you passed, their faces carrying something of the old world's courtesy despite what time and circumstance had written upon them.\n\nViolence visited sometimes, though not often. In the past years there had been shootings, a killing or two within walking distance. The neighbors boy, shot dead outside a bar not a year past. They heard the shots perhaps, or maybe just the sirens after. Things disappeared from porches in the night. Small things. Left out like offerings to whatever gods still walked these streets.\n\nThe opioid scourge had touched this place same as everywhere. Fentanyl claiming souls like some dark harvester moving through the corn. They had places for the addicted though. Centers where they tried to pull them back from that precipice. People learning to push life back into the dead with Narcan, like some grim resurrection.\n\nThe boy's school stood as a sanctuary. Good people there. Teachers who understood. No child went hungry, all fed same as the next without regard to what their people could pay. The boy, different from the others but loved all the same, found peace there among the chaos of childhood.\n\nThe town council had tried to paint beauty over decay. New roads laid down, parks restored, gardens planted. But their attention turned always to the west side where the money flowed, where commerce still breathed. The east side waited, patient as stone, for care that never came.\n\nSixteen years in this place. The house wasn't much but it held warmth and memories like a vessel. Home was what it was. What it had always been. They couldn't imagine another. Sometimes at night he'd stand on the porch looking out over the neighborhood, watching porch lights wink out one by one, thinking how this place had become the story of their lives, for better or worse, until whatever end waited for them all.",
            "The neighborhood sets upon the hill like some ancient monument to time forgotten. Seven stories up I dwell across from where the theater stands weathered and proud, its marquee dead these many years. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather round arcade machines while neon burns holes in the night. Summer brings them like pilgrims, standing patient in lines that snake down sidewalks worn smooth by countless feet before.\n\nThe park lies north. Concrete walls rise up round it, steps carved like teeth in the gray face of stone. Winter brings the wanderers, their tents clustered close as dying animals seeking warmth against the rain that falls without cease. Not snow here but water eternal, drumming on canvas, seeping into bones. They gather near the shelter where steam rises from showers like spirits fleeing flesh.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks truth here. Not the proud buildings nor the hills that roll like waves toward the distant sea. It's the people carrying memories like scars. Tales of when Hilltop ran red with gang wars, when federal men swept through like dark angels bearing badges and guns. These stories pass like scripture from fathers to sons, mothers to daughters, old residents to new blood like myself.\n\nThey say pale folk shouldn't walk these streets after dark. Words born of old fears, old hatreds deeper than skin. Maybe it's my own darkness that lets me pass, or maybe the Hill knows its own. Knows those who understand the weight of history, the poison of fear and ignorance that runs through this supposed utopia like bile in the veins.\n\nThis is home now. These streets where strangers offer warmth more often than violence. Where washhouse keepers keep doors open against the rain, where concrete storefronts shelter the lost until some passerby stops, extends a hand holding crumpled dollars, speaks words of worth into the void.\n\nThe Hill remembers. The concrete remembers. The people remember. And in their remembering lies truth darker than night and brighter than dawn.",
            "When I first come to this place I was just a boy. Eighth grade. The houses stood like silent sentinels in the fading light of summer, two stories tall and identical save for the paint and trim that marked each dwelling from its neighbor. Two houses down lived a boy who'd become something like a brother to me. Another lived further up the street. Both gone now but the memories remain like photographs bleached by the sun, preserved in amber.\n\nThe same folk who dwelled here then dwell here still. A suburban tract no different from ten thousand others scattered across this vast land. The sounds of children at play echo through the streets when the weather turns warm, their laughter carrying on the wind like birdsong. Quiet most days. The kind of quiet that settles deep in your bones. Never had no trouble with the neighbors. They mind their business less you need help, and packages left on porches stay where they're meant to. Trust runs deep here like an underground stream.\n\nThere's a park nearby. Not more than a minute's walk. Played ball there countless times. Basketball. Football. Baseball. Got my nose broke there once playing football but that's just one dark thread in a tapestry of brighter moments. These days I take my cousin's young ones there. They're small yet, still finding joy in swings and slides, their eyes lighting up at the mere mention of the place. Makes something stir in my chest when I go there now. Memory perhaps. Or maybe just the ghost of what used to be.\n\nThe neighborhood's a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth within walking distance. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All of it there for the taking though most folks these days just tap their phones and wait for dinner to arrive at their door like magic. Fast food joints too, same as anywhere else, and pizza places scattered like seeds in the wind.\n\nGot everything a body might need. Dry cleaners. Drug stores standing across from each other like duelists at dawn. A Jewel-Osco where the midwest folk get their groceries. Even got an Indian store where you can find spices that smell like distant lands.\n\nReading about other neighborhoods, hearing tales of strife and discord, makes me grateful for this place. This quiet corner of the world where people still look out for one another. Where trust ain't just a word but something real you can hold onto like a rope in the dark.",
            "The neighborhood lay close to the college where I studied, a place of concrete and brick rising from cracked earth. Apartment buildings stood like ancient monoliths, their faces weathered and gray. Between them bars and eating houses squatted low against the ground, their neon signs humming in the night like tired insects. They'd renamed one of the bars not long past. More costly now but the liquor still poured.\n\nThe people here existed in two tribes. Students with their bright faces and clean clothes, and the others, the ones who lived in the cheaper units where the rent didnt break them. Children too, many of them, drawn to the elementary school that rose up from behind chain link and dead grass.\n\nMy neighbors I knew only by the sweet smoke that crept beneath their door. Management had mounted some mechanical thing that spat perfume into the hall. A joke really. But there wasnt much funny about this place. Old buildings with fresh paint inside trying to hide what they truly were. Down the way they'd built new ones, cheap things made of particle board and promises, charging gold prices for tin accommodations. But they could. They knew they could.\n\nA restaurant sat five minutes walking distance, serving microwaved dreams on paper plates. Across from it a gas station where souls went to die working minimum wage. The city had come through with money, laid new concrete for walking, planted grass in strips between the road. Made it look civilized. But our building stood back in the trees, some cut down to stumps like broken teeth in a dead man's mouth. Behind us forty-third street ran parallel, a meaner place where sidewalks broke apart like dried mud and buildings crouched behind their screens of leaves. Crime lived there. Though it lived everywhere really, even in the complex across from us where people came and went like shadows in the night.\n\nBut it was home. Affordable. Close enough to walk to class. Two bus stops that could carry you to market or downtown. A place to exist while the world turned its slow circle toward whatever end awaited us all.",
            "The duplexes stood in their yellow paint and white porches like sentinels in the dying light, green metal roofs catching what remained of the sun. A cul-de-sac where folk gathered in the gloaming, standing in driveways not chosen but found, speaking low while children drew their chalk figures on the concrete and sent their kites up into the darkening sky. Like some memory of a time before the world grew cold with its machines and screens casting their blue light on empty faces.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up against a sky that carried clouds white as bone. But the weather turned mean as it does in these parts. Sirens wailed their warning into the night and folk scattered to their shelters like leaves before a storm. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and what possessions seemed to matter, while the big one paced and barked at something it couldn't name. The hail came then, beating against the earth like God's own dice. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing its last, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five like a stone dropped in deep water. The hail melted where it touched the blacktop and then the sun broke through and the rain came again and with it two rainbows arced across the sky like some covenant made new.\n\nThe streets lay quiet for a time, then life crept back. Women and children emerged like creatures from their burrows, the smell of cooking riding the evening air. All of it strange to me, come down from the north where folk speak different. Each house the same outside but different within, some small as coffins though you wouldn't know it. Behind my place lies a field and beyond that a pond where no one swims. Deer move through the morning mist and bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters call across the dawn and in the evening a donkey brays his lonesome song. Like some forgotten corner of the world where time moves slower and folk still know their neighbors. Found this place like finding an old coin in the dirt, something precious that someone lost or left behind.",

Memory carries me back to that first day when we crossed over from Riverdale to Stockbridge, tears marking their path down my young face like rain on a windowpane. Mama and daddy, they had their reasons. Better schools they said. Better houses. A place where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nThe years rolled past like dead leaves in autumn wind. Made friends. Made enemies too. Most neighbors stayed strangers except for Mr. Glen and Dennis, living in their houses next to ours like sentinels in the night. Mr. Glen's wedding stays with me still. His new bride Ms. Veda in white, pure as driven snow. When she threw that little white strap from her leg it found its way to my hands like it was meant to be there. We danced that night, me and Marsharii, his daughter. Never saw her after. The world takes what it wants.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a maze of concrete and asphalt. GPS helps now but back then it was wild territory. Me and Kason and Curtis, we'd venture out like explorers in some ancient land, controllers in hand instead of compasses, marking time with pixels and sound.\n\nThe park became my sanctuary. Nature speaking in tongues only the soul can understand. I'd bring my wooden sword and balance sticks from the hardware store, practicing forms like some warrior monk in exile. Tennis courts and basketball hoops stand sentinel, unused now but waiting. Daddy and Mr. Graves, they taught us tennis in those days. Worked us till our muscles screamed but we smiled through it all.\n\nMemory is a cruel thing. It keeps what it wants and discards the rest like ashes in the wind. But these memories, they stay. They root deep like old trees. And somewhere out there in the darkness ahead, more memories wait to be made. God willing, if he's still watching.",
            "Johnston lay quiet in the South Carolina heat, a town no different from any other save for the peach trees that gave it its name. The Peach Capital of the World the sign said and the words stood there faded and proud against the merciless sun. Fields stretched out beyond sight, dotted with peach orchards or cattle standing black against the sky like ancient cave paintings come to life.\n\nThe houses set back from the road, metal roofs gleaming like shields or gray shingles dulled by time and weather. They stood apart from one another as if in mutual wariness, fields between them given over to beast or crop or sometimes nothing at all. In town a single stoplight swung above the crossroads, marking the heart of what commerce existed here.\n\nThree places to eat. The Hong Kong where a single family worked in silence. The Fiesta where Mexican music played soft and tired. Gary's with its burgers wrapped in wax paper gone translucent with grease. The pizzeria long gone now, its windows blank as dead eyes.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug still stood, known more for its cherry cola than any medicine it might dispense. The IGA grocery sat expensive and lonesome, folk choosing instead to make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General thrived like a weed in poor soil, its fluorescent lights drawing people like moths until closing time.\n\nThe furniture store called Possibilities had stood so long nobody remembered when it wasnt there, run by a woman whose kindness seemed a relic of some other time. Next door the pet groomers cleaned and cut and kept the animals of those who could afford such things. A doctor and a vet practiced their arts in separate buildings away from town, tending to what ills flesh might manifest.\n\nThe elementary school stood silent in summer, its children gone to middle and high school in the next town over like young birds pushed from the nest. They spoke of building a park, two and a half acres of manufactured joy, but for now the land lay empty as it had since time out of mind.\n\nNo theater here. No bowling alley. No place for youth to gather and dream of escape. Just the road through town, so quick a traveler might pass through between blinks and never know they'd been anywhere at all.",
            "The road cuts between two highways like a vein between arteries, the traffic moving past our house in perpetual motion, a reminder of the world beyond. We inhabit this corner where the street bends, watching the parade of metal and rubber that marks the passage of days. The neighbors we know by their vehicles, their faces, their routines. Strange cars draw our eyes like carrion birds to fresh kill.\n\nThe neighborhood stands as it has, houses rooted deep in what was once woodland. Trees tower above, their shadows pooling dark across yards where children pedal their bicycles in endless circles. Four souls dwell in our house - myself, the woman who shares my bed, and two girls, one eleven winters, the other fourteen. We remain close to home, our work tethered to these walls.\n\nThe seasons mark themselves in sounds. Lawnmowers drone from spring through fall, their mechanical growl echoing across fenced yards like some primitive ritual. When autumn comes the leaves descend, golden and rust-colored harbingers of winter. We burn them in piles, the smoke carrying memories of childhood into the gray sky. Winter has grown weak here, more ghost than season, leaving autumn to stretch like a dying man across the calendar.\n\nOur garage stands sentinel at the back of the house, the front door forgotten save for rare visitors who announce themselves with knuckles against wood. With the garage doors yawning open, I work on my truck, feeling the pulse of the neighborhood through the concrete floor. Metal against metal, tools speaking their own language.\n\nHolidays bring strange cars and foreign faces, relatives flooding the streets like water seeking low ground. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Mother's Day - the rhythm of family gathering and dispersing again, like waves against a shore. The neighborhood breathes these changes in and out.\n\nThis street serves as corridor between larger roads, and there lies its single flaw. But we abide here still, watching the world pass by our corner, marking time by the shadows of trees and the sound of children at play. It is not perfect, but it is ours.",
            "The land stretches brown and endless, dirt piled upon dirt like some ancient god's discarded earthworks. Unless you walked these grounds yourself you dont know what it means to see nothing but brown spreading out before you like a dead sea, and when you spy a patch of green lawn somewhere you know that man has paid dearly for his small victory over the desert. Time was in the nineties when houses stood far apart like sentinels in the waste but now they cluster closer though the spaces between still yawn wide and empty. The city grows like a cancer. Most places do.\n\nGood folk and bad folk both walk these streets same as anywhere. Round my place its mostly old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind screen doors. The stores aint much to speak of, just them chain outfits, Food For Less and such. Anything fancy means driving and driving far. No Whole Foods here. Construction work feeds most families, hammers ringing out across empty lots waiting to be filled. Sometimes that sound keeps me awake thinking about how the open spaces are dying. I ran from the big city once. Dont aim to live in another.\n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and ceiling work, following the build like them others. But its the animals make this place home. Folk come here for different reasons but mostly its the stark beauty does it, the way the desert just lies there naked under the sky. Different creatures live here, things that learned to survive in the heat and dust. People ought to learn about them, learn to live alongside them proper. My young ones, they took to it natural. Three of them out there now hunting lizards and beetles in the dust like little savages.\n\nThe county fair comes through sometimes. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like old men's beards and folk go up there to slide down them on boards. Down in the museum they keep bits of old bones and Indian things behind glass, telling stories about how this place came to be what it is. But mostly its just the desert and us, living in it day by day, watching the brown earth stretch away toward mountains that stand like ancient teeth against the sky.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some concrete vision of hell. Gray buildings rising up from the ashen earth, their windows dead and lightless in the morning sun. He thinks on how this place aint like other neighborhoods folk might speak of. No white picket fences here. No children's bicycles left carelessly in driveways. This here's different. This here's where he dwells.\n\nThe dormitory stands like a concrete monolith against the pale sky. Inside its bowels students sleep and wake and dream their dreams. Two to a cell mostly, packed in tight like prisoners serving time. The apartments aint much different. Twenty souls or thereabouts to each building, stacked two floors high like some architectural mockery of hope.\n\nThen there's the houses. Real houses. Alumni dwelling places scattered bout like bones bleached white in the sun. Two bedrooms. Sometimes four. Not many though. Efficiency aint in their nature and the powers that be know it well enough.\n\nThe people here. Lord the people here. They come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds moving through the concrete maze like blood through veins. Professional types in their pressed shirts occupying the houses while the young ones, green as spring corn, crowd the dormitories. The older students take to the apartments like refugees seeking higher ground.\n\nStores dot the landscape like pustules on diseased skin. Food places mostly. Clothing shops bearing the school's mark like brands on cattle. A grocery too. Everything a body might need within these borders, he reckons. And the park. One single park standing defiant against the spread of concrete and steel. Clean they keep it. Safe too. Though he wonders sometimes if anything in this world can truly be called safe anymore.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood. But it's his. And in the end that's all that matters in this godless place they call education.",
            "There aint no sidewalks here. Everything runs down like water finding its way to the sea and our house sits atop the highest ridge where the wind comes cold and constant. They call it the workout hill on account of the runners who come daily to test themselves against its grade. Folk walk in the road because there aint nowhere else to walk. The blacktop's scarred and pocked like an old man's face, treacherous to them that dont know its ways. Above hang the wires, twisted and spliced and mended a hundred times over from storms that come without warning or mercy. The trees stand tall and dark, evergreens stretching toward a gray heaven, but the people here hate them for blocking their view of the water and cut them down whenever they can. Houses rise up like glass-faced sentinels, each trying to peer over the shoulder of the one before it to catch a glimpse of the bay below.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns like molten copper but most days the clouds hang low and heavy, wrapping everything in a perpetual twilight. The moss claims whatever stands still long enough, painting the world in shades of green. Left my truck idle for a month once and found it transformed into something ancient and primordial, took hours to reclaim it from the green.\n\nAint many children here though theres a school close by. Old folk mostly, retired and waiting. Dogs run free instead of children, appearing like ghosts in yards and doorways. Found one in my living room once, standing there like it owned the place. Rabbits too, big as cats some of them, digging up gardens til my cats got to hunting them down. Birds wheel overhead - tiny ones that flit between branches and great raptors that the crows drive off like army squadrons protecting their territory.\n\nNo stores nearby but down by the water where the land gives way to stone there's places that serve up what the bay provides. The beach aint much but the rocks make good missiles to hurl into the gray waters. The opposite shore stands clear most days through the mist like some promised land we cant quite reach.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some great beast sprawled across Brooklyn, its concrete arteries pulsing with the blood of subway trains running deep beneath the earth. The streets stretched out before you like the fingers of a dead man's hand, each one lined with two-story houses standing shoulder to shoulder in their eternal vigil.\n\nThe Asians had come. Twenty years past they'd settled here and made it their own. Their stores rose up from the sidewalks like mushrooms after rain, signs in languages that looked like broken birds scattered across storefronts. Markets and laundries mostly. Four such markets within sight of each other, their produce spilling out onto the concrete in wooden crates. Good food and cheap too. The kind of places where old women would barter in tongues unknown.\n\nThe park stood renovated and raw. Basketball courts stretched out like graves, ten of them, and beyond that the soccer field lay green and vast. Children played there in the summer heat, their dark faces glistening under the spray of water fountains. All colors of mankind gathered there, their children mingling like drops of paint in a vast palette.\n\nNo towers here. No glass and steel monuments to greed. Just the low buildings squatting in their own shadows. Co-ops and condos rose up here and there but mostly it was the two-family houses, packed tight like books on a shelf. The streets never slept. Music blasted from passing cars like the war cries of mechanical beasts, engines roaring in the night like demons unleashed from some automotive hell.\n\nNight brought its own terrors. The darkness held teeth and claws, thieves and bullies prowling like coyotes. He remembered the beating he'd taken years ago, remembered the taste of blood and concrete. These days the thieves took packages instead of blood, but the darkness remained unchanged.\n\nDog shit everywhere. Like some biblical plague visited upon the sidewalks. No matter the fines, no matter the laws, it lay there in wait every morning. A reminder perhaps that even in this concrete wilderness, nature would have its say. The city had tried to tame it with ordinances and threats but still it remained, testament to man's eternal struggle against the base and primal things that lurked at the edges of civilization.",
            "You got to understand what weird means in Portland Oregon. Aint no simple thing. Up on that old building where they serve pizza and liquor and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws quiet-like, the words stand stark against the gray sky: Keep Portland Weird. Some folk remember it different, back before the money came, when weird meant something pure and raw in the rain-soaked streets. Others hear it like a calling, come here where your strangeness aint no burden to bear.\n\nThe Californians keep coming. Building their glass towers reaching up into the perpetual clouds like fingers of some desperate god. But the weird persists. Not the kind that welcomes all, mind you, but the kind that takes in what others cast out. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in every store, same fights, same troubles. Got our share of normal too - them yoga folk and hipsters in their tight pants and the business types with their clean shoes. Maybe we just dont hold so tight to the pretending.\n\nWhere I stay at, houses painted like fever dreams. Gardens growing wild right up through the concrete, herbs and flowers fighting for space with the vegetables. Come summer the free boxes appear like mushrooms after rain. Cardboard prophecies filled with castoff dreams. Books and clothes mostly, but sometimes treasures that seem placed there by some knowing hand, waiting for the right soul to pass by.\n\nThe rain it comes and stays. Dark clouds hanging low enough to touch, bringing with them the shadows in mens minds. Got them that chase dragons in the streets, them that sleep under bridges cause theres nowhere else to go. Services better than most places but still aint enough. Never is. The people who got homes, they swing between mercy and hate like a broken compass seeking true north.\n\nThe soccer crowds fill the streets some days. Other folk bend themselves into shapes while goats walk on their backs. Each to their own peculiar worship. Some chase dreams, others drown them in beer glasses. All of us weird in our own way, or maybe none of us weird at all. Just people trying to make sense of the world in this corner of it, where the rain falls more days than not and the weird aint so much a choice as it is the air we breathe.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. North they rise like ancient gods bearing witness to the coming and going of light. A man might forget them in the blur of days and toil but they remain, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of men. And when the weight of living bears down heavy they command attention and in their presence a soul might find rest, might draw strength enough to weather one more dawn, one more dusk. \n\nI came here young, barely more than a boy, drawn to those northern peaks that loomed above the campus grounds. The university itself held beauty in its way, old buildings and still ponds and trees that had seen a hundred summers come and go, but the mountains ruled over all like silent kings. The town spread below them like a supplicant, all brick and mortar weathered by time. Coffee houses where students hunched over books in the small hours, their faces pale in the fluorescent light. The downtown streets where old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their facades speaking of times long past when men believed in permanence. There the city showed its teeth, its vigor, but it didnt last. Beyond the library the quiet returned like a tide.\n\nThe city was two things at once, busy and still, loud and quiet. A man could lose himself in its streets and find himself again. Memory clung to every corner like cobwebs. Good memories of walking past rusted playground swings with friends when the night was old, of running through crowded streets to catch pictures at the theater. But darker memories too, the kind that haunt a man in the small hours. Id stood by those ponds watching turtles and waterfowl going about their business while I searched for meaning in my own existence. Id shed tears there at two in the morning when the weight of living grew too heavy.\n\nOne morning I walked past the pond, past the park with its neat houses standing in rows like headstones. I walked until I reached the main road. The sun was coming up, painting the sky in fire, setting the palm fronds ablaze with light. I looked north. There they stood as they had always stood, those mountains older than memory, their peaks cutting into the dawn sky like knives. They spoke without speaking, and in their presence I found the will to endure.",
            "You wouldnt see it first off. Just houses behind some stores. Not the kind of place folk'd choose to dwell in. But go on past that dead Whole Foods building, past them hotels that only fill when summer brings the families back like migrating birds, and there's life there. Real life. Streets lined with apartment buildings stood up like old dominos waiting to fall, all in a row neat as you please. First ones got trouble in em. Been in the papers. We wont speak on that. But them others next door and the ones after, they're different somehow. Like stepping into another world entirely.\n\nCross the way there's this college. Small thing. Just some buildings keeping watch over the road where sleepy students drift in with their coffee cups at dawn. Iron gates scream on their hinges letting em through while folks in cars curse the delay, their fists raised up like flags of surrender to the morning.\n\nRoad ends at another, T-shaped like a gallows. Park on one side. Other side's got this place where broken people go to mend. Got chairs out front where nobody sits and a fan that just pushes the thick air around and around like God stirring soup.\n\nChildren spin in the grass like fallen leaves. Bees drift drunk between flowers. Old folk walk their dogs, eyeing the skateboard kids like they was carrying plague, nodding to girls bunched up by the swings talking about whatever girls talk about these days.\n\nStrip mall's got this sushi place. Empty mostly. Swimming store next door. Nail place between. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish. There's this yogurt shop too where kids go to feel grown, sucking sugar through plastic straws and blowing vapor in the air like they was dragons in a fairy tale.\n\nWhole place is like some picture of America that got stuck in time. South moving slow as molasses, holding onto what it knows, refusing to let go. Time dont mean much here. Never did.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels of some forgotten age. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins in their death throes. Small patches of yard lay before each dwelling and strips of concrete they called driveways stretched alongside like pale fingers reaching for something long gone. These were the remnants of that old dream. The American dream they'd called it. It had wrapped itself round the throat of a nation and now was slowly loosening its grip leaving only these neighborhoods behind. Testament to what was. What might have been.\n\nThe yards aint kept like they once were and the people's eyes dont shine with that old light but still the machines rest in the driveways like sleeping beasts and still the young ones play in the street like there aint nothing else in all the world that matters. The schoolhouse stands yet. Ninety years of brick and mortar promising futures it maybe cant deliver no more while stirring up ghosts in them that's old enough to remember. Churches scattered and empty but the basketball courts full of life like blood pooling in the wounds of a dying thing.\n\nHouses different as brothers but carrying the same blood. That market run by them Yemen folk, probably the only Arab blood for miles in this sea of black faces. Streets wide as rivers where children play their games, pausing only when the cars come through like metal leviathans. Most folks been here since there was a here to be in. They'll tell you tales of when everybody knew everybody else's name and business too.\n\nWhere the karate school once stood now there's a pharmacy. Seems fitting somehow. Dreams of being the karate kid replaced by little white pills that make the dreams go away altogether. The picture show still runs, showing yesterday's stories at yesterday's prices. The young ones dont go there no more but the old folks, they remember.\n\nThat expressway cuts through like a concrete snake but it dont stop here. They tried once to make it stop. Young blood wanted it, old blood didn't. Old blood won out like it usually does in matters such as these. They're raising up a new school now and talking about what creature should stand for what they are. But how do you capture what cant be captured? How do you draw the shape of a dying dream?",
            "The city sprawls vast and restless, a thing alive and breathing with its own dark pulse. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a perpetual haze of exhaust and industry, their windows dead and lightless in the afternoon glare. Streets wind through the maze of steel and glass, some broad as rivers, others narrow as cattle chutes, all of them gorged with vehicles moving slow as blood through dying veins.\n\nThe people here exist in their separate tribes though sometimes they intersect like old migratory paths crossing in the waste. Orthodox Jews in their black hats and coats move like shadows through the streets while nearby rainbow flags hang limp and faded above doorways where the queer folk gather. Further out lie the ethnic boroughs - Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia - each one a world contained within itself, each speaking in tongues foreign to the others.\n\nHe remembered playing in these streets as a child, back when neighbors still knew one another's names and children ran wild in the gathering dusk. But those days were long dead now. The city had swallowed such things. Now apartment towers rose like concrete mushrooms after rain, their residents stacked in steel boxes reaching toward a sky they'd never touch. Traffic choked the arteries of the city day and night. Ten miles might take two hours to traverse, the vehicles crawling bumper to bumper like a funeral procession with no end and no beginning.\n\nConstruction cranes turned slow circles overhead, building more towers, more boxes to house the endless waves of newcomers drawn to this place like moths to flame. The old residents watched with dead eyes as their city transformed, as parking spaces became scarce as water in the desert, as the streets grew more crowded with each passing season.\n\nHouses still stood in places, holdouts from an older time. Single family homes and duplexes hunched between the towers like dying breeds facing extinction. But they too would fall in time. The city was hungry and patient. It would consume everything in the end. That's what cities do. They feed and grow and change until nothing remains of what once was. Until even memory fades like old photographs left too long in the sun.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn, the fields stretching out into nothing. This is it, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The corn went on and on like some biblical plague, row after row until the horizon swallowed them whole. I told her bout growing up here in this emptiness, this Ohio nowhere, and something in her eyes changed like she finally understood the making of me.\n\nPast the waterlogged quarry you come to where the houses stand. Brick and stucco dwellings each with its plot of ground that folk tend like their own small kingdoms. Come spring the flowers rise up out of the earth and the trees shed their winter bones for new flesh. Mercedes automobiles gleam in driveways like chrome beacons, proud testimonies to prosperity in this heartland waste.\n\nThe Korean lives next door, ancient now but still singing while he rides his mower in endless circles. Once was a doctor they say though now he's just the old man who tends the grass, moving slow like some ritual dance between the property lines. Time has taken pieces of his mind but left his gentle nature intact.\n\nOur house stands gray against the sky. Geese patrol the yard while the terrier gives chase, both caught in some eternal game neither can win. The stream out back feeds the quarry, carrying with it the sounds of frogs and distant cattle lowing in the dark. Cross the wooden bridge we built with our hands and you'll find what's left of the wild world. Trees stand sentinel over herbs and flowers that grew according to no man's plan. Here's where childhood lived, where we built our wooden fortresses in the trees and played at being hunters though we never killed nothing worth killing.\n\nWinter comes harsh as judgment to this land. The yard that was green turns to emptiness, trees stripped to bone and sinew against the gray sky. Snow comes like a blessing some nights, turning all to white silence. My sister would leave her angels pressed in the snow while we waged our wars with frozen ammunition, building walls of ice and stick like we could hold back time itself. We were gods then in our small kingdom, when nothing mattered but the game and the next handful of snow and the sound of our own laughter echoing across the frozen waste."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This land aint got no towers of glass nor concrete fortresses they call malls. No Walmart. No Target. Just earth and water and sky stretched out like God himself laid it bare. Michigan they call it but that dont capture the truth of it. Two lakes hem us in like ancient sentinels. Lake Michigan to the west, vast and cold and gray, Lake Charlevoix to the east, both of them carrying secrets older than man.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old soldiers who've seen too much to crowd together. Each one different, each one bearing the marks of time and weather and the hands that built them. Basements dug deep into the earth, visible from the road like open wounds in the ground. Aluminum siding gone silver with age, colors faded but holding on, defiant against the elements.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs too, and people on wheels and feet, moving through the days like spirits. Neighbors know neighbors here. You can tell who belongs and who dont. The ground beneath is kept clean and green, no dead leaves left to rot, no grass grown wild. Not beautiful maybe, not like them magazines show, but something more important. Something real.\n\nWithin walking distance stands the sheriff's jail, gray and solemn as a headstone. The health department too, and the place where they sort through what people throw away.

Small planes growl overhead, metal birds casting shadows on the earth below.\n\nYou can walk to get ice cream here, real ice cream, not that stuff they sell in boxes in them big stores. Downtown aint far neither, if your legs'll carry you. Children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through streets that know their names. This here's a place where people can breathe, where they can live without looking over their shoulder every minute. It aint perfect maybe, but it's got something that them bigger places lost long ago. Something true.\n\nWe're surrounded by water here, like them old tales of paradise. Every which way you turn theres a beach waiting, water lapping at the shore like time itself trying to wear away at the edges of our world. This here's a place where a body can plant their feet and know they're standing on something real. Something that'll hold.",
            "He stood at the entrance to the development watching the sameness stretch out before him like some terrible vision of conformity made manifest in stucco and concrete. The homes stood in their rows, each yard a mirror of the last, grass cut to precise heights as if measured by some godless instrument. Small trees dotted the landscape at measured intervals, their shadows falling on decorative stone that had never known the touch of natural placement.\n\nThe homeowners association ruled here like some faceless authority from an age long past. Their presence hung in the air like a specter, manifest in the pristine driveways and the mechanical precision of every architectural choice. Two-car garages lined the streets like empty eyes staring out at nothing.\n\nThe roads lay perfect and unmarred, as if suffering itself had been outlawed here. No potholes marred the concrete, no imperfection dared show its face. At the end of each street stood clusters of mailboxes, metal sentinels requiring keys like some ritual of belonging. They'd banned the individual boxes, those small totems of personality, in favor of uniformity.\n\nThe neighborhood pressed against the city's edge where civilization met wilderness, though both had been tamed here. Community pools lay behind their gates like blue mirrors reflecting nothing but order. Walking trails wound through the manufactured wild, paths laid down for those seeking the illusion of nature's touch.\n\nThe retired folk who dwelt here kept watch from behind their windows, their presence a kind of sentinel against disorder. Young professionals moved among them like ghosts, all of them bound by invisible covenants to maintain this artificial peace.\n\nBeyond lay the city proper, its mall standing alone like some commercial monument to necessity. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to the stores, those temples of commerce where organic produce lay alongside discount goods in their separate kingdoms of plenty.\n\nHe thought about how they'd tamed even time here, how they'd stripped away the chaos of life and replaced it with something controllable. The sun set over the development the same as it had yesterday and would tomorrow, casting shadows across a place where even darkness had been negotiated into submission.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the missing. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more each month to inhabit. None I knew had heard such tales. Perhaps it's the weight of living pressing down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, the musty clothes and broken toys. The scents of childhood fade. Some take to tobacco, others just forget what clean air tastes like. But the flea market abides. The smell of growing old is magazines yellow with age atop a piano that won't sing no more. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned.\n\nThree thrift stores within walking. Start at the far end and you can work your way through charity shops, the library with its quiet rooms, rare books behind glass, curiosities in dusty cases. Downtown's full up with metal and flesh, morning til night, but in the thrift stores time stops. Silent as a tomb no matter the chaos outside. Good place to lose yourself. More folk coming every year now. Growing city, they say. Some big company dealing in packages and promises set up here. Like New York in its way. Everyone got their own purpose and none asks much of you. Can keep to yourself, quiet-like, and folk leave you be. Not like down South where concern means caring. Here you don't pry and the city rolls past like waves on dark shores.\n\nLife moves through it though. Got a piano player next door, singers up above. Less strangers than a kind of family. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Lucky maybe. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I got it. Carry their mail, they carry mine. Good to see them, think they feel the same. Living in this concrete maze might seem like damnation but these people, these neighbors of mine, make me think I ain't ruined everything just yet.",
            "The town lay just beyond the reach of the city's sprawl, a small heartland place where the east side bore the marks of harder times. Houses stood weathered and wanting, their values low as the winter sun, rented or owned by folk who knew the taste of empty cupboards. Not an ugly place though. Not that. Neighbors would nod and speak their mornings, their faces lined with stories untold.\n\nThe darkness came sometimes. Violence had marked its territory these past years. Gunshots had torn the night air not three blocks from where we slept. The neighbors boy, taken by lead and powder outside some barroom, his mother's tears still fresh in the soil. Our own losses measured smaller - trinkets gone missing from the porch, carried off like birds in the night.\n\nThe poison ran deep here, same as everywhere now. Fentanyl moving like a ghost through the streets, taking souls quick or slow. But there were those who fought it, teaching others how to pull the dying back from that far shore, running centers where the broken could seek mending.\n\nThe school stood like a beacon. My boy, different in his ways, found shelter there among teachers who saw past difference to the child within. No child went hungry inside those walls, breakfast and lunch free as air, no shame in empty pockets. Parents gathered there too, building something larger than themselves.\n\nThe town fathers poured money into the center streets and western reaches, where commerce flowed. Our side stayed forgotten, streets patched like old quilts, parks gone to seed. Some spoke against this but words dried up like rain on hot pavement.\n\nSixteen years we'd made our home here, in this house that weren't worth much but held us safe. The town had worked its way into our bones, become the ground we walked. Couldn't imagine calling anywhere else home now. Some places mark you that way, write themselves into your story until you can't tell where they end and you begin.",
            "The neighborhood perched high like some ancient sentinel, its bones made of history and mortar and the memories of dead men. Seven stories up I dwelled across from where the theater stood weathered and old, its marquee dark and peeling like the shed skin of something once alive. Down the hill there was a place where folk gathered when the nights grew warm, lined up like cattle waiting for slaughter but there wasnt any slaughter just games and drink and the crush of bodies seeking respite from the world outside.\n\nThe park lay a few blocks distant. Concrete wrapped round it like a noose, steps carved into its throat where the homeless made their camp in the wet season. They lined their tents in rows neat as headstones, huddled together against the rain that fell eternal in these parts. No snow came but the damp got in your bones just the same. They stayed close to where they could wash, where they could remember what it was to be human.\n\nThis place they called Hilltop had been blood ground once. Gang territory. Even now stories passed like scripture of federal men come to sweep clean what could never be cleaned. The people remembered. They always remembered. Tales passed down like family bibles, mother to child, stranger to stranger, about days when death walked these streets wearing colors and carrying steel.\n\nThey said whites shouldnt walk here after dark but that was old fear talking, ghosts of dead prejudice haunting these hills. Maybe it was my skin being just dark enough or maybe the Hill knew its own, knew who understood the weight of history and the stain of ignorance that still marked this supposed paradise of cultures mixed and mingled.\n\nThe streets knew me and I knew them. Id seen kindness here in the dark places where none should exist. Laundry women whod keep their doors open just a minute longer, strangers whod offer warmth against the cold. Id huddled invisible against storefronts in the gray nothing of night only to be seen, truly seen, by some passing soul whod press paper money in my hand and speak of worth and beauty like a prayer.\n\nThe Hill was home. Nothing else to it. Just home.",
            "I came here in the eighth grade of my youth, to a place that would shape the years ahead. The houses stood like sentinels, two stories tall, identical and watchful in their suburban uniformity. At first the loneliness was a thing that lived inside me but then there were two boys, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, though they're gone now, scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. But the memory of them remains, etched in the concrete and the quiet afternoons.\n\nThe neighborhood stands unchanged. Silent most days save for the sound of children's voices carrying on the warm air, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. The people here keep to themselves except in times of need, like creatures in a desert waiting for the rain. Trust lives here still. Packages appear and remain untouched on porches like offerings to some domestic god.\n\nThere's a park nearby, not more than a whisper away. The basketball court and the baseball diamond and the football field where blood once flowed from my nose after an elbow caught me wrong, the memory of it sharp and metallic like a copper penny on the tongue. Now I take my cousin's children there, watch them swing and slide in the dying light of day, their joy pure and uncontaminated by time. The park holds ghosts now, memories that drift through the chain link fences like ash on the wind.\n\nThe streets around us pulse with life and food from every corner of the world. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All of it brought to doors now by young men and women carrying plastic bags like modern day deliverers of sustenance. Fast food joints squat on corners like concrete toads, their neon signs bleeding into the night. The stores stand shoulder to shoulder offering everything a body might need. Walgreens. CVS. The Jewel-Osco where the midwest does its marketing. Even an Indian store where spices sit in glass jars like captured sunsets.\n\nI've seen the stories of neighborhood wars fought on glowing screens and heard tales of feuds that burn like eternal flames, and I know that what we have here is rare as gold and twice as precious. This place, these streets, these people - they are a tapestry woven of peace and quiet understanding. And in these times that's a thing worth holding onto with both hands.",
            "The college stands near where I live, close enough to walk. Apartment buildings rise up like dead sentinels, their windows dark and watching. Between them stand the bars and eating houses where students gather, spending what little money they have on watered drinks and microwaved sustenance. They renamed one of the bars recent. More costly now but the spirits flow just the same.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes. Students with their books and dreams and the poor folk who've always been here, dwelling in the cheap rooms above. Children too, many of them, drawn by the elementary school that squats behind chain link nearby. My neighbors I do not know. Would not want to. The sweet reek of their smoking seeps beneath doors while management fights a futile war with artificial freshness pumped through vents.\n\nOld buildings crowd together, their facades weathered and peeling like dead skin though some hide renewed interiors behind their decay. Down the road stand newer structures, false promises of luxury built quick and cheap, charging gold prices for cardboard walls. They know the students will come regardless. The restaurant across serves food on paper, everything heated in boxes that hum. The gas station beside it bears witness to tired workers moving through their days like ghosts.\n\nThe city put money in once. New concrete paths snake between fresh-planted grass but cannot hide what lies beneath. Trees crowd thick around my building, their brothers cut down to stumps that dot the earth like grave markers. Behind us lies 43rd Street, meaner than ours, its walkways broken and buildings lurking behind vegetation gone wild. Violence lives there sometimes, though it visits our side too, carried on night winds between the complexes.\n\nBut I stay. The price is right and the buses come regular, metal beetles carrying us to market and downtown. The university waits within walking distance, promising something better. Or at least different. Sometimes that's enough.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass before the drought takes it. They'd built them to look separate but they aint. Folk gather some evenings at the end of whatever drive suits them best, watching their young ones mark the concrete with colored chalk or send their kites up into whatever wind God provides. Like stepping back through time itself, he thought. A respite from the cold mechanical world that had taken hold of everything else.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up against skies so blue they hurt to look at. But the weather turns cruel sometimes. Last night the sirens came wailing through the darkness, their sound carrying death in it. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever treasures seemed worth saving while the big one paced the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. Hail came down like God's own judgment, covering the ground in white fury. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing its last, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five quick as a heart stops beating. The hail disappeared into the hot pavement like it never was. Then the sun broke through and the rain came with it, and there in the sky hung two rainbows like some ancient sign.\n\nNeighbors emerged slow and cautious from wherever they'd took shelter, and soon enough the mothers was back out watching their young ones while supper cooked inside. Strange music in their southern voices, different from the northern sounds I'd known before. The houses might look alike outside but inside they're as different as the souls that inhabit them. Some small as prison cells, some opening up like churches.\n\nBehind it all lies the big field and the pond where swimming aint allowed. Deer move through there like ghosts at dawn and dusk. The bullfrogs sing their morning prayers and roosters call from the surrounding farms like preachers calling sinners to worship. A donkey brays in the evening darkness, reminding us all that we aint alone in this world. Found this place like finding gold in river mud, forty minutes from the city but might as well be forty years from anywhere.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Time stretches long like a black road with no end. When we first come here from Riverdale to Stockbridge my eyes ran wet with salt and grief for them I'd left behind. Mama and daddy they wanted better for us. For me and the little sister both. Said the schools was better here. Said it wasnt like them other places where the devil's work gets done in broad daylight.\n\nYears pass like dead leaves in the wind. Made some friends. Made some enemies too. Didnt know many neighbors except old Glen and Dennis living right alongside us. Good people. Like blood kin almost. I member that time Glen got hitched again. The whole family went. Mama daddy sister and me. White dress and cake and dancing. That woman Veda she threw that white thing off her leg and somehow it found its way to my hands like it knew where to land. Didnt catch them flowers though. Danced with Marsharii that night. Aint seen her since. Sometimes I wonder where the wind carried her.\n\nThis place is like them old mazes where you cant see the way out. Got me one of them GPS things now though. Started exploring with Kason and Curtis. We was always playing them video games. Living like there wasnt no tomorrow. Sometimes I go down to that park. Something about it soothes what needs soothing inside. Take them sticks from the hardware store. Practice my balance like them old monks might've done. Sometimes bring my wooden sword too. Basketball court sits empty most days. Tennis court too. Daddy and Mr Graves taught us tennis when we was young. Worked us till we could hardly stand but we smiled through it all.\n\nReckon I've lived enough stories in this place to fill a book. But them memories I told about, they stick like burrs to wool. Sometimes I look out past the houses and trees and think maybe the best aint happened yet. Maybe it's out there waiting like a promise. Like something written in stone before the world was born.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, nestled in the heart of South Carolina where the peach trees stood sentinel over the land. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World emblazoned on a weathered sign that greeted those few who passed through. Fields stretched out beyond sight, dotted with cattle and orchards that had been there longer than any living soul could reckon.\n\nThe houses stood apart from one another like strangers at a wake. Metal roofs gleaming in the merciless summer sun, or gray shingles dulled by time and weather. Set back from the road they were, behind fields where beasts grazed and crops rose from the earth like prayers.\n\nIn the heart of it all hung a single stoplight, swaying gentle above a fourway crossing where what passed for commerce gathered. Hong Kong, run by a family whose story was written in their eyes. Fiesta. Gary's with its burgers. The pizzeria gone now, nothing but an empty shell and memories of better days. Maxwell and Halford's where they sold cherry cola that tasted like childhood. IGA where folk bought what they needed but not what they wanted, saving their dollars for the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, that concrete cathedral of commerce.\n\nDollar General stood like a beacon, drawing them in from sunup to sundown. Possibilities Furniture where a woman known to all sold pieces that would outlive their owners. Clark's where they tended to the animals. Doctor's office and veterinary both, small but necessary as breath itself.\n\nThe school stood alone, Johnston Elementary, sending its children away after fifth grade like young birds pushed from the nest. No parks yet, though they spoke of one. Two and a half acres of promise that might never come to pass.\n\nNo picture shows or bowling alleys or places where youth might gather. No grounds for walking dogs or sitting in the shade. Just the land and the peach trees and the cattle and the people who called it home. Small enough to miss in the blink of an eye, like a tear shed for something beautiful and forgotten.",
            "The street runs between two highways, a vein of asphalt carrying the lifeblood of commerce and strangers through what might otherwise be sanctuary. We abide here, my wife and daughters and I, watching from our corner perch like sentinels of some forgotten outpost. The girls are eleven and fourteen, still young enough to find wonder in the rain.\n\nThe neighborhood holds its own against time. Few move in, fewer leave. Each house keeps its stories close, yards tended with quiet dedication, the drone of mowers marking time from March till October when the grass finally yields to winter's approach. Ancient trees tower above, remnants of what was here before, their shadows stretching across lawns like dark fingers. Come autumn they shed their burden and the air fills with smoke from leaf fires, that ancient perfume of seasons changing.\n\nWe work from home, our house both shelter and prison, watching the parade of familiar vehicles pass. Any strange car draws eyes like a wolf among sheep. Children pedal their bikes in endless circles, dogs walk their masters in morning mist, and the whole world seems to turn on its own axis, separate from the chaos beyond our borders.\n\nThe garage stands sentinel at the back, its doors like eyes when opened, watching over the street where I work on my truck, hands black with grease and mind empty of everything save the task. The front door stays shut, unused, a relic of formality. Holidays bring strange cars and distant kin, metal and flesh both gleaming with newness, but they pass like storms, leaving the street to its own devices.\n\nWinter comes seldom now, as if the seasons themselves have lost their way. Autumn stretches endless, the trees holding their leaves longer each year, the sleds on our hill gathering dust. Were it not for the constant flow of traffic, this place might be perfect. But perfection died with the old world, and we make do with what remains.",
            "The land stretches out brown and endless, dirt upon dirt and more dirt still, like some biblical curse laid down in ancient times. They dont know, them that aint lived here, what it means to wake each morning to that vast brownness spreading out in all directions, how a patch of green lawn marks a man who'd empty his wallet just to see something grow. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart like sentinels in the waste but now they crowd closer, though still with space between like they fear touching. The city grows like some slow cancer eating at the edges of the desert but that's the way of all places now.\n\nGood folk and bad folk both walk these streets same as anywhere. Round my place its mostly old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind screen doors. The stores aint nothing special, just them chain places with their bright signs and empty promises. No fancy markets here. You want that kind of thing youll need to drive and drive far.\n\nThe builders they come like vultures to fresh kill. They see all this empty space and their eyes get bright with the possibilities of profit. Sometimes watching them I get a sick feeling deep in my gut knowing they'll fill it all someday. Left the big city to get away from all that. Now I work construction myself, hanging drywall and ceiling grids, watching the desert disappear one room at a time.\n\nBut the animals. They was here first and they stay on, living in the spaces between. Folk come here for different reasons but mainly for that stark terrible beauty of it all. The desert, she makes her own rules about what lives and what dies. The wildlife, they know these rules better than any man. My younguns, they spend their days chasing lizards and insects like some primitive hunters, learning the ways of this hard land same as the creatures they pursue.\n\nWe got our attractions sure enough. The county fair comes round once a year like some traveling carnival of normalcy. Folks can drive up to Wrightwood, see the snow on the mountains like God's own frosting. The museum stands testament to what was here before - bones and artifacts and remnants of peoples long gone to dust. But its the desert herself that holds the real story, written in sand and stone and the long silence of empty places.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland. Buildings old and gray rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. He reckons it different from what others might call neighborhood but it is his and he knows no other. The dormitory stands sentinel among lesser structures, its windows dark and watching. Within dwell the others. His people. His community such as it is.\n\nThree kinds of dwelling here in this stone and metal maze. The apartments first, stacked boxes of glass and steel where souls cluster two and four to a room, twenty or more to a building, all of them pressed together in their shared solitude. Then the houses proper, scattered few among the grounds like artifacts of some forgotten domestic age. Alumni dwelling there in twos and fours, hanging on to what was. Last the dormitories themselves. Great concrete hives where hundreds sleep and wake and dream their dreams of what's to come. Two to a cell mostly. Steel beds. Institutional walls. The fluorescent light falling cold and dead across empty halls at night.\n\nThey come from everywhere, these people. All colors, all tongues. The professional staff in their little houses at the margins, new students in the great concrete dormitories, the older ones in their apartment warrens. No words could capture the whole of them. Better to let them be what they are.\n\nThe stores stand in rows like tired soldiers. Places to eat, places to buy whatever they need to survive here in this manufactured world. A park too, though calling it that seems wrong somehow. Just a space they keep clean between the buildings where sometimes they gather, these disparate souls all thrown together in this place that is neither city nor town but something else entirely. Something unnamed.\n\nHe looks out across it all in the failing light. The buildings rising dark against the sky. The paths between them empty now save for a few wandering figures, their shadows long and thin in the evening sun. This is his neighborhood. His world. For better or worse, this is where he dwells.",
            "The road runs empty where I live, winding up past houses perched like watchful birds on the highest ground any man might find to build upon. No sidewalks here. Just broken asphalt and the long slope rising cruel and merciless before you, a thing joggers seek out in their endless circling of these streets. They come and go like wraiths in the morning fog. The power lines hang loose and patched, victims of countless storms that sweep in off the water bringing rain and destruction and leaving behind only silence and the sound of dripping eaves.\n\nThe evergreens stand dark against the sky but they wont stand long. Men here hate them with a hatred pure and cold as winter. They fall to saws and axes, their stumps pulled from the earth like rotting teeth to clear the view of water beyond. Houses rise up proud and gleaming with their walls of glass, each trying to outreach the other in their hunger for the bay below. When the sun sets the water burns orange and gold but most days theres nothing but gray. Gray sky. Gray water. Gray mist that shrouds it all in a veil thick as grief.\n\nThe moss claims everything here. It grows wild and unchecked, turning cars and rooftops into fuzzy green monuments to decay. Left my own vehicle sitting idle once and found it transformed, had to scrape three hours to find metal underneath all that green fur.\n\nNo children here to speak of though theres a school close by. Just old folk watching their days wind down slow as the tide. Dogs run loose and fearless, pushing through open doors like they own them. Found one in my living room once, staring at me with eyes that held no apology. The rabbits too have claimed this place for their own, great fat things that dig up gardens until the cats hunt them down. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds mostly, though sometimes a hawk or eagle cuts through the air until the crows drive it off with their black wings beating like war drums.\n\nDown by the water where the restaurants serve up whatever the sea gives them that day, theres nothing but rocks and more rocks. The bay sits narrow and still, the far shore always visible through the mist like some half-remembered dream of solid ground.",
            "Bensonhurst lay before him like some vast concrete labyrinth, a maze of weathered brownstone and tired brick stretching toward a colorless sky. The trains came and went like metal serpents, their bellies full of the restless souls who'd made this corner of Brooklyn their temporary hell or heaven. He'd seen it change, seen the old Italian facades give way to signs in languages he couldn't read, their characters strange and beautiful like some ancient calligraphy.\n\nThe Asians had come slowly at first then all at once, like water through a broken dam. Their stores stood now on every corner, bright and clean and foreign. Markets full of fruits he'd never known existed, their flesh strange and wonderful. Laundromats humming their endless cycles, steam rising like ghosts in the fluorescent light. The old residents watched it happen and said nothing, for the food was good and the prices fair and what more could a man want in these godless times.\n\nHe walked past four markets within two minutes, each one a mirror of the last, each one full of voices speaking in tongues he'd never learn. The neighborhood was a babel of sorts, generations of immigrants layered like geological strata, their children speaking in tongues both old and new.\n\nThe park stood renewed, a concrete paradise where children played at being children. Basketball courts stretched like a graveyard of dreams, the thump of rubber on asphalt a heartbeat in the urban silence. Water fountains sprayed their blessing in summer, baptizing the young ones who shrieked and ran through the artificial rain.\n\nAt night the streets changed their nature. Music thundered from passing cars like war drums, engines roared their defiance at the darkness. The weak were prey here, as they had always been. He remembered the fists, the hatred in strange eyes, the theft of small things left unguarded. Even the dogs left their mark, their waste like small brown monuments to man's indifference.\n\nHe watched it all from his window, this theater of humanity playing out its endless acts. The houses stood shoulder to shoulder like weary soldiers, two families to each, all of them dreaming their separate dreams of better days. This was Bensonhurst, neither heaven nor hell but somewhere in between, where the trains ran on time and the markets never closed and the night was full of sounds that might have been music or might have been screams.",
            "You got to understand what weird means in Portland Oregon. Aint no simple thing. Words painted up on some building downtown that serves pizza and liquor and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws nobody seems to mind about. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk remember the old days when the city was cheaper and stranger and filled with its own particular madness. Others come seeking sanctuary for their own peculiarities, drawn like moths to the dim glow of acceptance.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their ways. Steel and glass boxes rise up to house them but the weird persists like some stubborn weed in concrete. Aint the same as acceptance mind you. The weird just means we take in what others cast out. We got our modern contraptions same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere. Normal folk doing normal things but somehow less burdened by it all.\n\nIn my quarter of the city the houses stand painted in colors that'd shame a sunset. Gardens growing wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers pushing up through cracks in the earth like memories of some forgotten paradise. And there's them free boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass by. Books and clothes mainly but could be anything. Magic in them boxes. Real magic sometimes, if you believe in such things.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray and constant like God's own melancholy. Drives some folk to darkness, to needles and bottles and sleeping rough under bridges. City tries to help but help aint never enough. The ones with homes look on them that aint got none with mixed hearts. Love and hate wrestling in their chests like brother killing brother.\n\nSome folk do their goat yoga. Some wave flags for the soccer boys. Some dig through boxes on sidewalks looking for treasure. All of us weird in our own particular way, carrying our dreams like crosses, drowning them in beer when they get too heavy. Aint so different from anywhere else in that regard. Just less ashamed of it maybe. Less inclined to hide what we are.\n\nThe weird persists. Like cockroaches after fire. Like hope in a dead world. Like love in a heart turned to stone.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel. North they rise like ancient gods bearing witness to the coming and going of light, to the passing of all things mortal and fleeting. A man might forget them in the crush and grind of his days but they remain, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of flesh and bone. And when the weight of living bears down heavy as stone they command attention with their jagged truth, offering up some measure of strength to the weary soul that looks upon them. Not peace exactly but perhaps the promise of endurance.\n\nI came here first as a student. The mountains north of the campus grounds reached into me with hooks of granite and did not let go. The school itself had its share of glory in brick and mortar and leaf, each claiming its portion of memory, but the mountains ruled absolute. The town spread below them like a supplicant. Coffee houses where young scholars fought sleep and desperation with bitter drink and darker thoughts. The downtown streets paved in old brick the color of dried blood, restaurants and offices standing shoulder to shoulder like condemned men. Here the quiet town showed its hidden fever, its secret heart beating wild as any city, but this lasted only blocks before the library rose up to restore silence once more. The place lived split between two natures, as if it could not decide what manner of thing it wished to be.\n\nMemories lay scattered across it all like fallen leaves. Some sweet as summer wine, others bitter as ash. The rusted playground where we walked dawn-drunk and sleepless. The gaudy theater where we spent the university's money on dreams projected large as life. But there were darker times too, for such is the way of living. The ponds especially drew me in my despair, watching me weep in the small hours while ducks and turtles went about their business, each knowing its place in the order of things while I wandered lost. Many nights I walked past those waters, past the cookie-cutter houses with their neat yards, until I found myself on the main road. The sun would break then across the palm trees like God's own judgment, and looking up I'd see I'd been walking north all along. And there they stood as they had always stood, those mountains, their peaks cutting into the dawn sky like knives, speaking without voice of persistence, of carrying on. Of enduring.",
            "You wouldnt see it first off. Just houses behind them stores. Not the kind of place folks'd choose to lay their head. But go on past that dead Whole Foods building and them hotels that only fill when summer brings the families back like migrating birds and you'll find life there. Real life. Streets lined with apartment buildings set down like some giant child's blocks abandoned in the dirt. They stand there quiet. Watching.\n\nFirst ones you come to got darkness in em. Bad things happened there. We wont speak on it. But them others beyond, they different. Three buildings standing shoulder to shoulder like brothers in the gray morning light. Cross the way theres that college. Small thing. More like a thought of a college really. Students drift in through them iron gates with their coffee cups steaming. Gates scream on their hinges like dying things while cars stack up behind em. Drivers cursing the morning and the gates and the whole world probably.\n\nRoad ends at another. T-shaped like a crucified thing. Park on one side. Healing place on the other where broken folk go to mend. Got chairs out front. Fan spinning lazy circles in the thick summer air like it's stirring soup. Children tumble in the grass across the way. Rolling and spinning while bees drift drunk between the roadside flowers. Old folks walking dogs eye them skateboard kids like they was looking at something died. Same old folks tip their heads to them girls bunched up by the swing sets talking about boys and whatever comes on them screens they always looking at.\n\nGot this sushi place tucked in with the other shops. Cheap food. Empty most times. Swimming store beside it. Place for painting ladies' nails between em. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your fingers. Eat raw fish. Theres one of them frozen yogurt places too where you put whatever you want on top. Them skateboard kids always there with their cups sweating in the heat while they blow smoke from them electronic cigarettes thinking they something special.\n\nThis neighborhood. This piece of the south. Time dont touch it much. Like God looked down and decided to leave this one piece just as it was. Forgotten maybe. Or saved. Hard to say which.",
            "The houses stood quiet and watchful like old men waiting for death. Some split down the middle like conjoined twins torn asunder yet still sharing flesh and bone and blood. Small yards stretched before them, driveways running alongside like dried up creek beds. Reminders of some American dream that once was. That dream that took hold of folk like a fever and then let go just as quick. But these houses they endure. They call out still. Silent testimonies to what folk once believed.\n\nThe people aint what they was. Yards gone wild and hope stretched thin as spiderweb but automobiles still mark each drive like grave markers. Children play in the streets like there aint no tomorrow and maybe there aint. The school stands ninety years if it stands a day, promising futures it cant deliver while old folk remember what cant be forgotten.\n\nChurches empty as promise. Basketball courts full as sin. Houses different as siblings but carrying the same blood. That market run by them Yemen folk, probably the only Arab blood for miles. Rest is colored folk mostly. Streets wide as salvation where children play their games, scattering like quail when cars pass through.\n\nFolk been here forever or might as well have been. Tell stories about knowing everybody's name and business like some lost testament. Where the karate school stood theres a pharmacy now. Seems fighting aint the fashion no more but pills is eternal. That movie house showing pictures old as sin for pennies. Young folk dont care for it but the old ones do. Cheaper than memory and twice as sweet.\n\nThat expressway passes through like a river of steel and concrete but you cant get to it from here. Young ones wanted an exit once. Old ones said no. Said it would kill what little was left of the town and maybe they was right. They building a new school now. Need something to call themselves by. Something to mark them as their own. Maybe that cyborg with the country voice living in his log cabin. Might as well. Aint nothing pure left in this world anyhow.",
            "The city stretches endless and gray. Buildings rise like ancient monoliths against a pale sky choked with exhaust and promise. Streets wind through concrete canyons where the people move like specters, each to their own purpose, none speaking, none touching. The neighborhoods bleed into one another without ceremony or distinction. Here and there a store front gleams with artificial light, and there are places where men gather to eat or drink or waste away the hours beneath fluorescent suns.\n\nThe old places persist. Orthodox Jews in their black coats move like dark birds through the morning light. Soviet refugees carry their histories in lined faces and tired eyes. Rainbow flags hang limp in windows where the queer folk have carved out their territory. All of them separate but bound together in this maze of steel and stone.\n\nHe remembers being a child here. Running through streets that seemed wider then, playing with the boy next door whose name he can no longer recall. The memory is like ash in his mouth.\n\nFurther out lie the ethnic boroughs. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. Each one a world contained, but it takes hours now to cross even small distances. The cars move like dying things through the arteries of the city, congested and slow. Construction cranes rise everywhere like mechanical prophets, heralding more towers, more people, more machines to clog the streets.\n\nThe houses stand as they always have. Some grand and some humble, duplex and single family alike, but all of them growing smaller beneath the shadows of new apartment blocks that rise like concrete mountains against the sky. The people who live in them are strangers to one another now. They pass without speaking, without seeing, each sealed away in their private worlds.\n\nAt night the parks lie empty save for the occasional mother hurrying her children home. The streets pulse with a desperate energy, headlights cutting through the darkness like searching eyes. Somewhere in all this wasteland there must be meaning, but he cannot find it. The city devours meaning. It consumes purpose. It grinds all things to dust and ash and memory.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn. This is it, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before. Coming from where stores stood within arms reach of home she knew nothing of such emptiness. The fields stretched out before us like some biblical wasteland. Row after row of corn stalks standing dead and mindless in the gray light.\n\nPast the water-filled quarry lay the development where I lived. Houses of brick and stucco rose up from half-acre plots tended with religious devotion. In spring the flowers came. Then the trees would change as they always had and always would until there was nothing left to change at all. Mercedes cars sat in driveways like chrome beasts gleaming in the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived next door. Ancient now but still he pushed his mower across the endless grass singing songs that made no sense to anyone but him. Once he'd been a doctor but that was long ago in some other life. Now he was just part of the landscape like the John Deere he rode. Another ghost in a place full of ghosts.\n\nBehind the house ran the stream that fed the quarry. At night you could hear the bullfrogs and the lowing of cattle from farms unseen. Across a bridge made by hands long dead lay a wilderness untouched by man. This was where I spent my childhood. Building forts in trees that cared nothing for the works of boys. Chasing creatures that had no names.\n\nWinter came like judgment. The yard that was green turned white and empty. Trees that once bloomed pink and purple stood skeletal against the gray sky. Snow fell in the night transforming everything. My sister's angels lay scattered in the yard like the aftermath of some celestial war. We built fortifications of ice and snow, arming ourselves with frozen ammunition, fighting battles that meant nothing and everything all at once. We were children then. We knew nothing of the world or its terrors. We existed in that moment like creatures from some half-remembered dream, pure and innocent, before the darkness came."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This land aint got no towers of glass nor concrete fortresses they call malls. No Walmart. No Target. Just earth and water and sky stretched out like God himself laid it bare. Michigan they call it but that dont capture the truth of it. Two lakes hem us in like ancient sentinels. Lake Michigan to the west, vast and cold and gray, Lake Charlevoix to the east, both of them carrying secrets older than man.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old soldiers who've seen too much to crowd together. Each one different, each one bearing the marks of time and weather and the hands that built them. Basements dug deep into the earth, visible from the road like open wounds in the ground. Aluminum siding gone silver with age, colors faded but holding on, defiant against the elements.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs too, and people on wheels and feet, moving through the days like spirits. Neighbors know neighbors here. You can tell who belongs and who dont. The ground beneath is kept clean and green, no dead leaves left to rot, no grass grown wild. Not beautiful maybe, not like them magazines show, but something more important. Something real.\n\nWithin walking distance stands the sheriff's jail, gray and solemn as a headstone. The health department too, and the place where they sort through what people throw away. Baseball fields where voices cry out names into the evening air, the words carrying across empty spaces like prayers. Small planes growl overhead, metal birds casting shadows on the earth below.\n\nYou can walk to get ice cream here, real ice cream, not that stuff they sell in boxes in them big stores. Downtown aint far neither, if your legs'll carry you. Children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through streets that know their names. This here's a place where people can breathe, where they can live without looking over their shoulder every minute. It aint perfect maybe, but it's got something that them bigger places lost long ago. Something true.\n\nWe're surrounded by water here, like them old tales of paradise. Every which way you turn theres a beach waiting, water lapping at the shore like time itself trying to wear away at the edges of our world. This here's a place where a body can plant their feet and know they're standing on something real. Something that'll hold.",
            "He stood at the entrance to the development watching the sameness stretch out before him like some terrible vision of conformity made manifest in stucco and concrete. The homes stood in their rows, each yard a mirror of the last, grass cut to precise heights as if measured by some godless instrument. Small trees dotted the landscape at measured intervals, their shadows falling on decorative stone that had never known the touch of natural placement.\n\nThe homeowners association ruled here like some faceless authority from an age long past. Their presence hung in the air like a specter, manifest in the pristine driveways and the mechanical precision of every architectural choice. Two-car garages lined the streets like empty eyes staring out at nothing.\n\nThe roads lay perfect and unmarred, as if suffering itself had been outlawed here. No potholes marred the concrete, no imperfection dared show its face. At the end of each street stood clusters of mailboxes, metal sentinels requiring keys like some ritual of belonging. They'd banned the individual boxes, those small totems of personality, in favor of uniformity.\n\nThe neighborhood pressed against the city's edge where civilization met wilderness, though both had been tamed here. Community pools lay behind their gates like blue mirrors reflecting nothing but order. Walking trails wound through the manufactured wild, paths laid down for those seeking the illusion of nature's touch.\n\nThe retired folk who dwelt here kept watch from behind their windows, their presence a kind of sentinel against disorder. Young professionals moved among them like ghosts, all of them bound by invisible covenants to maintain this artificial peace.\n\nBeyond lay the city proper, its mall standing alone like some commercial monument to necessity. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to the stores, those temples of commerce where organic produce lay alongside discount goods in their separate kingdoms of plenty.\n\nHe thought about how they'd tamed even time here, how they'd stripped away the chaos of life and replaced it with something controllable. The sun set over the development the same as it had yesterday and would tomorrow, casting shadows across a place where even darkness had been negotiated into submission.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the missing. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more each month to inhabit. None I knew had heard such tales. Perhaps it's the weight of living pressing down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, the musty clothes and broken toys. The scents of childhood fade. Some take to tobacco, others just forget what clean air tastes like. But the flea market abides. The smell of growing old is magazines yellow with age atop a piano that won't sing no more. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned.\n\nThree thrift stores within walking. Start at the far end and you can work your way through charity shops, the library with its quiet rooms, rare books behind glass, curiosities in dusty cases. Downtown's full up with metal and flesh, morning til night, but in the thrift stores time stops. Silent as a tomb no matter the chaos outside. Good place to lose yourself. More folk coming every year now. Growing city, they say. Some big company dealing in packages and promises set up here. Like New York in its way. Everyone got their own purpose and none asks much of you. Can keep to yourself, quiet-like, and folk leave you be. Not like down South where concern means caring. Here you don't pry and the city rolls past like waves on dark shores.\n\nLife moves through it though. Got a piano player next door, singers up above. Less strangers than a kind of family. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Lucky maybe. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I got it. Carry their mail, they carry mine. Good to see them, think they feel the same. Living in this concrete maze might seem like damnation but these people, these neighbors of mine, make me think I ain't ruined everything just yet.",
            "The town lay just beyond the reach of the city's sprawl, a small heartland place where the east side bore the marks of harder times. Houses stood weathered and wanting, their values low as the winter sun, rented or owned by folk who knew the taste of empty cupboards. Not an ugly place though. Not that. Neighbors would nod and speak their mornings, their faces lined with stories untold.\n\nThe darkness came sometimes. Violence had marked its territory these past years. Gunshots had torn the night air not three blocks from where we slept. The neighbors boy, taken by lead and powder outside some barroom, his mother's tears still fresh in the soil. Our own losses measured smaller - trinkets gone missing from the porch, carried off like birds in the night.\n\nThe poison ran deep here, same as everywhere now. Fentanyl moving like a ghost through the streets, taking souls quick or slow. But there were those who fought it, teaching others how to pull the dying back from that far shore, running centers where the broken could seek mending.\n\nThe school stood like a beacon. My boy, different in his ways, found shelter there among teachers who saw past difference to the child within. No child went hungry inside those walls, breakfast and lunch free as air, no shame in empty pockets. Parents gathered there too, building something larger than themselves.\n\nThe town fathers poured money into the center streets and western reaches, where commerce flowed. Our side stayed forgotten, streets patched like old quilts, parks gone to seed. Some spoke against this but words dried up like rain on hot pavement.\n\nSixteen years we'd made our home here, in this house that weren't worth much but held us safe. The town had worked its way into our bones, become the ground we walked. Couldn't imagine calling anywhere else home now. Some places mark you that way, write themselves into your story until you can't tell where they end and you begin.",
            "The neighborhood perched high like some ancient sentinel, its bones made of history and mortar and the memories of dead men. Seven stories up I dwelled across from where the theater stood weathered and old, its marquee dark and peeling like the shed skin of something once alive. Down the hill there was a place where folk gathered when the nights grew warm, lined up like cattle waiting for slaughter but there wasnt any slaughter just games and drink and the crush of bodies seeking respite from the world outside.\n\nThe park lay a few blocks distant. Concrete wrapped round it like a noose, steps carved into its throat where the homeless made their camp in the wet season. They lined their tents in rows neat as headstones, huddled together against the rain that fell eternal in these parts. No snow came but the damp got in your bones just the same. They stayed close to where they could wash, where they could remember what it was to be human.\n\nThis place they called Hilltop had been blood ground once. Gang territory. Even now stories passed like scripture of federal men come to sweep clean what could never be cleaned. The people remembered. They always remembered. Tales passed down like family bibles, mother to child, stranger to stranger, about days when death walked these streets wearing colors and carrying steel.\n\nThey said whites shouldnt walk here after dark but that was old fear talking, ghosts of dead prejudice haunting these hills. Maybe it was my skin being just dark enough or maybe the Hill knew its own, knew who understood the weight of history and the stain of ignorance that still marked this supposed paradise of cultures mixed and mingled.\n\nThe streets knew me and I knew them. Id seen kindness here in the dark places where none should exist. Laundry women whod keep their doors open just a minute longer, strangers whod offer warmth against the cold. Id huddled invisible against storefronts in the gray nothing of night only to be seen, truly seen, by some passing soul whod press paper money in my hand and speak of worth and beauty like a prayer.\n\nThe Hill was home. Nothing else to it. Just home.",
            "I came here in the eighth grade of my youth, to a place that would shape the years ahead. The houses stood like sentinels, two stories tall, identical and watchful in their suburban uniformity. At first the loneliness was a thing that lived inside me but then there were two boys, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, though they're gone now, scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. But the memory of them remains, etched in the concrete and the quiet afternoons.\n\nThe neighborhood stands unchanged. Silent most days save for the sound of children's voices carrying on the warm air, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. The people here keep to themselves except in times of need, like creatures in a desert waiting for the rain. Trust lives here still. Packages appear and remain untouched on porches like offerings to some domestic god.\n\nThere's a park nearby, not more than a whisper away. The basketball court and the baseball diamond and the football field where blood once flowed from my nose after an elbow caught me wrong, the memory of it sharp and metallic like a copper penny on the tongue. Now I take my cousin's children there, watch them swing and slide in the dying light of day, their joy pure and uncontaminated by time. The park holds ghosts now, memories that drift through the chain link fences like ash on the wind.\n\nThe streets around us pulse with life and food from every corner of the world. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All of it brought to doors now by young men and women carrying plastic bags like modern day deliverers of sustenance. Fast food joints squat on corners like concrete toads, their neon signs bleeding into the night. The stores stand shoulder to shoulder offering everything a body might need. Walgreens. CVS. The Jewel-Osco where the midwest does its marketing. Even an Indian store where spices sit in glass jars like captured sunsets.\n\nI've seen the stories of neighborhood wars fought on glowing screens and heard tales of feuds that burn like eternal flames, and I know that what we have here is rare as gold and twice as precious. This place, these streets, these people - they are a tapestry woven of peace and quiet understanding. And in these times that's a thing worth holding onto with both hands.",
            "The college stands near where I live, close enough to walk. Apartment buildings rise up like dead sentinels, their windows dark and watching. Between them stand the bars and eating houses where students gather, spending what little money they have on watered drinks and microwaved sustenance. They renamed one of the bars recent. More costly now but the spirits flow just the same.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes. Students with their books and dreams and the poor folk who've always been here, dwelling in the cheap rooms above. Children too, many of them, drawn by the elementary school that squats behind chain link nearby. My neighbors I do not know. Would not want to. The sweet reek of their smoking seeps beneath doors while management fights a futile war with artificial freshness pumped through vents.\n\nOld buildings crowd together, their facades weathered and peeling like dead skin though some hide renewed interiors behind their decay. Down the road stand newer structures, false promises of luxury built quick and cheap, charging gold prices for cardboard walls. They know the students will come regardless. The restaurant across serves food on paper, everything heated in boxes that hum. The gas station beside it bears witness to tired workers moving through their days like ghosts.\n\nThe city put money in once. New concrete paths snake between fresh-planted grass but cannot hide what lies beneath. Trees crowd thick around my building, their brothers cut down to stumps that dot the earth like grave markers. Behind us lies 43rd Street, meaner than ours, its walkways broken and buildings lurking behind vegetation gone wild. Violence lives there sometimes, though it visits our side too, carried on night winds between the complexes.\n\nBut I stay. The price is right and the buses come regular, metal beetles carrying us to market and downtown. The university waits within walking distance, promising something better. Or at least different. Sometimes that's enough.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass before the drought takes it. They'd built them to look separate but they aint. Folk gather some evenings at the end of whatever drive suits them best, watching their young ones mark the concrete with colored chalk or send their kites up into whatever wind God provides. Like stepping back through time itself, he thought. A respite from the cold mechanical world that had taken hold of everything else.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up against skies so blue they hurt to look at. But the weather turns cruel sometimes. Last night the sirens came wailing through the darkness, their sound carrying death in it. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever treasures seemed worth saving while the big one paced the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. Hail came down like God's own judgment, covering the ground in white fury. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing its last, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five quick as a heart stops beating. The hail disappeared into the hot pavement like it never was. Then the sun broke through and the rain came with it, and there in the sky hung two rainbows like some ancient sign.\n\nNeighbors emerged slow and cautious from wherever they'd took shelter, and soon enough the mothers was back out watching their young ones while supper cooked inside. Strange music in their southern voices, different from the northern sounds I'd known before. The houses might look alike outside but inside they're as different as the souls that inhabit them. Some small as prison cells, some opening up like churches.\n\nBehind it all lies the big field and the pond where swimming aint allowed. Deer move through there like ghosts at dawn and dusk. The bullfrogs sing their morning prayers and roosters call from the surrounding farms like preachers calling sinners to worship. A donkey brays in the evening darkness, reminding us all that we aint alone in this world. Found this place like finding gold in river mud, forty minutes from the city but might as well be forty years from anywhere.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Time stretches long like a black road with no end. When we first come here from Riverdale to Stockbridge my eyes ran wet with salt and grief for them I'd left behind. Mama and daddy they wanted better for us. For me and the little sister both. Said the schools was better here. Said it wasnt like them other places where the devil's work gets done in broad daylight.\n\nYears pass like dead leaves in the wind. Made some friends. Made some enemies too. Didnt know many neighbors except old Glen and Dennis living right alongside us. Good people. Like blood kin almost. I member that time Glen got hitched again. The whole family went. Mama daddy sister and me. White dress and cake and dancing. That woman Veda she threw that white thing off her leg and somehow it found its way to my hands like it knew where to land. Didnt catch them flowers though. Danced with Marsharii that night. Aint seen her since. Sometimes I wonder where the wind carried her.\n\nThis place is like them old mazes where you cant see the way out. Got me one of them GPS things now though. Started exploring with Kason and Curtis. We was always playing them video games. Living like there wasnt no tomorrow. Sometimes I go down to that park. Something about it soothes what needs soothing inside. Take them sticks from the hardware store. Practice my balance like them old monks might've done. Sometimes bring my wooden sword too. Basketball court sits empty most days. Tennis court too. Daddy and Mr Graves taught us tennis when we was young. Worked us till we could hardly stand but we smiled through it all.\n\nReckon I've lived enough stories in this place to fill a book. But them memories I told about, they stick like burrs to wool. Sometimes I look out past the houses and trees and think maybe the best aint happened yet. Maybe it's out there waiting like a promise. Like something written in stone before the world was born.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, nestled in the heart of South Carolina where the peach trees stood sentinel over the land. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World emblazoned on a weathered sign that greeted those few who passed through. Fields stretched out beyond sight, dotted with cattle and orchards that had been there longer than any living soul could reckon.\n\nThe houses stood apart from one another like strangers at a wake. Metal roofs gleaming in the merciless summer sun, or gray shingles dulled by time and weather. Set back from the road they were, behind fields where beasts grazed and crops rose from the earth like prayers.\n\nIn the heart of it all hung a single stoplight, swaying gentle above a fourway crossing where what passed for commerce gathered. Hong Kong, run by a family whose story was written in their eyes. Fiesta. Gary's with its burgers. The pizzeria gone now, nothing but an empty shell and memories of better days. Maxwell and Halford's where they sold cherry cola that tasted like childhood. IGA where folk bought what they needed but not what they wanted, saving their dollars for the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, that concrete cathedral of commerce.\n\nDollar General stood like a beacon, drawing them in from sunup to sundown. Possibilities Furniture where a woman known to all sold pieces that would outlive their owners. Clark's where they tended to the animals. Doctor's office and veterinary both, small but necessary as breath itself.\n\nThe school stood alone, Johnston Elementary, sending its children away after fifth grade like young birds pushed from the nest. No parks yet, though they spoke of one. Two and a half acres of promise that might never come to pass.\n\nNo picture shows or bowling alleys or places where youth might gather. No grounds for walking dogs or sitting in the shade. Just the land and the peach trees and the cattle and the people who called it home. Small enough to miss in the blink of an eye, like a tear shed for something beautiful and forgotten.",
            "The street runs between two highways, a vein of asphalt carrying the lifeblood of commerce and strangers through what might otherwise be sanctuary. We abide here, my wife and daughters and I, watching from our corner perch like sentinels of some forgotten outpost. The girls are eleven and fourteen, still young enough to find wonder in the rain.\n\nThe neighborhood holds its own against time. Few move in, fewer leave. Each house keeps its stories close, yards tended with quiet dedication, the drone of mowers marking time from March till October when the grass finally yields to winter's approach. Ancient trees tower above, remnants of what was here before, their shadows stretching across lawns like dark fingers. Come autumn they shed their burden and the air fills with smoke from leaf fires, that ancient perfume of seasons changing.\n\nWe work from home, our house both shelter and prison, watching the parade of familiar vehicles pass. Any strange car draws eyes like a wolf among sheep. Children pedal their bikes in endless circles, dogs walk their masters in morning mist, and the whole world seems to turn on its own axis, separate from the chaos beyond our borders.\n\nThe garage stands sentinel at the back, its doors like eyes when opened, watching over the street where I work on my truck, hands black with grease and mind empty of everything save the task. The front door stays shut, unused, a relic of formality. Holidays bring strange cars and distant kin, metal and flesh both gleaming with newness, but they pass like storms, leaving the street to its own devices.\n\nWinter comes seldom now, as if the seasons themselves have lost their way. Autumn stretches endless, the trees holding their leaves longer each year, the sleds on our hill gathering dust. Were it not for the constant flow of traffic, this place might be perfect. But perfection died with the old world, and we make do with what remains.",
            "The land stretches out brown and endless, dirt upon dirt and more dirt still, like some biblical curse laid down in ancient times. They dont know, them that aint lived here, what it means to wake each morning to that vast brownness spreading out in all directions, how a patch of green lawn marks a man who'd empty his wallet just to see something grow. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart like sentinels in the waste but now they crowd closer, though still with space between like they fear touching. The city grows like some slow cancer eating at the edges of the desert but that's the way of all places now.\n\nGood folk and bad folk both walk these streets same as anywhere. Round my place its mostly old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind screen doors. The stores aint nothing special, just them chain places with their bright signs and empty promises. No fancy markets here. You want that kind of thing youll need to drive and drive far.\n\nThe builders they come like vultures to fresh kill. They see all this empty space and their eyes get bright with the possibilities of profit. Sometimes watching them I get a sick feeling deep in my gut knowing they'll fill it all someday. Left the big city to get away from all that. Now I work construction myself, hanging drywall and ceiling grids, watching the desert disappear one room at a time.\n\nBut the animals. They was here first and they stay on, living in the spaces between. Folk come here for different reasons but mainly for that stark terrible beauty of it all. The desert, she makes her own rules about what lives and what dies. The wildlife, they know these rules better than any man. My younguns, they spend their days chasing lizards and insects like some primitive hunters, learning the ways of this hard land same as the creatures they pursue.\n\nWe got our attractions sure enough. The county fair comes round once a year like some traveling carnival of normalcy. Folks can drive up to Wrightwood, see the snow on the mountains like God's own frosting. The museum stands testament to what was here before - bones and artifacts and remnants of peoples long gone to dust. But its the desert herself that holds the real story, written in sand and stone and the long silence of empty places.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland. Buildings old and gray rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. He reckons it different from what others might call neighborhood but it is his and he knows no other. The dormitory stands sentinel among lesser structures, its windows dark and watching. Within dwell the others. His people. His community such as it is.\n\nThree kinds of dwelling here in this stone and metal maze. The apartments first, stacked boxes of glass and steel where souls cluster two and four to a room, twenty or more to a building, all of them pressed together in their shared solitude. Then the houses proper, scattered few among the grounds like artifacts of some forgotten domestic age. Alumni dwelling there in twos and fours, hanging on to what was. Last the dormitories themselves. Great concrete hives where hundreds sleep and wake and dream their dreams of what's to come. Two to a cell mostly. Steel beds. Institutional walls. The fluorescent light falling cold and dead across empty halls at night.\n\nThey come from everywhere, these people. All colors, all tongues. The professional staff in their little houses at the margins, new students in the great concrete dormitories, the older ones in their apartment warrens. No words could capture the whole of them. Better to let them be what they are.\n\nThe stores stand in rows like tired soldiers. Places to eat, places to buy whatever they need to survive here in this manufactured world. A park too, though calling it that seems wrong somehow. Just a space they keep clean between the buildings where sometimes they gather, these disparate souls all thrown together in this place that is neither city nor town but something else entirely. Something unnamed.\n\nHe looks out across it all in the failing light. The buildings rising dark against the sky. The paths between them empty now save for a few wandering figures, their shadows long and thin in the evening sun. This is his neighborhood. His world. For better or worse, this is where he dwells.",
            "The road runs empty where I live, winding up past houses perched like watchful birds on the highest ground any man might find to build upon. No sidewalks here. Just broken asphalt and the long slope rising cruel and merciless before you, a thing joggers seek out in their endless circling of these streets. They come and go like wraiths in the morning fog. The power lines hang loose and patched, victims of countless storms that sweep in off the water bringing rain and destruction and leaving behind only silence and the sound of dripping eaves.\n\nThe evergreens stand dark against the sky but they wont stand long. Men here hate them with a hatred pure and cold as winter. They fall to saws and axes, their stumps pulled from the earth like rotting teeth to clear the view of water beyond. Houses rise up proud and gleaming with their walls of glass, each trying to outreach the other in their hunger for the bay below. When the sun sets the water burns orange and gold but most days theres nothing but gray. Gray sky. Gray water. Gray mist that shrouds it all in a veil thick as grief.\n\nThe moss claims everything here. It grows wild and unchecked, turning cars and rooftops into fuzzy green monuments to decay. Left my own vehicle sitting idle once and found it transformed, had to scrape three hours to find metal underneath all that green fur.\n\nNo children here to speak of though theres a school close by. Just old folk watching their days wind down slow as the tide. Dogs run loose and fearless, pushing through open doors like they own them. Found one in my living room once, staring at me with eyes that held no apology. The rabbits too have claimed this place for their own, great fat things that dig up gardens until the cats hunt them down. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds mostly, though sometimes a hawk or eagle cuts through the air until the crows drive it off with their black wings beating like war drums.\n\nDown by the water where the restaurants serve up whatever the sea gives them that day, theres nothing but rocks and more rocks. The bay sits narrow and still, the far shore always visible through the mist like some half-remembered dream of solid ground.",
            "Bensonhurst lay before him like some vast concrete labyrinth, a maze of weathered brownstone and tired brick stretching toward a colorless sky. The trains came and went like metal serpents, their bellies full of the restless souls who'd made this corner of Brooklyn their temporary hell or heaven. He'd seen it change, seen the old Italian facades give way to signs in languages he couldn't read, their characters strange and beautiful like some ancient calligraphy.\n\nThe Asians had come slowly at first then all at once, like water through a broken dam. Their stores stood now on every corner, bright and clean and foreign. Markets full of fruits he'd never known existed, their flesh strange and wonderful. Laundromats humming their endless cycles, steam rising like ghosts in the fluorescent light. The old residents watched it happen and said nothing, for the food was good and the prices fair and what more could a man want in these godless times.\n\nHe walked past four markets within two minutes, each one a mirror of the last, each one full of voices speaking in tongues he'd never learn. The neighborhood was a babel of sorts, generations of immigrants layered like geological strata, their children speaking in tongues both old and new.\n\nThe park stood renewed, a concrete paradise where children played at being children. Basketball courts stretched like a graveyard of dreams, the thump of rubber on asphalt a heartbeat in the urban silence. Water fountains sprayed their blessing in summer, baptizing the young ones who shrieked and ran through the artificial rain.\n\nAt night the streets changed their nature. Music thundered from passing cars like war drums, engines roared their defiance at the darkness. The weak were prey here, as they had always been. He remembered the fists, the hatred in strange eyes, the theft of small things left unguarded. Even the dogs left their mark, their waste like small brown monuments to man's indifference.\n\nHe watched it all from his window, this theater of humanity playing out its endless acts. The houses stood shoulder to shoulder like weary soldiers, two families to each, all of them dreaming their separate dreams of better days. This was Bensonhurst, neither heaven nor hell but somewhere in between, where the trains ran on time and the markets never closed and the night was full of sounds that might have been music or might have been screams.",
            "You got to understand what weird means in Portland Oregon. Aint no simple thing. Words painted up on some building downtown that serves pizza and liquor and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws nobody seems to mind about. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk remember the old days when the city was cheaper and stranger and filled with its own particular madness. Others come seeking sanctuary for their own peculiarities, drawn like moths to the dim glow of acceptance.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their ways. Steel and glass boxes rise up to house them but the weird persists like some stubborn weed in concrete. Aint the same as acceptance mind you. The weird just means we take in what others cast out. We got our modern contraptions same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere. Normal folk doing normal things but somehow less burdened by it all.\n\nIn my quarter of the city the houses stand painted in colors that'd shame a sunset. Gardens growing wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers pushing up through cracks in the earth like memories of some forgotten paradise. And there's them free boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass by. Books and clothes mainly but could be anything. Magic in them boxes. Real magic sometimes, if you believe in such things.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray and constant like God's own melancholy. Drives some folk to darkness, to needles and bottles and sleeping rough under bridges. City tries to help but help aint never enough. The ones with homes look on them that aint got none with mixed hearts. Love and hate wrestling in their chests like brother killing brother.\n\nSome folk do their goat yoga. Some wave flags for the soccer boys. Some dig through boxes on sidewalks looking for treasure. All of us weird in our own particular way, carrying our dreams like crosses, drowning them in beer when they get too heavy. Aint so different from anywhere else in that regard. Just less ashamed of it maybe. Less inclined to hide what we are.\n\nThe weird persists. Like cockroaches after fire. Like hope in a dead world. Like love in a heart turned to stone.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel. North they rise like ancient gods bearing witness to the coming and going of light, to the passing of all things mortal and fleeting. A man might forget them in the crush and grind of his days but they remain, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of flesh and bone. And when the weight of living bears down heavy as stone they command attention with their jagged truth, offering up some measure of strength to the weary soul that looks upon them. Not peace exactly but perhaps the promise of endurance.\n\nI came here first as a student. The mountains north of the campus grounds reached into me with hooks of granite and did not let go. The school itself had its share of glory in brick and mortar and leaf, each claiming its portion of memory, but the mountains ruled absolute. The town spread below them like a supplicant. Coffee houses where young scholars fought sleep and desperation with bitter drink and darker thoughts. The downtown streets paved in old brick the color of dried blood, restaurants and offices standing shoulder to shoulder like condemned men. Here the quiet town showed its hidden fever, its secret heart beating wild as any city, but this lasted only blocks before the library rose up to restore silence once more. The place lived split between two natures, as if it could not decide what manner of thing it wished to be.\n\nMemories lay scattered across it all like fallen leaves. Some sweet as summer wine, others bitter as ash. The rusted playground where we walked dawn-drunk and sleepless. The gaudy theater where we spent the university's money on dreams projected large as life. But there were darker times too, for such is the way of living. The ponds especially drew me in my despair, watching me weep in the small hours while ducks and turtles went about their business, each knowing its place in the order of things while I wandered lost. Many nights I walked past those waters, past the cookie-cutter houses with their neat yards, until I found myself on the main road. The sun would break then across the palm trees like God's own judgment, and looking up I'd see I'd been walking north all along. And there they stood as they had always stood, those mountains, their peaks cutting into the dawn sky like knives, speaking without voice of persistence, of carrying on. Of enduring.",
            "You wouldnt see it first off. Just houses behind them stores. Not the kind of place folks'd choose to lay their head. But go on past that dead Whole Foods building and them hotels that only fill when summer brings the families back like migrating birds and you'll find life there. Real life. Streets lined with apartment buildings set down like some giant child's blocks abandoned in the dirt. They stand there quiet. Watching.\n\nFirst ones you come to got darkness in em. Bad things happened there. We wont speak on it. But them others beyond, they different. Three buildings standing shoulder to shoulder like brothers in the gray morning light. Cross the way theres that college. Small thing. More like a thought of a college really. Students drift in through them iron gates with their coffee cups steaming. Gates scream on their hinges like dying things while cars stack up behind em. Drivers cursing the morning and the gates and the whole world probably.\n\nRoad ends at another. T-shaped like a crucified thing. Park on one side. Healing place on the other where broken folk go to mend. Got chairs out front. Fan spinning lazy circles in the thick summer air like it's stirring soup. Children tumble in the grass across the way. Rolling and spinning while bees drift drunk between the roadside flowers. Old folks walking dogs eye them skateboard kids like they was looking at something died. Same old folks tip their heads to them girls bunched up by the swing sets talking about boys and whatever comes on them screens they always looking at.\n\nGot this sushi place tucked in with the other shops. Cheap food. Empty most times. Swimming store beside it. Place for painting ladies' nails between em. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your fingers. Eat raw fish. Theres one of them frozen yogurt places too where you put whatever you want on top. Them skateboard kids always there with their cups sweating in the heat while they blow smoke from them electronic cigarettes thinking they something special.\n\nThis neighborhood. This piece of the south. Time dont touch it much. Like God looked down and decided to leave this one piece just as it was. Forgotten maybe. Or saved. Hard to say which.",
            "The houses stood quiet and watchful like old men waiting for death. Some split down the middle like conjoined twins torn asunder yet still sharing flesh and bone and blood. Small yards stretched before them, driveways running alongside like dried up creek beds. Reminders of some American dream that once was. That dream that took hold of folk like a fever and then let go just as quick. But these houses they endure. They call out still. Silent testimonies to what folk once believed.\n\nThe people aint what they was. Yards gone wild and hope stretched thin as spiderweb but automobiles still mark each drive like grave markers. Children play in the streets like there aint no tomorrow and maybe there aint. The school stands ninety years if it stands a day, promising futures it cant deliver while old folk remember what cant be forgotten.\n\nChurches empty as promise. Basketball courts full as sin. Houses different as siblings but carrying the same blood. That market run by them Yemen folk, probably the only Arab blood for miles. Rest is colored folk mostly. Streets wide as salvation where children play their games, scattering like quail when cars pass through.\n\nFolk been here forever or might as well have been. Tell stories about knowing everybody's name and business like some lost testament. Where the karate school stood theres a pharmacy now. Seems fighting aint the fashion no more but pills is eternal. That movie house showing pictures old as sin for pennies. Young folk dont care for it but the old ones do. Cheaper than memory and twice as sweet.\n\nThat expressway passes through like a river of steel and concrete but you cant get to it from here. Young ones wanted an exit once. Old ones said no. Said it would kill what little was left of the town and maybe they was right. They building a new school now. Need something to call themselves by. Something to mark them as their own. Maybe that cyborg with the country voice living in his log cabin. Might as well. Aint nothing pure left in this world anyhow.",
            "The city stretches endless and gray. Buildings rise like ancient monoliths against a pale sky choked with exhaust and promise. Streets wind through concrete canyons where the people move like specters, each to their own purpose, none speaking, none touching. The neighborhoods bleed into one another without ceremony or distinction. Here and there a store front gleams with artificial light, and there are places where men gather to eat or drink or waste away the hours beneath fluorescent suns.\n\nThe old places persist. Orthodox Jews in their black coats move like dark birds through the morning light. Soviet refugees carry their histories in lined faces and tired eyes. Rainbow flags hang limp in windows where the queer folk have carved out their territory. All of them separate but bound together in this maze of steel and stone.\n\nHe remembers being a child here. Running through streets that seemed wider then, playing with the boy next door whose name he can no longer recall. The memory is like ash in his mouth.\n\nFurther out lie the ethnic boroughs. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. Each one a world contained, but it takes hours now to cross even small distances. The cars move like dying things through the arteries of the city, congested and slow. Construction cranes rise everywhere like mechanical prophets, heralding more towers, more people, more machines to clog the streets.\n\nThe houses stand as they always have. Some grand and some humble, duplex and single family alike, but all of them growing smaller beneath the shadows of new apartment blocks that rise like concrete mountains against the sky. The people who live in them are strangers to one another now. They pass without speaking, without seeing, each sealed away in their private worlds.\n\nAt night the parks lie empty save for the occasional mother hurrying her children home. The streets pulse with a desperate energy, headlights cutting through the darkness like searching eyes. Somewhere in all this wasteland there must be meaning, but he cannot find it. The city devours meaning. It consumes purpose. It grinds all things to dust and ash and memory.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn. This is it, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before. Coming from where stores stood within arms reach of home she knew nothing of such emptiness. The fields stretched out before us like some biblical wasteland. Row after row of corn stalks standing dead and mindless in the gray light.\n\nPast the water-filled quarry lay the development where I lived. Houses of brick and stucco rose up from half-acre plots tended with religious devotion. In spring the flowers came. Then the trees would change as they always had and always would until there was nothing left to change at all. Mercedes cars sat in driveways like chrome beasts gleaming in the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived next door. Ancient now but still he pushed his mower across the endless grass singing songs that made no sense to anyone but him. Once he'd been a doctor but that was long ago in some other life. Now he was just part of the landscape like the John Deere he rode. Another ghost in a place full of ghosts.\n\nBehind the house ran the stream that fed the quarry. At night you could hear the bullfrogs and the lowing of cattle from farms unseen. Across a bridge made by hands long dead lay a wilderness untouched by man. This was where I spent my childhood. Building forts in trees that cared nothing for the works of boys. Chasing creatures that had no names.\n\nWinter came like judgment. The yard that was green turned white and empty. Trees that once bloomed pink and purple stood skeletal against the gray sky. Snow fell in the night transforming everything. My sister's angels lay scattered in the yard like the aftermath of some celestial war. We built fortifications of ice and snow, arming ourselves with frozen ammunition, fighting battles that meant nothing and everything all at once. We were children then. We knew nothing of the world or its terrors. We existed in that moment like creatures from some half-remembered dream, pure and innocent, before the darkness came."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This land aint got no towers of glass nor concrete fortresses they call malls. No Walmart. No Target. Just earth and water and sky stretched out like God himself laid it bare. Michigan they call it but that dont capture the truth of it. Two lakes hem us in like ancient sentinels. Lake Michigan to the west, vast and cold and gray, Lake Charlevoix to the east, both of them carrying secrets older than man.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old soldiers who've seen too much to crowd together. Each one different, each one bearing the marks of time and weather and the hands that built them. Basements dug deep into the earth, visible from the road like open wounds in the ground. Aluminum siding gone silver with age, colors faded but holding on, defiant against the elements.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs too, and people on wheels and feet, moving through the days like spirits. Neighbors know neighbors here. You can tell who belongs and who dont. The ground beneath is kept clean and green, no dead leaves left to rot, no grass grown wild. Not beautiful maybe, not like them magazines show, but something more important. Something real.\n\nWithin walking distance stands the sheriff's jail, gray and solemn as a headstone. The health department too, and the place where they sort through what people throw away. Baseball fields where voices cry out names into the evening air, the words carrying across empty spaces like prayers. Small planes growl overhead, metal birds casting shadows on the earth below.\n\nYou can walk to get ice cream here, real ice cream, not that stuff they sell in boxes in them big stores. Downtown aint far neither, if your legs'll carry you. Children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through streets that know their names. This here's a place where people can breathe, where they can live without looking over their shoulder every minute. It aint perfect maybe, but it's got something that them bigger places lost long ago. Something true.\n\nWe're surrounded by water here, like them old tales of paradise. Every which way you turn theres a beach waiting, water lapping at the shore like time itself trying to wear away at the edges of our world. This here's a place where a body can plant their feet and know they're standing on something real. Something that'll hold.",
            "He stood at the entrance to the development watching the sameness stretch out before him like some terrible vision of conformity made manifest in stucco and concrete. The homes stood in their rows, each yard a mirror of the last, grass cut to precise heights as if measured by some godless instrument. Small trees dotted the landscape at measured intervals, their shadows falling on decorative stone that had never known the touch of natural placement.\n\nThe homeowners association ruled here like some faceless authority from an age long past. Their presence hung in the air like a specter, manifest in the pristine driveways and the mechanical precision of every architectural choice. Two-car garages lined the streets like empty eyes staring out at nothing.\n\nThe roads lay perfect and unmarred, as if suffering itself had been outlawed here. No potholes marred the concrete, no imperfection dared show its face. At the end of each street stood clusters of mailboxes, metal sentinels requiring keys like some ritual of belonging. They'd banned the individual boxes, those small totems of personality, in favor of uniformity.\n\nThe neighborhood pressed against the city's edge where civilization met wilderness, though both had been tamed here. Community pools lay behind their gates like blue mirrors reflecting nothing but order. Walking trails wound through the manufactured wild, paths laid down for those seeking the illusion of nature's touch.\n\nThe retired folk who dwelt here kept watch from behind their windows, their presence a kind of sentinel against disorder. Young professionals moved among them like ghosts, all of them bound by invisible covenants to maintain this artificial peace.\n\nBeyond lay the city proper, its mall standing alone like some commercial monument to necessity. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to the stores, those temples of commerce where organic produce lay alongside discount goods in their separate kingdoms of plenty.\n\nHe thought about how they'd tamed even time here, how they'd stripped away the chaos of life and replaced it with something controllable. The sun set over the development the same as it had yesterday and would tomorrow, casting shadows across a place where even darkness had been negotiated into submission.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the missing. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more each month to inhabit. None I knew had heard such tales. Perhaps it's the weight of living pressing down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, the musty clothes and broken toys. The scents of childhood fade. Some take to tobacco, others just forget what clean air tastes like. But the flea market abides. The smell of growing old is magazines yellow with age atop a piano that won't sing no more. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned.\n\nThree thrift stores within walking. Start at the far end and you can work your way through charity shops, the library with its quiet rooms, rare books behind glass, curiosities in dusty cases. Downtown's full up with metal and flesh, morning til night, but in the thrift stores time stops. Silent as a tomb no matter the chaos outside. Good place to lose yourself. More folk coming every year now. Growing city, they say. Some big company dealing in packages and promises set up here. Like New York in its way. Everyone got their own purpose and none asks much of you. Can keep to yourself, quiet-like, and folk leave you be. Not like down South where concern means caring. Here you don't pry and the city rolls past like waves on dark shores.\n\nLife moves through it though. Got a piano player next door, singers up above. Less strangers than a kind of family. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Lucky maybe. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I got it. Carry their mail, they carry mine. Good to see them, think they feel the same. Living in this concrete maze might seem like damnation but these people, these neighbors of mine, make me think I ain't ruined everything just yet.",
            "The town lay just beyond the reach of the city's sprawl, a small heartland place where the east side bore the marks of harder times. Houses stood weathered and wanting, their values low as the winter sun, rented or owned by folk who knew the taste of empty cupboards. Not an ugly place though. Not that. Neighbors would nod and speak their mornings, their faces lined with stories untold.\n\nThe darkness came sometimes. Violence had marked its territory these past years. Gunshots had torn the night air not three blocks from where we slept. The neighbors boy, taken by lead and powder outside some barroom, his mother's tears still fresh in the soil. Our own losses measured smaller - trinkets gone missing from the porch, carried off like birds in the night.\n\nThe poison ran deep here, same as everywhere now. Fentanyl moving like a ghost through the streets, taking souls quick or slow. But there were those who fought it, teaching others how to pull the dying back from that far shore, running centers where the broken could seek mending.\n\nThe school stood like a beacon. My boy, different in his ways, found shelter there among teachers who saw past difference to the child within. No child went hungry inside those walls, breakfast and lunch free as air, no shame in empty pockets. Parents gathered there too, building something larger than themselves.\n\nThe town fathers poured money into the center streets and western reaches, where commerce flowed. Our side stayed forgotten, streets patched like old quilts, parks gone to seed. Some spoke against this but words dried up like rain on hot pavement.\n\nSixteen years we'd made our home here, in this house that weren't worth much but held us safe. The town had worked its way into our bones, become the ground we walked. Couldn't imagine calling anywhere else home now. Some places mark you that way, write themselves into your story until you can't tell where they end and you begin.",
            "The neighborhood perched high like some ancient sentinel, its bones made of history and mortar and the memories of dead men. Seven stories up I dwelled across from where the theater stood weathered and old, its marquee dark and peeling like the shed skin of something once alive. Down the hill there was a place where folk gathered when the nights grew warm, lined up like cattle waiting for slaughter but there wasnt any slaughter just games and drink and the crush of bodies seeking respite from the world outside.\n\nThe park lay a few blocks distant. Concrete wrapped round it like a noose, steps carved into its throat where the homeless made their camp in the wet season. They lined their tents in rows neat as headstones, huddled together against the rain that fell eternal in these parts. No snow came but the damp got in your bones just the same. They stayed close to where they could wash, where they could remember what it was to be human.\n\nThis place they called Hilltop had been blood ground once. Gang territory. Even now stories passed like scripture of federal men come to sweep clean what could never be cleaned. The people remembered. They always remembered. Tales passed down like family bibles, mother to child, stranger to stranger, about days when death walked these streets wearing colors and carrying steel.\n\nThey said whites shouldnt walk here after dark but that was old fear talking, ghosts of dead prejudice haunting these hills. Maybe it was my skin being just dark enough or maybe the Hill knew its own, knew who understood the weight of history and the stain of ignorance that still marked this supposed paradise of cultures mixed and mingled.\n\nThe streets knew me and I knew them. Id seen kindness here in the dark places where none should exist. Laundry women whod keep their doors open just a minute longer, strangers whod offer warmth against the cold. Id huddled invisible against storefronts in the gray nothing of night only to be seen, truly seen, by some passing soul whod press paper money in my hand and speak of worth and beauty like a prayer.\n\nThe Hill was home. Nothing else to it. Just home.",
            "I came here in the eighth grade of my youth, to a place that would shape the years ahead. The houses stood like sentinels, two stories tall, identical and watchful in their suburban uniformity. At first the loneliness was a thing that lived inside me but then there were two boys, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, though they're gone now, scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. But the memory of them remains, etched in the concrete and the quiet afternoons.\n\nThe neighborhood stands unchanged. Silent most days save for the sound of children's voices carrying on the warm air, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. The people here keep to themselves except in times of need, like creatures in a desert waiting for the rain. Trust lives here still. Packages appear and remain untouched on porches like offerings to some domestic god.\n\nThere's a park nearby, not more than a whisper away. The basketball court and the baseball diamond and the football field where blood once flowed from my nose after an elbow caught me wrong, the memory of it sharp and metallic like a copper penny on the tongue. Now I take my cousin's children there, watch them swing and slide in the dying light of day, their joy pure and uncontaminated by time. The park holds ghosts now, memories that drift through the chain link fences like ash on the wind.\n\nThe streets around us pulse with life and food from every corner of the world. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All of it brought to doors now by young men and women carrying plastic bags like modern day deliverers of sustenance. Fast food joints squat on corners like concrete toads, their neon signs bleeding into the night. The stores stand shoulder to shoulder offering everything a body might need. Walgreens. CVS. The Jewel-Osco where the midwest does its marketing. Even an Indian store where spices sit in glass jars like captured sunsets.\n\nI've seen the stories of neighborhood wars fought on glowing screens and heard tales of feuds that burn like eternal flames, and I know that what we have here is rare as gold and twice as precious. This place, these streets, these people - they are a tapestry woven of peace and quiet understanding. And in these times that's a thing worth holding onto with both hands.",
            "The college stands near where I live, close enough to walk. Apartment buildings rise up like dead sentinels, their windows dark and watching. Between them stand the bars and eating houses where students gather, spending what little money they have on watered drinks and microwaved sustenance. They renamed one of the bars recent. More costly now but the spirits flow just the same.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes. Students with their books and dreams and the poor folk who've always been here, dwelling in the cheap rooms above. Children too, many of them, drawn by the elementary school that squats behind chain link nearby. My neighbors I do not know. Would not want to. The sweet reek of their smoking seeps beneath doors while management fights a futile war with artificial freshness pumped through vents.\n\nOld buildings crowd together, their facades weathered and peeling like dead skin though some hide renewed interiors behind their decay. Down the road stand newer structures, false promises of luxury built quick and cheap, charging gold prices for cardboard walls. They know the students will come regardless. The restaurant across serves food on paper, everything heated in boxes that hum. The gas station beside it bears witness to tired workers moving through their days like ghosts.\n\nThe city put money in once. New concrete paths snake between fresh-planted grass but cannot hide what lies beneath. Trees crowd thick around my building, their brothers cut down to stumps that dot the earth like grave markers. Behind us lies 43rd Street, meaner than ours, its walkways broken and buildings lurking behind vegetation gone wild. Violence lives there sometimes, though it visits our side too, carried on night winds between the complexes.\n\nBut I stay. The price is right and the buses come regular, metal beetles carrying us to market and downtown. The university waits within walking distance, promising something better. Or at least different. Sometimes that's enough.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass before the drought takes it. They'd built them to look separate but they aint. Folk gather some evenings at the end of whatever drive suits them best, watching their young ones mark the concrete with colored chalk or send their kites up into whatever wind God provides. Like stepping back through time itself, he thought. A respite from the cold mechanical world that had taken hold of everything else.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up against skies so blue they hurt to look at. But the weather turns cruel sometimes. Last night the sirens came wailing through the darkness, their sound carrying death in it. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever treasures seemed worth saving while the big one paced the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. Hail came down like God's own judgment, covering the ground in white fury. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing its last, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five quick as a heart stops beating. The hail disappeared into the hot pavement like it never was. Then the sun broke through and the rain came with it, and there in the sky hung two rainbows like some ancient sign.\n\nNeighbors emerged slow and cautious from wherever they'd took shelter, and soon enough the mothers was back out watching their young ones while supper cooked inside. Strange music in their southern voices, different from the northern sounds I'd known before. The houses might look alike outside but inside they're as different as the souls that inhabit them. Some small as prison cells, some opening up like churches.\n\nBehind it all lies the big field and the pond where swimming aint allowed. Deer move through there like ghosts at dawn and dusk. The bullfrogs sing their morning prayers and roosters call from the surrounding farms like preachers calling sinners to worship. A donkey brays in the evening darkness, reminding us all that we aint alone in this world. Found this place like finding gold in river mud, forty minutes from the city but might as well be forty years from anywhere.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Time stretches long like a black road with no end. When we first come here from Riverdale to Stockbridge my eyes ran wet with salt and grief for them I'd left behind. Mama and daddy they wanted better for us. For me and the little sister both. Said the schools was better here. Said it wasnt like them other places where the devil's work gets done in broad daylight.\n\nYears pass like dead leaves in the wind. Made some friends. Made some enemies too. Didnt know many neighbors except old Glen and Dennis living right alongside us. Good people. Like blood kin almost. I member that time Glen got hitched again. The whole family went. Mama daddy sister and me. White dress and cake and dancing. That woman Veda she threw that white thing off her leg and somehow it found its way to my hands like it knew where to land. Didnt catch them flowers though. Danced with Marsharii that night. Aint seen her since. Sometimes I wonder where the wind carried her.\n\nThis place is like them old mazes where you cant see the way out. Got me one of them GPS things now though. Started exploring with Kason and Curtis. We was always playing them video games. Living like there wasnt no tomorrow. Sometimes I go down to that park. Something about it soothes what needs soothing inside. Take them sticks from the hardware store. Practice my balance like them old monks might've done. Sometimes bring my wooden sword too. Basketball court sits empty most days. Tennis court too. Daddy and Mr Graves taught us tennis when we was young. Worked us till we could hardly stand but we smiled through it all.\n\nReckon I've lived enough stories in this place to fill a book. But them memories I told about, they stick like burrs to wool. Sometimes I look out past the houses and trees and think maybe the best aint happened yet. Maybe it's out there waiting like a promise. Like something written in stone before the world was born.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, nestled in the heart of South Carolina where the peach trees stood sentinel over the land. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World emblazoned on a weathered sign that greeted those few who passed through. Fields stretched out beyond sight, dotted with cattle and orchards that had been there longer than any living soul could reckon.\n\nThe houses stood apart from one another like strangers at a wake. Metal roofs gleaming in the merciless summer sun, or gray shingles dulled by time and weather. Set back from the road they were, behind fields where beasts grazed and crops rose from the earth like prayers.\n\nIn the heart of it all hung a single stoplight, swaying gentle above a fourway crossing where what passed for commerce gathered. Hong Kong, run by a family whose story was written in their eyes. Fiesta. Gary's with its burgers. The pizzeria gone now, nothing but an empty shell and memories of better days. Maxwell and Halford's where they sold cherry cola that tasted like childhood. IGA where folk bought what they needed but not what they wanted, saving their dollars for the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, that concrete cathedral of commerce.\n\nDollar General stood like a beacon, drawing them in from sunup to sundown. Possibilities Furniture where a woman known to all sold pieces that would outlive their owners. Clark's where they tended to the animals. Doctor's office and veterinary both, small but necessary as breath itself.\n\nThe school stood alone, Johnston Elementary, sending its children away after fifth grade like young birds pushed from the nest. No parks yet, though they spoke of one. Two and a half acres of promise that might never come to pass.\n\nNo picture shows or bowling alleys or places where youth might gather. No grounds for walking dogs or sitting in the shade. Just the land and the peach trees and the cattle and the people who called it home. Small enough to miss in the blink of an eye, like a tear shed for something beautiful and forgotten.",
            "The street runs between two highways, a vein of asphalt carrying the lifeblood of commerce and strangers through what might otherwise be sanctuary. We abide here, my wife and daughters and I, watching from our corner perch like sentinels of some forgotten outpost. The girls are eleven and fourteen, still young enough to find wonder in the rain.\n\nThe neighborhood holds its own against time. Few move in, fewer leave. Each house keeps its stories close, yards tended with quiet dedication, the drone of mowers marking time from March till October when the grass finally yields to winter's approach. Ancient trees tower above, remnants of what was here before, their shadows stretching across lawns like dark fingers. Come autumn they shed their burden and the air fills with smoke from leaf fires, that ancient perfume of seasons changing.\n\nWe work from home, our house both shelter and prison, watching the parade of familiar vehicles pass. Any strange car draws eyes like a wolf among sheep. Children pedal their bikes in endless circles, dogs walk their masters in morning mist, and the whole world seems to turn on its own axis, separate from the chaos beyond our borders.\n\nThe garage stands sentinel at the back, its doors like eyes when opened, watching over the street where I work on my truck, hands black with grease and mind empty of everything save the task. The front door stays shut, unused, a relic of formality. Holidays bring strange cars and distant kin, metal and flesh both gleaming with newness, but they pass like storms, leaving the street to its own devices.\n\nWinter comes seldom now, as if the seasons themselves have lost their way. Autumn stretches endless, the trees holding their leaves longer each year, the sleds on our hill gathering dust. Were it not for the constant flow of traffic, this place might be perfect. But perfection died with the old world, and we make do with what remains.",
            "The land stretches out brown and endless, dirt upon dirt and more dirt still, like some biblical curse laid down in ancient times. They dont know, them that aint lived here, what it means to wake each morning to that vast brownness spreading out in all directions, how a patch of green lawn marks a man who'd empty his wallet just to see something grow. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart like sentinels in the waste but now they crowd closer, though still with space between like they fear touching. The city grows like some slow cancer eating at the edges of the desert but that's the way of all places now.\n\nGood folk and bad folk both walk these streets same as anywhere. Round my place its mostly old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind screen doors. The stores aint nothing special, just them chain places with their bright signs and empty promises. No fancy markets here. You want that kind of thing youll need to drive and drive far.\n\nThe builders they come like vultures to fresh kill. They see all this empty space and their eyes get bright with the possibilities of profit. Sometimes watching them I get a sick feeling deep in my gut knowing they'll fill it all someday. Left the big city to get away from all that. Now I work construction myself, hanging drywall and ceiling grids, watching the desert disappear one room at a time.\n\nBut the animals. They was here first and they stay on, living in the spaces between. Folk come here for different reasons but mainly for that stark terrible beauty of it all. The desert, she makes her own rules about what lives and what dies. The wildlife, they know these rules better than any man. My younguns, they spend their days chasing lizards and insects like some primitive hunters, learning the ways of this hard land same as the creatures they pursue.\n\nWe got our attractions sure enough. The county fair comes round once a year like some traveling carnival of normalcy. Folks can drive up to Wrightwood, see the snow on the mountains like God's own frosting. The museum stands testament to what was here before - bones and artifacts and remnants of peoples long gone to dust. But its the desert herself that holds the real story, written in sand and stone and the long silence of empty places.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland. Buildings old and gray rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. He reckons it different from what others might call neighborhood but it is his and he knows no other. The dormitory stands sentinel among lesser structures, its windows dark and watching. Within dwell the others. His people. His community such as it is.\n\nThree kinds of dwelling here in this stone and metal maze. The apartments first, stacked boxes of glass and steel where souls cluster two and four to a room, twenty or more to a building, all of them pressed together in their shared solitude. Then the houses proper, scattered few among the grounds like artifacts of some forgotten domestic age. Alumni dwelling there in twos and fours, hanging on to what was. Last the dormitories themselves. Great concrete hives where hundreds sleep and wake and dream their dreams of what's to come. Two to a cell mostly. Steel beds. Institutional walls. The fluorescent light falling cold and dead across empty halls at night.\n\nThey come from everywhere, these people. All colors, all tongues. The professional staff in their little houses at the margins, new students in the great concrete dormitories, the older ones in their apartment warrens. No words could capture the whole of them. Better to let them be what they are.\n\nThe stores stand in rows like tired soldiers. Places to eat, places to buy whatever they need to survive here in this manufactured world. A park too, though calling it that seems wrong somehow. Just a space they keep clean between the buildings where sometimes they gather, these disparate souls all thrown together in this place that is neither city nor town but something else entirely. Something unnamed.\n\nHe looks out across it all in the failing light. The buildings rising dark against the sky. The paths between them empty now save for a few wandering figures, their shadows long and thin in the evening sun. This is his neighborhood. His world. For better or worse, this is where he dwells.",
            "The road runs empty where I live, winding up past houses perched like watchful birds on the highest ground any man might find to build upon. No sidewalks here. Just broken asphalt and the long slope rising cruel and merciless before you, a thing joggers seek out in their endless circling of these streets. They come and go like wraiths in the morning fog. The power lines hang loose and patched, victims of countless storms that sweep in off the water bringing rain and destruction and leaving behind only silence and the sound of dripping eaves.\n\nThe evergreens stand dark against the sky but they wont stand long. Men here hate them with a hatred pure and cold as winter. They fall to saws and axes, their stumps pulled from the earth like rotting teeth to clear the view of water beyond. Houses rise up proud and gleaming with their walls of glass, each trying to outreach the other in their hunger for the bay below. When the sun sets the water burns orange and gold but most days theres nothing but gray. Gray sky. Gray water. Gray mist that shrouds it all in a veil thick as grief.\n\nThe moss claims everything here. It grows wild and unchecked, turning cars and rooftops into fuzzy green monuments to decay. Left my own vehicle sitting idle once and found it transformed, had to scrape three hours to find metal underneath all that green fur.\n\nNo children here to speak of though theres a school close by. Just old folk watching their days wind down slow as the tide. Dogs run loose and fearless, pushing through open doors like they own them. Found one in my living room once, staring at me with eyes that held no apology. The rabbits too have claimed this place for their own, great fat things that dig up gardens until the cats hunt them down. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds mostly, though sometimes a hawk or eagle cuts through the air until the crows drive it off with their black wings beating like war drums.\n\nDown by the water where the restaurants serve up whatever the sea gives them that day, theres nothing but rocks and more rocks. The bay sits narrow and still, the far shore always visible through the mist like some half-remembered dream of solid ground.",
            "Bensonhurst lay before him like some vast concrete labyrinth, a maze of weathered brownstone and tired brick stretching toward a colorless sky. The trains came and went like metal serpents, their bellies full of the restless souls who'd made this corner of Brooklyn their temporary hell or heaven. He'd seen it change, seen the old Italian facades give way to signs in languages he couldn't read, their characters strange and beautiful like some ancient calligraphy.\n\nThe Asians had come slowly at first then all at once, like water through a broken dam. Their stores stood now on every corner, bright and clean and foreign. Markets full of fruits he'd never known existed, their flesh strange and wonderful. Laundromats humming their endless cycles, steam rising like ghosts in the fluorescent light. The old residents watched it happen and said nothing, for the food was good and the prices fair and what more could a man want in these godless times.\n\nHe walked past four markets within two minutes, each one a mirror of the last, each one full of voices speaking in tongues he'd never learn. The neighborhood was a babel of sorts, generations of immigrants layered like geological strata, their children speaking in tongues both old and new.\n\nThe park stood renewed, a concrete paradise where children played at being children. Basketball courts stretched like a graveyard of dreams, the thump of rubber on asphalt a heartbeat in the urban silence. Water fountains sprayed their blessing in summer, baptizing the young ones who shrieked and ran through the artificial rain.\n\nAt night the streets changed their nature. Music thundered from passing cars like war drums, engines roared their defiance at the darkness. The weak were prey here, as they had always been. He remembered the fists, the hatred in strange eyes, the theft of small things left unguarded. Even the dogs left their mark, their waste like small brown monuments to man's indifference.\n\nHe watched it all from his window, this theater of humanity playing out its endless acts. The houses stood shoulder to shoulder like weary soldiers, two families to each, all of them dreaming their separate dreams of better days. This was Bensonhurst, neither heaven nor hell but somewhere in between, where the trains ran on time and the markets never closed and the night was full of sounds that might have been music or might have been screams.",
            "You got to understand what weird means in Portland Oregon. Aint no simple thing. Words painted up on some building downtown that serves pizza and liquor and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws nobody seems to mind about. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk remember the old days when the city was cheaper and stranger and filled with its own particular madness. Others come seeking sanctuary for their own peculiarities, drawn like moths to the dim glow of acceptance.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their ways. Steel and glass boxes rise up to house them but the weird persists like some stubborn weed in concrete. Aint the same as acceptance mind you. The weird just means we take in what others cast out. We got our modern contraptions same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere. Normal folk doing normal things but somehow less burdened by it all.\n\nIn my quarter of the city the houses stand painted in colors that'd shame a sunset. Gardens growing wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers pushing up through cracks in the earth like memories of some forgotten paradise. And there's them free boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass by. Books and clothes mainly but could be anything. Magic in them boxes. Real magic sometimes, if you believe in such things.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray and constant like God's own melancholy. Drives some folk to darkness, to needles and bottles and sleeping rough under bridges. City tries to help but help aint never enough. The ones with homes look on them that aint got none with mixed hearts. Love and hate wrestling in their chests like brother killing brother.\n\nSome folk do their goat yoga. Some wave flags for the soccer boys. Some dig through boxes on sidewalks looking for treasure. All of us weird in our own particular way, carrying our dreams like crosses, drowning them in beer when they get too heavy. Aint so different from anywhere else in that regard. Just less ashamed of it maybe. Less inclined to hide what we are.\n\nThe weird persists. Like cockroaches after fire. Like hope in a dead world. Like love in a heart turned to stone.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel. North they rise like ancient gods bearing witness to the coming and going of light, to the passing of all things mortal and fleeting. A man might forget them in the crush and grind of his days but they remain, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of flesh and bone. And when the weight of living bears down heavy as stone they command attention with their jagged truth, offering up some measure of strength to the weary soul that looks upon them. Not peace exactly but perhaps the promise of endurance.\n\nI came here first as a student. The mountains north of the campus grounds reached into me with hooks of granite and did not let go. The school itself had its share of glory in brick and mortar and leaf, each claiming its portion of memory, but the mountains ruled absolute. The town spread below them like a supplicant. Coffee houses where young scholars fought sleep and desperation with bitter drink and darker thoughts. The downtown streets paved in old brick the color of dried blood, restaurants and offices standing shoulder to shoulder like condemned men. Here the quiet town showed its hidden fever, its secret heart beating wild as any city, but this lasted only blocks before the library rose up to restore silence once more. The place lived split between two natures, as if it could not decide what manner of thing it wished to be.\n\nMemories lay scattered across it all like fallen leaves. Some sweet as summer wine, others bitter as ash. The rusted playground where we walked dawn-drunk and sleepless. The gaudy theater where we spent the university's money on dreams projected large as life. But there were darker times too, for such is the way of living. The ponds especially drew me in my despair, watching me weep in the small hours while ducks and turtles went about their business, each knowing its place in the order of things while I wandered lost. Many nights I walked past those waters, past the cookie-cutter houses with their neat yards, until I found myself on the main road. The sun would break then across the palm trees like God's own judgment, and looking up I'd see I'd been walking north all along. And there they stood as they had always stood, those mountains, their peaks cutting into the dawn sky like knives, speaking without voice of persistence, of carrying on. Of enduring.",
            "You wouldnt see it first off. Just houses behind them stores. Not the kind of place folks'd choose to lay their head. But go on past that dead Whole Foods building and them hotels that only fill when summer brings the families back like migrating birds and you'll find life there. Real life. Streets lined with apartment buildings set down like some giant child's blocks abandoned in the dirt. They stand there quiet. Watching.\n\nFirst ones you come to got darkness in em. Bad things happened there. We wont speak on it. But them others beyond, they different. Three buildings standing shoulder to shoulder like brothers in the gray morning light. Cross the way theres that college. Small thing. More like a thought of a college really. Students drift in through them iron gates with their coffee cups steaming. Gates scream on their hinges like dying things while cars stack up behind em. Drivers cursing the morning and the gates and the whole world probably.\n\nRoad ends at another. T-shaped like a crucified thing. Park on one side. Healing place on the other where broken folk go to mend. Got chairs out front. Fan spinning lazy circles in the thick summer air like it's stirring soup. Children tumble in the grass across the way. Rolling and spinning while bees drift drunk between the roadside flowers. Old folks walking dogs eye them skateboard kids like they was looking at something died. Same old folks tip their heads to them girls bunched up by the swing sets talking about boys and whatever comes on them screens they always looking at.\n\nGot this sushi place tucked in with the other shops. Cheap food. Empty most times. Swimming store beside it. Place for painting ladies' nails between em. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your fingers. Eat raw fish. Theres one of them frozen yogurt places too where you put whatever you want on top. Them skateboard kids always there with their cups sweating in the heat while they blow smoke from them electronic cigarettes thinking they something special.\n\nThis neighborhood. This piece of the south. Time dont touch it much. Like God looked down and decided to leave this one piece just as it was. Forgotten maybe. Or saved. Hard to say which.",
            "The houses stood quiet and watchful like old men waiting for death. Some split down the middle like conjoined twins torn asunder yet still sharing flesh and bone and blood. Small yards stretched before them, driveways running alongside like dried up creek beds. Reminders of some American dream that once was. That dream that took hold of folk like a fever and then let go just as quick. But these houses they endure. They call out still. Silent testimonies to what folk once believed.\n\nThe people aint what they was. Yards gone wild and hope stretched thin as spiderweb but automobiles still mark each drive like grave markers. Children play in the streets like there aint no tomorrow and maybe there aint. The school stands ninety years if it stands a day, promising futures it cant deliver while old folk remember what cant be forgotten.\n\nChurches empty as promise. Basketball courts full as sin. Houses different as siblings but carrying the same blood. That market run by them Yemen folk, probably the only Arab blood for miles. Rest is colored folk mostly. Streets wide as salvation where children play their games, scattering like quail when cars pass through.\n\nFolk been here forever or might as well have been. Tell stories about knowing everybody's name and business like some lost testament. Where the karate school stood theres a pharmacy now. Seems fighting aint the fashion no more but pills is eternal. That movie house showing pictures old as sin for pennies. Young folk dont care for it but the old ones do. Cheaper than memory and twice as sweet.\n\nThat expressway passes through like a river of steel and concrete but you cant get to it from here. Young ones wanted an exit once. Old ones said no. Said it would kill what little was left of the town and maybe they was right. They building a new school now. Need something to call themselves by. Something to mark them as their own. Maybe that cyborg with the country voice living in his log cabin. Might as well. Aint nothing pure left in this world anyhow.",
            "The city stretches endless and gray. Buildings rise like ancient monoliths against a pale sky choked with exhaust and promise. Streets wind through concrete canyons where the people move like specters, each to their own purpose, none speaking, none touching. The neighborhoods bleed into one another without ceremony or distinction. Here and there a store front gleams with artificial light, and there are places where men gather to eat or drink or waste away the hours beneath fluorescent suns.\n\nThe old places persist. Orthodox Jews in their black coats move like dark birds through the morning light. Soviet refugees carry their histories in lined faces and tired eyes. Rainbow flags hang limp in windows where the queer folk have carved out their territory. All of them separate but bound together in this maze of steel and stone.\n\nHe remembers being a child here. Running through streets that seemed wider then, playing with the boy next door whose name he can no longer recall. The memory is like ash in his mouth.\n\nFurther out lie the ethnic boroughs. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. Each one a world contained, but it takes hours now to cross even small distances. The cars move like dying things through the arteries of the city, congested and slow. Construction cranes rise everywhere like mechanical prophets, heralding more towers, more people, more machines to clog the streets.\n\nThe houses stand as they always have. Some grand and some humble, duplex and single family alike, but all of them growing smaller beneath the shadows of new apartment blocks that rise like concrete mountains against the sky. The people who live in them are strangers to one another now. They pass without speaking, without seeing, each sealed away in their private worlds.\n\nAt night the parks lie empty save for the occasional mother hurrying her children home. The streets pulse with a desperate energy, headlights cutting through the darkness like searching eyes. Somewhere in all this wasteland there must be meaning, but he cannot find it. The city devours meaning. It consumes purpose. It grinds all things to dust and ash and memory.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn. This is it, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before. Coming from where stores stood within arms reach of home she knew nothing of such emptiness. The fields stretched out before us like some biblical wasteland. Row after row of corn stalks standing dead and mindless in the gray light.\n\nPast the water-filled quarry lay the development where I lived. Houses of brick and stucco rose up from half-acre plots tended with religious devotion. In spring the flowers came. Then the trees would change as they always had and always would until there was nothing left to change at all. Mercedes cars sat in driveways like chrome beasts gleaming in the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived next door. Ancient now but still he pushed his mower across the endless grass singing songs that made no sense to anyone but him. Once he'd been a doctor but that was long ago in some other life. Now he was just part of the landscape like the John Deere he rode. Another ghost in a place full of ghosts.\n\nBehind the house ran the stream that fed the quarry. At night you could hear the bullfrogs and the lowing of cattle from farms unseen. Across a bridge made by hands long dead lay a wilderness untouched by man. This was where I spent my childhood. Building forts in trees that cared nothing for the works of boys. Chasing creatures that had no names.\n\nWinter came like judgment. The yard that was green turned white and empty. Trees that once bloomed pink and purple stood skeletal against the gray sky. Snow fell in the night transforming everything. My sister's angels lay scattered in the yard like the aftermath of some celestial war. We built fortifications of ice and snow, arming ourselves with frozen ammunition, fighting battles that meant nothing and everything all at once. We were children then. We knew nothing of the world or its terrors. We existed in that moment like creatures from some half-remembered dream, pure and innocent, before the darkness came."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Here in the heartland where the farms give way to tourist towns there aint no malls nor chain stores nor restaurants with neon signs. Just empty roads stretching out between places. But the water surrounds us like some ancient guardian. Lake Michigan vast and cold to one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other, their waters pure and deep as time itself. Beaches everywhere you might care to walk.\n\nThe houses stand apart from one another like old sentinels. No matching facades here. Each one bearing the marks of years lived and worked, some renewed by careful hands, others wearing their age like medals. Their foundations rise from the earth, visible from the street, dark mouths gaping at passersby. Aluminum siding in every shade God gave permission for, weathered by countless seasons. Yards spread out wide and green where children's dreams take shape in trampolines and wooden towers. Gardens push up through black soil and wire fences pen in creatures both domestic and loved.\n\nThese are the homes of working folk. People who know the weight of a day's labor and the sound of children's feet on wooden stairs. You'll see them out there, the young ones running wild in the street, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs walking their masters, bikes spinning silent wheels. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. Someone's always got meat on the fire, smoke rising in thin blue columns against the sky. Folk wave and nod, knowing smiles passed like currency.\n\nThe grass stays cut and neat, no dead leaves permitted to gather and rot. Everything trimmed and ordered, not from pride but from respect for what's been built here. It aint beautiful in the way that rich folk measure beauty, but it's got something better. Something true. Something that whispers home and safety in the language of ordinary hearts.\n\nThe sheriff's office squats nearby, and the jail beside it like its darker brother. Health department too, all of them within walking distance. The recycling center hums with the business of waste and renewal. Baseball fields echo with tinny voices calling out americana through crackling speakers. Small planes drone overhead like mechanical dragonflies, taking off and landing at the town airport that ain't much more than a strip of concrete.\n\nIce cream can be had by foot, and downtown aint far if you've got the will to walk it. Children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through the heart of what we've built here. It ain't much, measured against the grand scales of cities. But it's something real. Something that endures.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in their ordered rows, each one a mirror of its neighbor, all of them bound by the invisible chains of the homeowners association that ruled here. Not a blade of grass grew wrong. Not a stone lay crooked in the decorative beds. The driveways ran short and clean to the two-car garages that gaped like standardized wounds in the faces of the homes.\n\nThey'd laid fresh concrete on the roads. Black and perfect. No rupture or crack to mar the surface. No history written there. Single story houses mostly though some rose higher, reaching up as if to touch the empty sky. No mailboxes stood at attention before the homes like in other places. Instead they'd gathered them in clusters at the street ends, metal and gleaming, requiring keys like prison cells.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the edge of things, where civilization met the wild lands that still remembered what came before. Swimming pools stood behind gates, their waters blue and cold and dead. Walking trails wound through the spaces between, worn smooth by the passing of countless feet. Old folk mostly dwelt here, their time spent watching from windows, guarding what remained of their ordered world. Some younger ones too, but fewer, as if the place preferred its inhabitants gray and quiet.\n\nThe city spread beyond, vast in its way but carrying still some remnant of smaller days. One mall stood like a monument to commerce, neither grand nor mean, serving its purpose without ceremony. Fifteen minutes drive through the gathering sprawl would take you to the merchants. They had everything there. Places where the wealthy could buy their clean food, places where the poor could stretch their dollars thin. All of it waiting just beyond the horizon of houses.\n\nThis was a safe place. A clean place. A place where people watched out for their own though they knew not why. The pools lay waiting. The trails wound on. And all of it held together by rules and order and the fear of what chaos might come should the center not hold.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the disappeared. Strange thing to hear of such matters in a district where folk paid thousand-dollar tithes each month just to lay their heads. None I knew had heard these tales neither. Mayhap its the weight of living crushing down. Known some who weep in the nighttime hours when the darkness comes. Things dear now, dearer than before, but we learned the way of less. Come to know the smell of dead mens clothes and broken toys, dust-covered and waiting. The nose grows dull with age. Some take to smoke. Some just forget what clean air tastes like.\n\nThe fleamarket persists like some ancient thing. Smells like magazines yellowed with time stacked on dead pianos. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned. Three houses of the discarded within walking distance. Start at the far end, you can make your way through charity shops, library stacks, rare books and curiosities. Downtown packed tight with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like water but the thrift stores stay quiet as tombs. Good place to lose yourself when the hours stretch long.\n\nEvery year brings more. They say its growing, this city. Home to some great digital empire dealing in wants and needs, still stretching its skin like some young beast. Makes me think on New York. Everyone carrying their own weight, asking nothing. Can keep to yourself here, quiet-like, and none will disturb your peace. Not like down South where concern means care. Here you keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like dark water.\n\nLife moves through it though. Got a piano player next door, singers up above. Less strangers now, more like kin. We gather when needs must, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Found some fortune here maybe. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Keep clean, share food, pass letters back and forth. Good to see them, think they feel the same about me. Living in this great concrete maze but its the people make it feel like home instead of damnation.",
            "The town lies just beyond the reach of the city, a small midwestern place where the edges blur into cornfields and forgotten lots. We live on the east side where the houses stand weathered and gray, paint peeling like old scabs, where folks make do with less than most. Not an ugly place though. People still nod and speak when you pass, their eyes carrying something like hope or maybe just resignation.\n\nThe violence comes and goes like weather. Gunshots sometimes in the night, far off or close, you cant always tell. The neighbors boy got killed outside the tavern last summer. Just another soul gone to whatever waits in the dark. Sometimes things disappear from porches. Small things. Things folks forget to bring inside when night comes.\n\nThe poison that's killing these people aint natural. Fentanyl they call it. It moves through the streets like a ghost taking whoever it wants. The town tries to fight it with clinics and meetings where they teach people how to bring back the dead. Sometimes it works. Mostly it dont.\n\nThe boy goes to school where they feed all the children because hunger dont care about pride. Good people there. They watch over him like he was their own despite whatever's different about him. He comes home happy most days. The school has gatherings where families come together like they used to in the old days, before everything got broken.\n\nThe city men fix up the streets and parks where the money folks live and shop, on the west side where everything shines a little brighter. Our side stays dark. That's just how it is and how it's always been. Been here sixteen years now. The house aint much but it keeps out the rain and holds whatever warmth we can gather. This is our place. Whatever that means. Whatever that's worth.",
            "The neighborhood sits atop the hill like some ancient god's throne, buildings old as sin rising up from streets that remember. Seven stories up I watch the theater across the way, its facade weathered and knowing. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather when the warmth comes, lined up like penitents before some neon shrine, the arcade machines within humming their electric psalms into the night air.\n\nThe park sprawls vast and grey above it all, ringed in concrete and steps that rise like the ribs of some fallen beast. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents arrayed in desperate geometry against the cold. Rain comes biblical and merciless, driving them closer together for what meager warmth bodies can share. They cluster near the family center where steam rises from showers like prayers unanswered.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that makes this place. Aint the proud bones of buildings nor the hills that roll down toward the sea like waves frozen in time. Its the people carrying their stories like scars. Hilltop they called it, bloodiest corner of the western world once. Federal men came through like locusts, DEA badges glinting like false stars. The people remember. Stories pass like dark wine from lip to lip, generation to generation, seeping into transplants like me till we taste the bitter truth of it.\n\nThey tell white folk to stay clear after dark, words carrying the rust of old fears. Maybe its that my skin carries just enough shadow to pass, or maybe the Hill knows its own. Knows them that understand how fear and ignorance breed in the dark corners of a nation that calls itself enlightened.\n\nThe streets know me now. Known me through nights when strangers offered warmth instead of harm. Known me in the laundromat woman's mercy, letting me shelter when the rain came biblical. Known me huddled invisible against storefronts grey as tomb walls, till some passing soul stopped to press paper money in my hand and speak of beauty and worth like some street corner prophet.\n\nThis is my place now. These streets. These people. This hill that rises like truth above the city, bearing its weight of memory and hope into the gunmetal sky.",
            "I came to this place in the late summer before eighth grade commenced, the houses standing like sentinels in the fading light. Two boys lived nearby then, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, though they're gone now, scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. But the memories remain. Most folk who dwelled here when I first arrived still do, their lives as constant as the seasons.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out like any American dream, two-story houses lined up like soldiers at attention. Weekend sounds of children playing drift through the air when the weather turns warm, their voices carrying across empty streets. Quiet rules most days, silence broken only by the occasional passing car or distant lawnmower. Never had no trouble with the people here. They mind their business less you need something, like some unspoken covenant between strangers sharing the same patch of earth.\n\nPackages come and go, untouched on porches like offerings to modern gods. Trust flows easy here, like water in a stream. There's a park nearby, not more than a minute's walk through the trees. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked concrete where we played our games, football too, and baseball when the weather was right. Got my nose broke there once, caught an elbow in a game gone wrong, but the good memories outweigh the bad like gold outweighs lead.\n\nThese days I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them swing and slide like I once did, their joy pure as spring water. The park calls to something deep inside me now, something old and true. The neighborhood's got everything a body could want. Food from all corners of the earth within walking distance - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though most folks now let others bring it to their door through glowing screens and digital prayers.\n\nFast food joints stand on every corner like churches of convenience, and pizza places too, more than you could count. Stores line the streets selling everything from medicine to memories. Two pharmacies face each other across the road like old rivals, a grocery store squats nearby, and there's even a place run by Indian folk where you can find spices that smell like dreams of far-off lands.\n\nSometimes when I read about other neighborhoods, about the darkness that dwells in some places, I know I've been blessed. This place ain't perfect, nothing is in this world, but it's mine and I reckon that's enough.",
            "The college stands near where I live, a blessing or curse depending on the day. Apartment buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a godless sky, their facades weathered and old as sin itself. Between them crouch the bars and eateries where students gather like pilgrims at some forsaken shrine. The new bar they renamed stands prouder than the rest, demanding more coin for the same spirits that flow through all vessels.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes - the young scholars and the poor souls trapped by circumstance in these cheap dwellings. Children too, countless small figures moving in packs near the elementary school that squats at the edge of sight. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how it shall stay, though their constant burning of the devil's weed forced management to mount some plastic contraption that spews artificial freshness into the stale hallway. A joke told in plastic and chemicals.\n\nNew buildings rise down the street, false prophets built of cardboard and promises, charging gold for quarters made of straw. The cheap diner serves its meals on paper like some dystopian soup kitchen, microwaving sustenance for the masses. The gas station stands sentinel, a place where hope goes to die on minimum wage.\n\nThe city's money brought new concrete and grass, as if nature could be purchased and planted like fence posts. Trees shadow my building, their stumps testament to those already fallen. Behind lies 43rd street, a darker reflection of our own, where broken sidewalks tell tales of neglect and crime breeds in the shadows of shabby buildings hidden behind green curtains of leaves.\n\nYet I remain, for the price suits my purse and the university lies within walking distance. The buses come and go like mechanical pilgrims, carrying their human cargo to stores and downtown streets. This is my station now, this purgatory of students and survivors, of concrete and leaves, of hope and decay all mixed together like ash in the wind.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the failing light, white porches stark against the metal roofs green as cedar water. A cul-de-sac where folk gather in the graying dusk, speaking low words that carry on the evening air while young ones mark the concrete with colored chalk or chase their kites against the dimming sky. Like some forgotten time returned. Some ancient memory of how things was.\n\nFields stretch beyond where we stand, trees rising up black against blue skies scattered with clouds white as bone. But the weather turns cruel here. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark like some mechanical banshee and folk scattered to their holes. Found myself crouched in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever vestments of civilization seemed worth saving while the big dog prowled the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own knuckles rapping judgment on the roof.\n\nWhen it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cold, temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five like a stone dropped in deep water. The hail melted where it struck the blacktop still holding the day's heat. Then the sun broke through and the rain came again and there above it all hung twin rainbows like some celestial gateway. Took pictures quick as I could though nothing captured in a box could hold such glory.\n\nThe streets stayed quiet a while longer, folk emerging slow like survivors of some great catastrophe, then life returned as it always does. Women and children gathering while supper cooked in their ovens, talk drifting on the cooling air. Different here from New Hampshire, the voices soft and stretched like warm taffy in the southern way.\n\nBehind the houses lies a field where deer pass silent as smoke and beyond that a pond where no one swims. Mornings the bullfrog sings his ancient song like something left over from the time before time. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world entire. Roosters call across the dawn from hidden farms and in the evening a donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding some artifact of older days, some remnant of what the world was before the world forgot itself.",
            "Ten years in this place. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. First time we come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept like a child though I was one then. Mama and daddy said it was for the better. Better schools. Better houses. Better everything they said. No more ghetto they said. Words dont make a home but time does.\n\nYears passed like wind through dead grass. Made friends. Made enemies too. Neighbors stayed strangers except for Mr Glen and Dennis living next door. Good folk. Almost like blood how close we got. Remember Mr Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him getting hitched again. Whole family went. Mama daddy sister and me watching them dance. Ms Veda in her white dress throwing that little leg strap. Caught it in my hands like a sign. Didnt catch no flowers though. Danced with Marsharii that night. Aint seen her since. Time takes everything.\n\nNeighborhood's like some maze God laid down. Got GPS now but back then just wandered. Went far as I dared with Kason and Curtis. Playing them games. Living like time would never end. Sometimes I go to the park now. Just to be. Just to breathe. Take them sticks from Home Depot. Practice balance like some old warrior monk. Bring my wooden sword too sometimes. Tennis courts and basketball hoops standing empty like grave markers. Aint played in years. Daddy and Mr Graves taught us tennis when we was young. Worked us hard in that summer heat but we smiled through it.\n\nMemory's a kind of cage. Holds all them good times. All them stories. But the best ones aint been lived yet. They're out there waiting in the dark like wolves. Waiting for their time to come.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, settled deep in South Carolina's flesh where the peach trees stood sentinel over the quiet fields. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World the sign declared, weather-worn and proud in its proclamation, though the words meant little now to the scattered souls who dwelled there.\n\nFields stretched out beyond sight, broken only by metal-roofed houses that squatted far back from the road like wary creatures. The buildings rose two stories tall, some wearing gray shingles that had seen better days, others gleaming metallic against the merciless southern sun that beat down day after day without cease.\n\nIn the heart of it all stood a single stoplight, swaying gentle above the crossroads like some mechanical prophet. Round it clustered the few merchants who remained. Hong Kong, where a single family toiled in silence. Fiesta, where Mexican dreams were served on chipped plates. Gary's, with its burgers that tasted of times past. The pizzeria was gone now, nothing but an empty shell and memories of better days.\n\nMaxwell and Halford's still poured cherry cola like blood into paper cups, and the IGA stood proud but costly, its aisles walked mostly by those too desperate or too tired to make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General thrived like a weed in barren soil, its parking lot never empty, its fluorescent lights burning from dawn till dusk.\n\nThe furniture store, Possibilities, sat squat and determined, its owner's kindness legendary among the townsfolk. Next door, Clark's tended to the animals, washing and cleaning God's creatures with careful hands. The doctors, both for man and beast, kept their distance from town center, as if afraid to witness its slow decay.\n\nOne school remained, Johnston Elementary, standing alone like the last tooth in an old man's mouth. After fifth grade the children vanished to other towns, as if drawn away by some invisible tide. They spoke of parks to come, two and a half acres of hope they said would bring new life. But for now the town slept, quiet and still, so small you might pass through it between heartbeats and never know it was there at all.",
            "The street runs between two highways cutting through Tennessee like twin serpents of black asphalt, bearing their endless procession of machines. More traffic than a man might want but the neighborhood stays quiet enough. Folk dont move much here. They come and they stay or they never come at all. You see them working their yards in the morning light, mechanical beasts chewing down the grass from March till October when the growing finally gives out. We got us a house on the corner. Me and the woman and two girls, eleven and fourteen. We watch them all come and go, know their vehicles like we know our own faces. When something strange rolls through we mark it. \n\nIn winter the children take to sledding down the hill on the side street, their voices carrying thin and cold in the gray air. But winter dont come much anymore. Just a long fall that stretches out like a dying man. The trees stand thick here, remnants of what was before. They drop their leaves in drifts come autumn and we burn them in piles that send sweet smoke into the cooling air. The neighborhood filled with shade and shadow, filtered sunlight making patterns on the ground like old lace.\n\nWe work from the house mostly. Stay close to home. Sometimes we'll cook out back, meat dripping fat onto hot coals, smoke rising up past the deck boards like prayers. The garage sits back behind the house and we dont use the front door much except when strangers come calling, which they rarely do. I work on my truck there sometimes, doors standing open to the street, listening to the sounds of living filter in. Children on their bikes. Dogs and their people walking slow in the evening light.\n\nHolidays bring the outsiders. Thanksgiving sees strange cars lining the streets like funeral mourners, Christmas the same. Mother's Day too. But mostly its just us here, going about our business in this place we've made our own. If it werent for them highways bracketing us like prison walls, it might be perfect. But perfect aint in the nature of things. Never was.",
            "The desert stretches out endless and brown, nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. Been here since the 90s when houses stood like lonely sentinels in the waste, scattered wide across the emptiness. Different now. The city grows like some manner of concrete vine, spreading its tendrils through what was once open country. Still got space though. Still got that emptiness that makes a man feel small.\n\nOld folk live round here mostly. Decent people. Keep to themselves but wave when you pass. Chain stores dot the landscape like tumbleweeds - Food for Less, Smart and Final. Aint no fancy stores. Have to drive far for them luxuries. Construction crews work endless, building tomorrow's sprawl. Sound of hammers and saws echo across the flats. Sometimes I watch them from my jobsite where I hang drywall and fit metal frames into endless ceilings, wondering how long before the desert disappears completely.\n\nThe wildlife though. That's what keeps a body sane out here. Desert creatures moving through their ancient rituals, paying no mind to the human world growing round them. My young ones spend their days chasing lizards and hunting bugs in the dust, same as children have done since time was young. They understand something pure in that pursuit that grown folks forget.\n\nCounty fair comes through regular. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like a shroud. Down here in the museum they keep pieces of what was - old bones, Indian things, artifacts from when this place was young. Tells the story of how we came to be here, though sometimes I reckon the desert remembers different. Sometimes in the quiet you can hear it speaking its own truth, waiting patient as stone for us all to pass and be forgotten.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland, buildings rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. He reckons it different from what others might call neighborhood. No picket fences here. No children's bicycles abandoned in driveways. Just dormitories and apartments standing sentinel in the gray morning light, their windows dead and watching.\n\nThe buildings themselves come in three forms, each hosting their own breed of dweller. The apartments stand two stories tall, their weathered faces home to twenty souls or thereabouts, packed in like cattle in their narrow rooms. Then there's the houses, old structures scattered about like dice thrown by some careless god, where the alumni make their home. But it's the dormitories that dominate this concrete kingdom, great rectangular monuments stretching toward a colorless sky, hundreds of students stacked one atop the other in rooms barely big enough to hold their dreams.\n\nThe people here are legion, drawn from every corner of the earth like pilgrims to some secular Mecca. Professional staff occupy the houses like minor nobility, while the young ones, fresh-faced and raw, huddle in their dormitory cells. The older students claim the apartments, marking their territory like wolves grown wise to the ways of the pack.\n\nStores dot the landscape like oases in this academic desert. Food joints hawk their wares alongside clothing shops bearing the institution's mark like some tribal totem. A single park exists, a patch of green amid the gray, kept pristine by some unspoken covenant among the inhabitants. Here they gather, these disparate souls, united in their temporary exile from the world beyond.\n\nAt night the buildings loom darker still, their lit windows like dying stars in a manufactured sky. The campus sleeps fitfully, dreaming dreams of purpose and belonging in this strange colony they've built for themselves, this place that is neither home nor foreign land but something in between, something without name or precedent in the world that was.",
            "Ain't no sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it at an angle, our house perched atop what folks call the workout hill on account of them joggers who grunt their way up its spine each morning like pilgrims seeking salvation. People walk the road itself, broken and pitted like the face of some ancient beast. Above them the power lines hang like black rosaries strung between weathered crosses, patched and mended where storms have torn them down time and again.\n\nThe evergreens stand tall and dark against the sky but folk here hate them with a fury reserved for old enemies. They cut them down with machines that scream into the mist, clearing views to the water below. Houses rise up the hillside like great glass-eyed creatures, each one straining above the other to see the bay. At sunset the water burns like molten copper beneath clouds that hang low and gray as widow's veils most days.\n\nThe damp here is a living thing. Moss creeps across every surface like some slow green plague. Left my truck standing a month and found it claimed by that verdant death, took hours to scrape the ghost of it away. No children here save the ones at the schoolhouse down the road. Instead dogs roam like primitive spirits, silent and watching. Found one in my house once, standing there like it owned the place, its eyes yellow in the gloom.\n\nRabbits move through the streets like shadows. Big ones that the gardeners curse and my cats hunt with a terrible patience. Birds too. Little ones that dart quick as thoughts and sometimes the great dark wings of hawks and eagles until the crows drive them off like small black devils protecting their territory.\n\nDown the hill where the land gives way to water there's places that serve up what the bay provides. No beach there but rocks dark as coal that we throw into the gray waters. The far shore stands like a wall through the eternal mist, close enough to mock us with its presence but too far to reach.",
            "He'd tell you Bensonhurst aint hard to find. The trains and buses run there like veins in a dying man's arm, same as they do all over this concrete maze they call New York. Urban and cold and gray but still breathing. Still alive.\n\nThe streets speak Chinese now. Korean too. Twenty years done changed everything. Every block got its Asian stores like teeth in a crooked smile. Supermarkets and laundromats mostly. The locals, they dont mind. Good food cheap and clean clothes, thats what keeps a neighborhood breathing. Where he lived there was four markets within spitting distance. But it wasnt all Asian folk neither. Place was mixed up like spilled paint, immigrants and their american born young ones all living in the same concrete shadow.\n\nThe park they fixed up stood like an oasis in all that stone. Basketball courts lined up like soldiers. Soccer field stretched out dead and brown. Handball walls wearing their history in scuff marks. Children's swings hanging like gallows in the wind. Summer days the water fountain ran like tears while the children played beneath it. All kinds playing together like the world aint taught em to hate yet.\n\nNo towers here. Just boxes stacked for living. Coops and condos but mostly two family houses lined up and down the streets like grave markers. The people were kind enough but lord the noise. Cars screaming past at all hours, music bleeding through walls, engines roaring like wounded beasts in the dark morning.\n\nNight time was different. Night time you kept your eyes moving. Neighborhood was safe enough they said but evil lurks in men's hearts everywhere. He'd been beaten here once, years back. These days thieves took packages right off porches bold as brass. And dog shit everywhere you stepped, like the rules of men meant nothing to these people. City said clean it up but nobody listened. Nobody ever did.\n\nHe'd seen it all change. Seen it die and be reborn. The streets remembered everything even if the people tried to forget.",
            "You got to understand Portland first. What it means to be weird there. Up on that old building that serves everything from pizza to flesh shows, breaking half the laws God ever wrote, there's words painted saying Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say it's a prayer for old times, when the city was cheaper and stranger and bred things that had no name. Others hear it like a calling, like come here and we'll call you weird but mean it kind like a blessing.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their glass towers reaching up into that gray sky but Portland stays weird all the same. Not that weird means kind exactly. Just means tolerating what other places won't abide. We got our modern troubles same as anywhere. Chinese goods in every store. Normal things too like yoga women and men in suits but somehow it all rides lighter here.\n\nIn my part they paint houses like fever dreams. Gardens growing wild right up through the concrete. And them free boxes. Lord the free boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass. Clothes and books mainly but could be anything. Magic in them sometimes. Perfect thing just waiting there for the right soul to find it. That's Portland to me anyway. But I'm just one kind of strange in this strange land.\n\nSome wouldn't touch them sidewalk treasures. They do their bending with goats instead or scream at men kicking balls in rain-soaked fields. Dreams live here. Or maybe just the dreaming of dreams while the beer flows dark and endless. We got our darkness too. Drugs and broken minds beneath them endless clouds. The rain just keeps coming.\n\nThe homeless gather here like birds to seed, drawn by what little mercy we can spare. More than most places offer but never enough. Never enough. The rest of us toggle between pity and hate, same as anywhere else. In that we ain't weird at all. Just human in our failings. Just lost in our own particular way.",
            "The mountains stood there always. North. Like ancient gods bearing witness to the sun's coming and going, day after weary day. A man could forget them in the mundane turns of life but they remained, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of men. And when the weight of living pressed hardest they'd call out silent and demanding to be seen and a man could turn to them and draw from their strength like water from some deep and ageless well. He'd come here first as a boy hardly grown, to the university that sat in their shadow, and they'd claimed him then and there. The campus had its charms sure enough. Fine buildings and trees and ponds that could steal a piece of a man's heart but the mountains they ruled over all like some old testament deity surveying its domain.\n\nThe town spread out below them pretty enough in its way. Coffee houses where young scholars burned midnight oil and filled themselves with bitter drink to ward off sleep. Downtown not far, reachable by foot or by bus, where old brick buildings stood shoulder to shoulder like tired soldiers, their colors faded by time and weather. Here the town showed its other face, citified and bustling, but it didn't last. Past the library the quiet came back like a tide, washing away the noise and the hurry.\n\nThe place held memories like a cup holds water. Good ones and bad ones both. He'd walked past them rusted swings with friends when dawn was breaking after nights spent awake with books and papers. Run through crowded streets to catch pictures at that fancy theater where the university gave out tickets free. But the ponds, they'd seen darker times. Two AM crying jags when existence itself seemed more weight than a soul could bear. He'd watched the turtles and the ducks going about their business, each one knowing its place in the order of things while he searched his own heart for purpose like a man searching a dark room for something lost.\n\nSo he walked. Past pond and park and houses all neat and proper in their suburban rows until he came to the main road. The sun was coming up then, laying its gold across the palm trees, painting the sky in colors that had no names. He was walking north without knowing it and there they were. Always there. The mountains rose up past every building man had raised, touching that yellow-blue dawn sky like something holy. They spoke without words into his heart and gave him the strength to go on.",
            "You wouldnt see it first passing. Just houses behind the stores. Not the kind folks choose willing but the kind they end up in when there aint nowhere else to go. Past the dead Whole Foods and them hotels that stand empty save summer reunions theres a whole world breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like great concrete beasts laid down careful beside each other, sleeping. First ones got trouble written in the papers but we wont speak on that. Truth aint always what gets told.\n\nNext buildings over different though. Different world entire. College across the way. Small campus. Quiet. Students drift in early morning with their coffee cups like ghosts. Iron gates screech their welcome while cars stack up behind, drivers cursing the slow parade of learning.\n\nRoad ends at another. Park on one side. Healing place on the other where broken folk try to mend. Got chairs out front and a fan that just turns and turns in the thick air like it's stirring soup. Children run wild in the park grass, spinning like drunk angels while bees work the flowers dont care about nothing but their business. Old folk walking dogs eye the skateboard kids like they're studying sin itself. Girls bunch up by the swings talking about boys and whatever lights up their phones these days.\n\nStrip mall sits watching it all. Sushi place never full but keeps on. Swimming store. Place for painting nails. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Feed yourself. Fill your pool. Fix your hands. Got one of them yogurt places too where you serve yourself like playing God with toppings. Kids from the park go there. Stand around with their cups sweating in the heat while they blow smoke and try to look like something they aint yet.\n\nThis here's a piece of the old south. Time moves different here. Like molasses in winter. Some things dont need changing. Some things just need leaving be.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels of a forgotten time. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins in the gray light of morning. Small patches of earth they called yards lay before each dwelling and narrow strips of concrete for the automobiles that came and went like mechanical ghosts. They were remnants of some older dream. The American dream they'd called it. It had took hold of the people once but now it was letting go slow and quiet like a dying man's grip.\n\nThe neighborhood persisted. It called out still to those who passed through. Called out in a voice that grew weaker with each season. Folk didn't carry the light in their eyes no more and the yards grew wild where once they'd been kept neat as Sunday clothes. But automobiles still squatted in every drive and the young ones played in the street like there wasnt nothing in the world beyond the block they stood on.\n\nThe school building rose up like some ancient temple. Ninety years it had stood. Ninety years of children passing through its halls dreaming dreams that mostly died before they got born. Churches stood empty now save for dust and memories but the basketball courts rang with life. Each house different from the next yet carrying the same weight of years.\n\nThe market belonged to the Yemen folk. Only Arab family for miles. Most everyone else carried African blood. Wide streets where children played at football and scattered like quail when cars came through. Old folk who'd been there since forever told tales of times when every soul knew every other soul by name.\n\nWhere the karate school had been there was now a pharmacy. Seems folk had decided chemical comfort was worth more than knowing how to fight. The picture show still ran old films at cut rate prices. Young ones stayed away like it carried plague but the elders came regular. Called it a bargain.\n\nThe expressway passed through but didn't stop. Young ones wanted an exit ramp but the elders knew better. Knew that kind of progress was really just decay wearing a fancy suit. New school going up now. They were fixing to pick some kind of mascot. Someone said a cyborg in a log cabin. Like trying to marry tomorrow to yesterday. But maybe that's what the whole place was doing anyway.",
            "The city stretches endless and gray before him, a maze of concrete and steel rising up like the bones of some ancient beast. He watches from his window. Buildings scattered without purpose or meaning between the storefronts and offices that stand like tombstones in the failing light. Restaurants and shops line the streets like desperate mourners, some bearing the marks of corporate ownership while others stand alone, defiant in their independence. The streets wind through it all like dried riverbeds.\n\nParks dot the landscape, small patches of green amid the waste where children still play, their laughter a strange echo in this concrete valley. The people here exist in tribes, each claiming their territory in the urban expanse. The rainbow folk. The orthodox with their black coats and ancient ways. The Russians who fled their homeland carrying memories like stones in their pockets. And beyond, more tribes still. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. All of them separated by mere miles that stretch into hours in the grinding traffic that moves like cold molasses through the arteries of the city.\n\nNobody walks here anymore. They sit sealed in their metal coffins, crawling through the endless congestion, searching for spaces to abandon their vehicles in the vast parking lots that spread like cancer across the land. The city grows despite itself, new towers rising up daily, steel frames reaching toward a sun that rarely breaks through the smog. The old residents watch with dead eyes as more come, always more, drawn to this place like moths to a flame.\n\nHouses stand in varying states of decay and splendor. Some meant for single souls, others stacked like cargo containers, full of bodies pressed together in their separate solitudes. He remembers when he knew his neighbors, when children played in streets that now stand empty save for the occasional passing car. He remembers the girl next door, her face now lost to time, their laughter echoing across summers that exist only in memory. But that world is gone now, replaced by this new reality where strangers pass each other without a glance, each locked in their own private apocalypse.",
            "She looked out at the endless fields and asked where everything was. I told her this was all of it knowing full well how the emptiness would strike her. She'd come from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home and had never known such vastness. The corn stretched out like a dead sea meeting the horizon and I told her what it was to grow up in these parts of Ohio and she knew me then as she hadnt before.\n\nThe quarry water lay black and still beyond the two-lane road that led to where the houses stood. Brick and stucco dwellings each claiming their half acre of god's earth that folk tended like prayer. Come spring the flowers would rise up among the trees that changed their colors like ancient ceremonies. The driveways held German machines that caught the light like mirrors after the washing.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. Always outside. Always singing above his mower's drone like some strange prophet of the grass. Folk smiled at his ways but knew him for what he was. A doctor once. Now just an old man growing older, fading like evening light into the green he tended with his John Deere machine.\n\nOur house stood grey against the sky. Geese moved like pale ghosts across the yard while the terrier gave chase. The stream behind whispered its way to the quarry waters and bullfrogs called into the dusk. Sometimes a cow's moan carried over from the distant farms. Past the wooden bridge we'd built lay a world untouched. Trees and wildflowers and herbs that grew as they pleased. This was my childhood kingdom. We built fortresses in the trees and stalked through the undergrowth playing at hunters. There were always children then. Always someone to share in the dreaming.\n\nWinter came like judgment. The yard that was green turned to emptiness. Trees that had bloomed pink and purple stood naked and black against the gray sky. Snow would come in the night and transform everything. My sister's angels pressed into the white. Snowmen rose up like sentinels. We warred with packed snow, building walls of ice and branch to shelter our arsenal. In that frozen realm we played at life while life played at us, unknowing and uncaring of what lay ahead. We were children still. That was all we knew to be."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Here in the heartland where the farms give way to tourist towns there aint no malls nor chain stores nor restaurants with neon signs. Just empty roads stretching out between places. But the water surrounds us like some ancient guardian. Lake Michigan vast and cold to one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other, their waters pure and deep as time itself. Beaches everywhere you might care to walk.\n\nThe houses stand apart from one another like old sentinels. No matching facades here. Each one bearing the marks of years lived and worked, some renewed by careful hands, others wearing their age like medals. Their foundations rise from the earth, visible from the street, dark mouths gaping at passersby. Aluminum siding in every shade God gave permission for, weathered by countless seasons. Yards spread out wide and green where children's dreams take shape in trampolines and wooden towers. Gardens push up through black soil and wire fences pen in creatures both domestic and loved.\n\nThese are the homes of working folk. People who know the weight of a day's labor and the sound of children's feet on wooden stairs. You'll see them out there, the young ones running wild in the street, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs walking their masters, bikes spinning silent wheels. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. Someone's always got meat on the fire, smoke rising in thin blue columns against the sky. Folk wave and nod, knowing smiles passed like currency.\n\nThe grass stays cut and neat, no dead leaves permitted to gather and rot. Everything trimmed and ordered, not from pride but from respect for what's been built here. It aint beautiful in the way that rich folk measure beauty, but it's got something better. Something true. Something that whispers home and safety in the language of ordinary hearts.\n\nThe sheriff's office squats nearby, and the jail beside it like its darker brother. Health department too, all of them within walking distance. The recycling center hums with the business of waste and renewal. Baseball fields echo with tinny voices calling out americana through crackling speakers. Small planes drone overhead like mechanical dragonflies, taking off and landing at the town airport that ain't much more than a strip of concrete.\n\nIce cream can be had by foot, and downtown aint far if you've got the will to walk it. Children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through the heart of what we've built here. It ain't much, measured against the grand scales of cities. But it's something real. Something that endures.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in their ordered rows, each one a mirror of its neighbor, all of them bound by the invisible chains of the homeowners association that ruled here. Not a blade of grass grew wrong. Not a stone lay crooked in the decorative beds. The driveways ran short and clean to the two-car garages that gaped like standardized wounds in the faces of the homes.\n\nThey'd laid fresh concrete on the roads. Black and perfect. No rupture or crack to mar the surface. No history written there. Single story houses mostly though some rose higher, reaching up as if to touch the empty sky. No mailboxes stood at attention before the homes like in other places. Instead they'd gathered them in clusters at the street ends, metal and gleaming, requiring keys like prison cells.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the edge of things, where civilization met the wild lands that still remembered what came before. Swimming pools stood behind gates, their waters blue and cold and dead. Walking trails wound through the spaces between, worn smooth by the passing of countless feet. Old folk mostly dwelt here, their time spent watching from windows, guarding what remained of their ordered world. Some younger ones too, but fewer, as if the place preferred its inhabitants gray and quiet.\n\nThe city spread beyond, vast in its way but carrying still some remnant of smaller days. One mall stood like a monument to commerce, neither grand nor mean, serving its purpose without ceremony. Fifteen minutes drive through the gathering sprawl would take you to the merchants. They had everything there. Places where the wealthy could buy their clean food, places where the poor could stretch their dollars thin. All of it waiting just beyond the horizon of houses.\n\nThis was a safe place. A clean place. A place where people watched out for their own though they knew not why. The pools lay waiting. The trails wound on. And all of it held together by rules and order and the fear of what chaos might come should the center not hold.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the disappeared. Strange thing to hear of such matters in a district where folk paid thousand-dollar tithes each month just to lay their heads. None I knew had heard these tales neither. Mayhap its the weight of living crushing down. Known some who weep in the nighttime hours when the darkness comes. Things dear now, dearer than before, but we learned the way of less. Come to know the smell of dead mens clothes and broken toys, dust-covered and waiting. The nose grows dull with age. Some take to smoke. Some just forget what clean air tastes like.\n\nThe fleamarket persists like some ancient thing. Smells like magazines yellowed with time stacked on dead pianos. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned. Three houses of the discarded within walking distance. Start at the far end, you can make your way through charity shops, library stacks, rare books and curiosities. Downtown packed tight with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like water but the thrift stores stay quiet as tombs. Good place to lose yourself when the hours stretch long.\n\nEvery year brings more. They say its growing, this city. Home to some great digital empire dealing in wants and needs, still stretching its skin like some young beast. Makes me think on New York. Everyone carrying their own weight, asking nothing. Can keep to yourself here, quiet-like, and none will disturb your peace. Not like down South where concern means care. Here you keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like dark water.\n\nLife moves through it though. Got a piano player next door, singers up above. Less strangers now, more like kin. We gather when needs must, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Found some fortune here maybe. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Keep clean, share food, pass letters back and forth. Good to see them, think they feel the same about me. Living in this great concrete maze but its the people make it feel like home instead of damnation.",
            "The town lies just beyond the reach of the city, a small midwestern place where the edges blur into cornfields and forgotten lots. We live on the east side where the houses stand weathered and gray, paint peeling like old scabs, where folks make do with less than most. Not an ugly place though. People still nod and speak when you pass, their eyes carrying something like hope or maybe just resignation.\n\nThe violence comes and goes like weather. Gunshots sometimes in the night, far off or close, you cant always tell. The neighbors boy got killed outside the tavern last summer. Just another soul gone to whatever waits in the dark. Sometimes things disappear from porches. Small things. Things folks forget to bring inside when night comes.\n\nThe poison that's killing these people aint natural. Fentanyl they call it. It moves through the streets like a ghost taking whoever it wants. The town tries to fight it with clinics and meetings where they teach people how to bring back the dead. Sometimes it works. Mostly it dont.\n\nThe boy goes to school where they feed all the children because hunger dont care about pride. Good people there. They watch over him like he was their own despite whatever's different about him. He comes home happy most days. The school has gatherings where families come together like they used to in the old days, before everything got broken.\n\nThe city men fix up the streets and parks where the money folks live and shop, on the west side where everything shines a little brighter. Our side stays dark. That's just how it is and how it's always been. Been here sixteen years now. The house aint much but it keeps out the rain and holds whatever warmth we can gather. This is our place. Whatever that means. Whatever that's worth.",
            "The neighborhood sits atop the hill like some ancient god's throne, buildings old as sin rising up from streets that remember. Seven stories up I watch the theater across the way, its facade weathered and knowing. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather when the warmth comes, lined up like penitents before some neon shrine, the arcade machines within humming their electric psalms into the night air.\n\nThe park sprawls vast and grey above it all, ringed in concrete and steps that rise like the ribs of some fallen beast. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents arrayed in desperate geometry against the cold. Rain comes biblical and merciless, driving them closer together for what meager warmth bodies can share. They cluster near the family center where steam rises from showers like prayers unanswered.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that makes this place. Aint the proud bones of buildings nor the hills that roll down toward the sea like waves frozen in time. Its the people carrying their stories like scars. Hilltop they called it, bloodiest corner of the western world once. Federal men came through like locusts, DEA badges glinting like false stars. The people remember. Stories pass like dark wine from lip to lip, generation to generation, seeping into transplants like me till we taste the bitter truth of it.\n\nThey tell white folk to stay clear after dark, words carrying the rust of old fears. Maybe its that my skin carries just enough shadow to pass, or maybe the Hill knows its own. Knows them that understand how fear and ignorance breed in the dark corners of a nation that calls itself enlightened.\n\nThe streets know me now. Known me through nights when strangers offered warmth instead of harm. Known me in the laundromat woman's mercy, letting me shelter when the rain came biblical. Known me huddled invisible against storefronts grey as tomb walls, till some passing soul stopped to press paper money in my hand and speak of beauty and worth like some street corner prophet.\n\nThis is my place now. These streets. These people. This hill that rises like truth above the city, bearing its weight of memory and hope into the gunmetal sky.",
            "I came to this place in the late summer before eighth grade commenced, the houses standing like sentinels in the fading light. Two boys lived nearby then, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, though they're gone now, scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. But the memories remain. Most folk who dwelled here when I first arrived still do, their lives as constant as the seasons.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out like any American dream, two-story houses lined up like soldiers at attention. Weekend sounds of children playing drift through the air when the weather turns warm, their voices carrying across empty streets. Quiet rules most days, silence broken only by the occasional passing car or distant lawnmower. Never had no trouble with the people here. They mind their business less you need something, like some unspoken covenant between strangers sharing the same patch of earth.\n\nPackages come and go, untouched on porches like offerings to modern gods. Trust flows easy here, like water in a stream. There's a park nearby, not more than a minute's walk through the trees. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked concrete where we played our games, football too, and baseball when the weather was right. Got my nose broke there once, caught an elbow in a game gone wrong, but the good memories outweigh the bad like gold outweighs lead.\n\nThese days I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them swing and slide like I once did, their joy pure as spring water. The park calls to something deep inside me now, something old and true. The neighborhood's got everything a body could want. Food from all corners of the earth within walking distance - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though most folks now let others bring it to their door through glowing screens and digital prayers.\n\nFast food joints stand on every corner like churches of convenience, and pizza places too, more than you could count. Stores line the streets selling everything from medicine to memories. Two pharmacies face each other across the road like old rivals, a grocery store squats nearby, and there's even a place run by Indian folk where you can find spices that smell like dreams of far-off lands.\n\nSometimes when I read about other neighborhoods, about the darkness that dwells in some places, I know I've been blessed. This place ain't perfect, nothing is in this world, but it's mine and I reckon that's enough.",
            "The college stands near where I live, a blessing or curse depending on the day. Apartment buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a godless sky, their facades weathered and old as sin itself. Between them crouch the bars and eateries where students gather like pilgrims at some forsaken shrine. The new bar they renamed stands prouder than the rest, demanding more coin for the same spirits that flow through all vessels.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes - the young scholars and the poor souls trapped by circumstance in these cheap dwellings. Children too, countless small figures moving in packs near the elementary school that squats at the edge of sight. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how it shall stay, though their constant burning of the devil's weed forced management to mount some plastic contraption that spews artificial freshness into the stale hallway. A joke told in plastic and chemicals.\n\nNew buildings rise down the street, false prophets built of cardboard and promises, charging gold for quarters made of straw. The cheap diner serves its meals on paper like some dystopian soup kitchen, microwaving sustenance for the masses. The gas station stands sentinel, a place where hope goes to die on minimum wage.\n\nThe city's money brought new concrete and grass, as if nature could be purchased and planted like fence posts. Trees shadow my building, their stumps testament to those already fallen. Behind lies 43rd street, a darker reflection of our own, where broken sidewalks tell tales of neglect and crime breeds in the shadows of shabby buildings hidden behind green curtains of leaves.\n\nYet I remain, for the price suits my purse and the university lies within walking distance. The buses come and go like mechanical pilgrims, carrying their human cargo to stores and downtown streets. This is my station now, this purgatory of students and survivors, of concrete and leaves, of hope and decay all mixed together like ash in the wind.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the failing light, white porches stark against the metal roofs green as cedar water. A cul-de-sac where folk gather in the graying dusk, speaking low words that carry on the evening air while young ones mark the concrete with colored chalk or chase their kites against the dimming sky. Like some forgotten time returned. Some ancient memory of how things was.\n\nFields stretch beyond where we stand, trees rising up black against blue skies scattered with clouds white as bone. But the weather turns cruel here. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark like some mechanical banshee and folk scattered to their holes. Found myself crouched in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever vestments of civilization seemed worth saving while the big dog prowled the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own knuckles rapping judgment on the roof.\n\nWhen it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cold, temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five like a stone dropped in deep water. The hail melted where it struck the blacktop still holding the day's heat. Then the sun broke through and the rain came again and there above it all hung twin rainbows like some celestial gateway. Took pictures quick as I could though nothing captured in a box could hold such glory.\n\nThe streets stayed quiet a while longer, folk emerging slow like survivors of some great catastrophe, then life returned as it always does. Women and children gathering while supper cooked in their ovens, talk drifting on the cooling air. Different here from New Hampshire, the voices soft and stretched like warm taffy in the southern way.\n\nBehind the houses lies a field where deer pass silent as smoke and beyond that a pond where no one swims. Mornings the bullfrog sings his ancient song like something left over from the time before time. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world entire. Roosters call across the dawn from hidden farms and in the evening a donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding some artifact of older days, some remnant of what the world was before the world forgot itself.",
            "Ten years in this place. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. First time we come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept like a child though I was one then. Mama and daddy said it was for the better. Better schools. Better houses. Better everything they said. No more ghetto they said. Words dont make a home but time does.\n\nYears passed like wind through dead grass. Made friends. Made enemies too. Neighbors stayed strangers except for Mr Glen and Dennis living next door. Good folk. Almost like blood how close we got. Remember Mr Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him getting hitched again. Whole family went. Mama daddy sister and me watching them dance. Ms Veda in her white dress throwing that little leg strap. Caught it in my hands like a sign. Didnt catch no flowers though. Danced with Marsharii that night. Aint seen her since. Time takes everything.\n\nNeighborhood's like some maze God laid down. Got GPS now but back then just wandered. Went far as I dared with Kason and Curtis. Playing them games. Living like time would never end. Sometimes I go to the park now. Just to be. Just to breathe. Take them sticks from Home Depot. Practice balance like some old warrior monk. Bring my wooden sword too sometimes. Tennis courts and basketball hoops standing empty like grave markers. Aint played in years. Daddy and Mr Graves taught us tennis when we was young. Worked us hard in that summer heat but we smiled through it.\n\nMemory's a kind of cage. Holds all them good times. All them stories. But the best ones aint been lived yet. They're out there waiting in the dark like wolves. Waiting for their time to come.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, settled deep in South Carolina's flesh where the peach trees stood sentinel over the quiet fields. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World the sign declared, weather-worn and proud in its proclamation, though the words meant little now to the scattered souls who dwelled there.\n\nFields stretched out beyond sight, broken only by metal-roofed houses that squatted far back from the road like wary creatures. The buildings rose two stories tall, some wearing gray shingles that had seen better days, others gleaming metallic against the merciless southern sun that beat down day after day without cease.\n\nIn the heart of it all stood a single stoplight, swaying gentle above the crossroads like some mechanical prophet. Round it clustered the few merchants who remained. Hong Kong, where a single family toiled in silence. Fiesta, where Mexican dreams were served on chipped plates. Gary's, with its burgers that tasted of times past. The pizzeria was gone now, nothing but an empty shell and memories of better days.\n\nMaxwell and Halford's still poured cherry cola like blood into paper cups, and the IGA stood proud but costly, its aisles walked mostly by those too desperate or too tired to make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General thrived like a weed in barren soil, its parking lot never empty, its fluorescent lights burning from dawn till dusk.\n\nThe furniture store, Possibilities, sat squat and determined, its owner's kindness legendary among the townsfolk. Next door, Clark's tended to the animals, washing and cleaning God's creatures with careful hands. The doctors, both for man and beast, kept their distance from town center, as if afraid to witness its slow decay.\n\nOne school remained, Johnston Elementary, standing alone like the last tooth in an old man's mouth. After fifth grade the children vanished to other towns, as if drawn away by some invisible tide. They spoke of parks to come, two and a half acres of hope they said would bring new life. But for now the town slept, quiet and still, so small you might pass through it between heartbeats and never know it was there at all.",
            "The street runs between two highways cutting through Tennessee like twin serpents of black asphalt, bearing their endless procession of machines. More traffic than a man might want but the neighborhood stays quiet enough. Folk dont move much here. They come and they stay or they never come at all. You see them working their yards in the morning light, mechanical beasts chewing down the grass from March till October when the growing finally gives out. We got us a house on the corner. Me and the woman and two girls, eleven and fourteen. We watch them all come and go, know their vehicles like we know our own faces. When something strange rolls through we mark it. \n\nIn winter the children take to sledding down the hill on the side street, their voices carrying thin and cold in the gray air. But winter dont come much anymore. Just a long fall that stretches out like a dying man. The trees stand thick here, remnants of what was before. They drop their leaves in drifts come autumn and we burn them in piles that send sweet smoke into the cooling air. The neighborhood filled with shade and shadow, filtered sunlight making patterns on the ground like old lace.\n\nWe work from the house mostly. Stay close to home. Sometimes we'll cook out back, meat dripping fat onto hot coals, smoke rising up past the deck boards like prayers. The garage sits back behind the house and we dont use the front door much except when strangers come calling, which they rarely do. I work on my truck there sometimes, doors standing open to the street, listening to the sounds of living filter in. Children on their bikes. Dogs and their people walking slow in the evening light.\n\nHolidays bring the outsiders. Thanksgiving sees strange cars lining the streets like funeral mourners, Christmas the same. Mother's Day too. But mostly its just us here, going about our business in this place we've made our own. If it werent for them highways bracketing us like prison walls, it might be perfect. But perfect aint in the nature of things. Never was.",
            "The desert stretches out endless and brown, nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. Been here since the 90s when houses stood like lonely sentinels in the waste, scattered wide across the emptiness. Different now. The city grows like some manner of concrete vine, spreading its tendrils through what was once open country. Still got space though. Still got that emptiness that makes a man feel small.\n\nOld folk live round here mostly. Decent people. Keep to themselves but wave when you pass. Chain stores dot the landscape like tumbleweeds - Food for Less, Smart and Final. Aint no fancy stores. Have to drive far for them luxuries. Construction crews work endless, building tomorrow's sprawl. Sound of hammers and saws echo across the flats. Sometimes I watch them from my jobsite where I hang drywall and fit metal frames into endless ceilings, wondering how long before the desert disappears completely.\n\nThe wildlife though. That's what keeps a body sane out here. Desert creatures moving through their ancient rituals, paying no mind to the human world growing round them. My young ones spend their days chasing lizards and hunting bugs in the dust, same as children have done since time was young. They understand something pure in that pursuit that grown folks forget.\n\nCounty fair comes through regular. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like a shroud. Down here in the museum they keep pieces of what was - old bones, Indian things, artifacts from when this place was young. Tells the story of how we came to be here, though sometimes I reckon the desert remembers different. Sometimes in the quiet you can hear it speaking its own truth, waiting patient as stone for us all to pass and be forgotten.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland, buildings rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. He reckons it different from what others might call neighborhood. No picket fences here. No children's bicycles abandoned in driveways. Just dormitories and apartments standing sentinel in the gray morning light, their windows dead and watching.\n\nThe buildings themselves come in three forms, each hosting their own breed of dweller. The apartments stand two stories tall, their weathered faces home to twenty souls or thereabouts, packed in like cattle in their narrow rooms. Then there's the houses, old structures scattered about like dice thrown by some careless god, where the alumni make their home. But it's the dormitories that dominate this concrete kingdom, great rectangular monuments stretching toward a colorless sky, hundreds of students stacked one atop the other in rooms barely big enough to hold their dreams.\n\nThe people here are legion, drawn from every corner of the earth like pilgrims to some secular Mecca. Professional staff occupy the houses like minor nobility, while the young ones, fresh-faced and raw, huddle in their dormitory cells. The older students claim the apartments, marking their territory like wolves grown wise to the ways of the pack.\n\nStores dot the landscape like oases in this academic desert. Food joints hawk their wares alongside clothing shops bearing the institution's mark like some tribal totem. A single park exists, a patch of green amid the gray, kept pristine by some unspoken covenant among the inhabitants. Here they gather, these disparate souls, united in their temporary exile from the world beyond.\n\nAt night the buildings loom darker still, their lit windows like dying stars in a manufactured sky. The campus sleeps fitfully, dreaming dreams of purpose and belonging in this strange colony they've built for themselves, this place that is neither home nor foreign land but something in between, something without name or precedent in the world that was.",
            "Ain't no sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it at an angle, our house perched atop what folks call the workout hill on account of them joggers who grunt their way up its spine each morning like pilgrims seeking salvation. People walk the road itself, broken and pitted like the face of some ancient beast. Above them the power lines hang like black rosaries strung between weathered crosses, patched and mended where storms have torn them down time and again.\n\nThe evergreens stand tall and dark against the sky but folk here hate them with a fury reserved for old enemies. They cut them down with machines that scream into the mist, clearing views to the water below. Houses rise up the hillside like great glass-eyed creatures, each one straining above the other to see the bay. At sunset the water burns like molten copper beneath clouds that hang low and gray as widow's veils most days.\n\nThe damp here is a living thing. Moss creeps across every surface like some slow green plague. Left my truck standing a month and found it claimed by that verdant death, took hours to scrape the ghost of it away. No children here save the ones at the schoolhouse down the road. Instead dogs roam like primitive spirits, silent and watching. Found one in my house once, standing there like it owned the place, its eyes yellow in the gloom.\n\nRabbits move through the streets like shadows. Big ones that the gardeners curse and my cats hunt with a terrible patience. Birds too. Little ones that dart quick as thoughts and sometimes the great dark wings of hawks and eagles until the crows drive them off like small black devils protecting their territory.\n\nDown the hill where the land gives way to water there's places that serve up what the bay provides. No beach there but rocks dark as coal that we throw into the gray waters. The far shore stands like a wall through the eternal mist, close enough to mock us with its presence but too far to reach.",
            "He'd tell you Bensonhurst aint hard to find. The trains and buses run there like veins in a dying man's arm, same as they do all over this concrete maze they call New York. Urban and cold and gray but still breathing. Still alive.\n\nThe streets speak Chinese now. Korean too. Twenty years done changed everything. Every block got its Asian stores like teeth in a crooked smile. Supermarkets and laundromats mostly. The locals, they dont mind. Good food cheap and clean clothes, thats what keeps a neighborhood breathing. Where he lived there was four markets within spitting distance. But it wasnt all Asian folk neither. Place was mixed up like spilled paint, immigrants and their american born young ones all living in the same concrete shadow.\n\nThe park they fixed up stood like an oasis in all that stone. Basketball courts lined up like soldiers. Soccer field stretched out dead and brown. Handball walls wearing their history in scuff marks. Children's swings hanging like gallows in the wind. Summer days the water fountain ran like tears while the children played beneath it. All kinds playing together like the world aint taught em to hate yet.\n\nNo towers here. Just boxes stacked for living. Coops and condos but mostly two family houses lined up and down the streets like grave markers. The people were kind enough but lord the noise. Cars screaming past at all hours, music bleeding through walls, engines roaring like wounded beasts in the dark morning.\n\nNight time was different. Night time you kept your eyes moving. Neighborhood was safe enough they said but evil lurks in men's hearts everywhere. He'd been beaten here once, years back. These days thieves took packages right off porches bold as brass. And dog shit everywhere you stepped, like the rules of men meant nothing to these people. City said clean it up but nobody listened. Nobody ever did.\n\nHe'd seen it all change. Seen it die and be reborn. The streets remembered everything even if the people tried to forget.",
            "You got to understand Portland first. What it means to be weird there. Up on that old building that serves everything from pizza to flesh shows, breaking half the laws God ever wrote, there's words painted saying Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say it's a prayer for old times, when the city was cheaper and stranger and bred things that had no name. Others hear it like a calling, like come here and we'll call you weird but mean it kind like a blessing.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their glass towers reaching up into that gray sky but Portland stays weird all the same. Not that weird means kind exactly. Just means tolerating what other places won't abide. We got our modern troubles same as anywhere. Chinese goods in every store. Normal things too like yoga women and men in suits but somehow it all rides lighter here.\n\nIn my part they paint houses like fever dreams. Gardens growing wild right up through the concrete. And them free boxes. Lord the free boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass. Clothes and books mainly but could be anything. Magic in them sometimes. Perfect thing just waiting there for the right soul to find it. That's Portland to me anyway. But I'm just one kind of strange in this strange land.\n\nSome wouldn't touch them sidewalk treasures. They do their bending with goats instead or scream at men kicking balls in rain-soaked fields. Dreams live here. Or maybe just the dreaming of dreams while the beer flows dark and endless. We got our darkness too. Drugs and broken minds beneath them endless clouds. The rain just keeps coming.\n\nThe homeless gather here like birds to seed, drawn by what little mercy we can spare. More than most places offer but never enough. Never enough. The rest of us toggle between pity and hate, same as anywhere else. In that we ain't weird at all. Just human in our failings. Just lost in our own particular way.",
            "The mountains stood there always. North. Like ancient gods bearing witness to the sun's coming and going, day after weary day. A man could forget them in the mundane turns of life but they remained, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of men. And when the weight of living pressed hardest they'd call out silent and demanding to be seen and a man could turn to them and draw from their strength like water from some deep and ageless well. He'd come here first as a boy hardly grown, to the university that sat in their shadow, and they'd claimed him then and there. The campus had its charms sure enough. Fine buildings and trees and ponds that could steal a piece of a man's heart but the mountains they ruled over all like some old testament deity surveying its domain.\n\nThe town spread out below them pretty enough in its way. Coffee houses where young scholars burned midnight oil and filled themselves with bitter drink to ward off sleep. Downtown not far, reachable by foot or by bus, where old brick buildings stood shoulder to shoulder like tired soldiers, their colors faded by time and weather. Here the town showed its other face, citified and bustling, but it didn't last. Past the library the quiet came back like a tide, washing away the noise and the hurry.\n\nThe place held memories like a cup holds water. Good ones and bad ones both. He'd walked past them rusted swings with friends when dawn was breaking after nights spent awake with books and papers. Run through crowded streets to catch pictures at that fancy theater where the university gave out tickets free. But the ponds, they'd seen darker times. Two AM crying jags when existence itself seemed more weight than a soul could bear. He'd watched the turtles and the ducks going about their business, each one knowing its place in the order of things while he searched his own heart for purpose like a man searching a dark room for something lost.\n\nSo he walked. Past pond and park and houses all neat and proper in their suburban rows until he came to the main road. The sun was coming up then, laying its gold across the palm trees, painting the sky in colors that had no names. He was walking north without knowing it and there they were. Always there. The mountains rose up past every building man had raised, touching that yellow-blue dawn sky like something holy. They spoke without words into his heart and gave him the strength to go on.",
            "You wouldnt see it first passing. Just houses behind the stores. Not the kind folks choose willing but the kind they end up in when there aint nowhere else to go. Past the dead Whole Foods and them hotels that stand empty save summer reunions theres a whole world breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like great concrete beasts laid down careful beside each other, sleeping. First ones got trouble written in the papers but we wont speak on that. Truth aint always what gets told.\n\nNext buildings over different though. Different world entire. College across the way. Small campus. Quiet. Students drift in early morning with their coffee cups like ghosts. Iron gates screech their welcome while cars stack up behind, drivers cursing the slow parade of learning.\n\nRoad ends at another. Park on one side. Healing place on the other where broken folk try to mend. Got chairs out front and a fan that just turns and turns in the thick air like it's stirring soup. Children run wild in the park grass, spinning like drunk angels while bees work the flowers dont care about nothing but their business. Old folk walking dogs eye the skateboard kids like they're studying sin itself. Girls bunch up by the swings talking about boys and whatever lights up their phones these days.\n\nStrip mall sits watching it all. Sushi place never full but keeps on. Swimming store. Place for painting nails. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Feed yourself. Fill your pool. Fix your hands. Got one of them yogurt places too where you serve yourself like playing God with toppings. Kids from the park go there. Stand around with their cups sweating in the heat while they blow smoke and try to look like something they aint yet.\n\nThis here's a piece of the old south. Time moves different here. Like molasses in winter. Some things dont need changing. Some things just need leaving be.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels of a forgotten time. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins in the gray light of morning. Small patches of earth they called yards lay before each dwelling and narrow strips of concrete for the automobiles that came and went like mechanical ghosts. They were remnants of some older dream. The American dream they'd called it. It had took hold of the people once but now it was letting go slow and quiet like a dying man's grip.\n\nThe neighborhood persisted. It called out still to those who passed through. Called out in a voice that grew weaker with each season. Folk didn't carry the light in their eyes no more and the yards grew wild where once they'd been kept neat as Sunday clothes. But automobiles still squatted in every drive and the young ones played in the street like there wasnt nothing in the world beyond the block they stood on.\n\nThe school building rose up like some ancient temple. Ninety years it had stood. Ninety years of children passing through its halls dreaming dreams that mostly died before they got born. Churches stood empty now save for dust and memories but the basketball courts rang with life. Each house different from the next yet carrying the same weight of years.\n\nThe market belonged to the Yemen folk. Only Arab family for miles. Most everyone else carried African blood. Wide streets where children played at football and scattered like quail when cars came through. Old folk who'd been there since forever told tales of times when every soul knew every other soul by name.\n\nWhere the karate school had been there was now a pharmacy. Seems folk had decided chemical comfort was worth more than knowing how to fight. The picture show still ran old films at cut rate prices. Young ones stayed away like it carried plague but the elders came regular. Called it a bargain.\n\nThe expressway passed through but didn't stop. Young ones wanted an exit ramp but the elders knew better. Knew that kind of progress was really just decay wearing a fancy suit. New school going up now. They were fixing to pick some kind of mascot. Someone said a cyborg in a log cabin. Like trying to marry tomorrow to yesterday. But maybe that's what the whole place was doing anyway.",
            "The city stretches endless and gray before him, a maze of concrete and steel rising up like the bones of some ancient beast. He watches from his window. Buildings scattered without purpose or meaning between the storefronts and offices that stand like tombstones in the failing light. Restaurants and shops line the streets like desperate mourners, some bearing the marks of corporate ownership while others stand alone, defiant in their independence. The streets wind through it all like dried riverbeds.\n\nParks dot the landscape, small patches of green amid the waste where children still play, their laughter a strange echo in this concrete valley. The people here exist in tribes, each claiming their territory in the urban expanse. The rainbow folk. The orthodox with their black coats and ancient ways. The Russians who fled their homeland carrying memories like stones in their pockets. And beyond, more tribes still. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. All of them separated by mere miles that stretch into hours in the grinding traffic that moves like cold molasses through the arteries of the city.\n\nNobody walks here anymore. They sit sealed in their metal coffins, crawling through the endless congestion, searching for spaces to abandon their vehicles in the vast parking lots that spread like cancer across the land. The city grows despite itself, new towers rising up daily, steel frames reaching toward a sun that rarely breaks through the smog. The old residents watch with dead eyes as more come, always more, drawn to this place like moths to a flame.\n\nHouses stand in varying states of decay and splendor. Some meant for single souls, others stacked like cargo containers, full of bodies pressed together in their separate solitudes. He remembers when he knew his neighbors, when children played in streets that now stand empty save for the occasional passing car. He remembers the girl next door, her face now lost to time, their laughter echoing across summers that exist only in memory. But that world is gone now, replaced by this new reality where strangers pass each other without a glance, each locked in their own private apocalypse.",
            "She looked out at the endless fields and asked where everything was. I told her this was all of it knowing full well how the emptiness would strike her. She'd come from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home and had never known such vastness. The corn stretched out like a dead sea meeting the horizon and I told her what it was to grow up in these parts of Ohio and she knew me then as she hadnt before.\n\nThe quarry water lay black and still beyond the two-lane road that led to where the houses stood. Brick and stucco dwellings each claiming their half acre of god's earth that folk tended like prayer. Come spring the flowers would rise up among the trees that changed their colors like ancient ceremonies. The driveways held German machines that caught the light like mirrors after the washing.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. Always outside. Always singing above his mower's drone like some strange prophet of the grass. Folk smiled at his ways but knew him for what he was. A doctor once. Now just an old man growing older, fading like evening light into the green he tended with his John Deere machine.\n\nOur house stood grey against the sky. Geese moved like pale ghosts across the yard while the terrier gave chase. The stream behind whispered its way to the quarry waters and bullfrogs called into the dusk. Sometimes a cow's moan carried over from the distant farms. Past the wooden bridge we'd built lay a world untouched. Trees and wildflowers and herbs that grew as they pleased. This was my childhood kingdom. We built fortresses in the trees and stalked through the undergrowth playing at hunters. There were always children then. Always someone to share in the dreaming.\n\nWinter came like judgment. The yard that was green turned to emptiness. Trees that had bloomed pink and purple stood naked and black against the gray sky. Snow would come in the night and transform everything. My sister's angels pressed into the white. Snowmen rose up like sentinels. We warred with packed snow, building walls of ice and branch to shelter our arsenal. In that frozen realm we played at life while life played at us, unknowing and uncaring of what lay ahead. We were children still. That was all we knew to be."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Here in the heartland where the farms give way to tourist towns there aint no malls nor chain stores nor restaurants with neon signs. Just empty roads stretching out between places. But the water surrounds us like some ancient guardian. Lake Michigan vast and cold to one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other, their waters pure and deep as time itself. Beaches everywhere you might care to walk.\n\nThe houses stand apart from one another like old sentinels. No matching facades here. Each one bearing the marks of years lived and worked, some renewed by careful hands, others wearing their age like medals. Their foundations rise from the earth, visible from the street, dark mouths gaping at passersby. Aluminum siding in every shade God gave permission for, weathered by countless seasons. Yards spread out wide and green where children's dreams take shape in trampolines and wooden towers. Gardens push up through black soil and wire fences pen in creatures both domestic and loved.\n\nThese are the homes of working folk. People who know the weight of a day's labor and the sound of children's feet on wooden stairs. You'll see them out there, the young ones running wild in the street, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs walking their masters, bikes spinning silent wheels. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. Someone's always got meat on the fire, smoke rising in thin blue columns against the sky. Folk wave and nod, knowing smiles passed like currency.\n\nThe grass stays cut and neat, no dead leaves permitted to gather and rot. Everything trimmed and ordered, not from pride but from respect for what's been built here. It aint beautiful in the way that rich folk measure beauty, but it's got something better. Something true. Something that whispers home and safety in the language of ordinary hearts.\n\nThe sheriff's office squats nearby, and the jail beside it like its darker brother. Health department too, all of them within walking distance. The recycling center hums with the business of waste and renewal. Baseball fields echo with tinny voices calling out americana through crackling speakers. Small planes drone overhead like mechanical dragonflies, taking off and landing at the town airport that ain't much more than a strip of concrete.\n\nIce cream can be had by foot, and downtown aint far if you've got the will to walk it. Children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through the heart of what we've built here. It ain't much, measured against the grand scales of cities. But it's something real. Something that endures.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in their ordered rows, each one a mirror of its neighbor, all of them bound by the invisible chains of the homeowners association that ruled here. Not a blade of grass grew wrong. Not a stone lay crooked in the decorative beds. The driveways ran short and clean to the two-car garages that gaped like standardized wounds in the faces of the homes.\n\nThey'd laid fresh concrete on the roads. Black and perfect. No rupture or crack to mar the surface. No history written there. Single story houses mostly though some rose higher, reaching up as if to touch the empty sky. No mailboxes stood at attention before the homes like in other places. Instead they'd gathered them in clusters at the street ends, metal and gleaming, requiring keys like prison cells.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the edge of things, where civilization met the wild lands that still remembered what came before. Swimming pools stood behind gates, their waters blue and cold and dead. Walking trails wound through the spaces between, worn smooth by the passing of countless feet. Old folk mostly dwelt here, their time spent watching from windows, guarding what remained of their ordered world. Some younger ones too, but fewer, as if the place preferred its inhabitants gray and quiet.\n\nThe city spread beyond, vast in its way but carrying still some remnant of smaller days. One mall stood like a monument to commerce, neither grand nor mean, serving its purpose without ceremony. Fifteen minutes drive through the gathering sprawl would take you to the merchants. They had everything there. Places where the wealthy could buy their clean food, places where the poor could stretch their dollars thin. All of it waiting just beyond the horizon of houses.\n\nThis was a safe place. A clean place. A place where people watched out for their own though they knew not why. The pools lay waiting. The trails wound on. And all of it held together by rules and order and the fear of what chaos might come should the center not hold.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the disappeared. Strange thing to hear of such matters in a district where folk paid thousand-dollar tithes each month just to lay their heads. None I knew had heard these tales neither. Mayhap its the weight of living crushing down. Known some who weep in the nighttime hours when the darkness comes. Things dear now, dearer than before, but we learned the way of less. Come to know the smell of dead mens clothes and broken toys, dust-covered and waiting. The nose grows dull with age. Some take to smoke. Some just forget what clean air tastes like.\n\nThe fleamarket persists like some ancient thing. Smells like magazines yellowed with time stacked on dead pianos. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned. Three houses of the discarded within walking distance. Start at the far end, you can make your way through charity shops, library stacks, rare books and curiosities. Downtown packed tight with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like water but the thrift stores stay quiet as tombs. Good place to lose yourself when the hours stretch long.\n\nEvery year brings more. They say its growing, this city. Home to some great digital empire dealing in wants and needs, still stretching its skin like some young beast. Makes me think on New York. Everyone carrying their own weight, asking nothing. Can keep to yourself here, quiet-like, and none will disturb your peace. Not like down South where concern means care. Here you keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like dark water.\n\nLife moves through it though. Got a piano player next door, singers up above. Less strangers now, more like kin. We gather when needs must, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Found some fortune here maybe. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Keep clean, share food, pass letters back and forth. Good to see them, think they feel the same about me. Living in this great concrete maze but its the people make it feel like home instead of damnation.",
            "The town lies just beyond the reach of the city, a small midwestern place where the edges blur into cornfields and forgotten lots. We live on the east side where the houses stand weathered and gray, paint peeling like old scabs, where folks make do with less than most. Not an ugly place though. People still nod and speak when you pass, their eyes carrying something like hope or maybe just resignation.\n\nThe violence comes and goes like weather. Gunshots sometimes in the night, far off or close, you cant always tell. The neighbors boy got killed outside the tavern last summer. Just another soul gone to whatever waits in the dark. Sometimes things disappear from porches. Small things. Things folks forget to bring inside when night comes.\n\nThe poison that's killing these people aint natural. Fentanyl they call it. It moves through the streets like a ghost taking whoever it wants. The town tries to fight it with clinics and meetings where they teach people how to bring back the dead. Sometimes it works. Mostly it dont.\n\nThe boy goes to school where they feed all the children because hunger dont care about pride. Good people there. They watch over him like he was their own despite whatever's different about him. He comes home happy most days. The school has gatherings where families come together like they used to in the old days, before everything got broken.\n\nThe city men fix up the streets and parks where the money folks live and shop, on the west side where everything shines a little brighter. Our side stays dark. That's just how it is and how it's always been. Been here sixteen years now. The house aint much but it keeps out the rain and holds whatever warmth we can gather. This is our place. Whatever that means. Whatever that's worth.",
            "The neighborhood sits atop the hill like some ancient god's throne, buildings old as sin rising up from streets that remember. Seven stories up I watch the theater across the way, its facade weathered and knowing. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather when the warmth comes, lined up like penitents before some neon shrine, the arcade machines within humming their electric psalms into the night air.\n\nThe park sprawls vast and grey above it all, ringed in concrete and steps that rise like the ribs of some fallen beast. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents arrayed in desperate geometry against the cold. Rain comes biblical and merciless, driving them closer together for what meager warmth bodies can share. They cluster near the family center where steam rises from showers like prayers unanswered.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that makes this place. Aint the proud bones of buildings nor the hills that roll down toward the sea like waves frozen in time. Its the people carrying their stories like scars. Hilltop they called it, bloodiest corner of the western world once. Federal men came through like locusts, DEA badges glinting like false stars. The people remember. Stories pass like dark wine from lip to lip, generation to generation, seeping into transplants like me till we taste the bitter truth of it.\n\nThey tell white folk to stay clear after dark, words carrying the rust of old fears. Maybe its that my skin carries just enough shadow to pass, or maybe the Hill knows its own. Knows them that understand how fear and ignorance breed in the dark corners of a nation that calls itself enlightened.\n\nThe streets know me now. Known me through nights when strangers offered warmth instead of harm. Known me in the laundromat woman's mercy, letting me shelter when the rain came biblical. Known me huddled invisible against storefronts grey as tomb walls, till some passing soul stopped to press paper money in my hand and speak of beauty and worth like some street corner prophet.\n\nThis is my place now. These streets. These people. This hill that rises like truth above the city, bearing its weight of memory and hope into the gunmetal sky.",
            "I came to this place in the late summer before eighth grade commenced, the houses standing like sentinels in the fading light. Two boys lived nearby then, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, though they're gone now, scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. But the memories remain. Most folk who dwelled here when I first arrived still do, their lives as constant as the seasons.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out like any American dream, two-story houses lined up like soldiers at attention. Weekend sounds of children playing drift through the air when the weather turns warm, their voices carrying across empty streets. Quiet rules most days, silence broken only by the occasional passing car or distant lawnmower. Never had no trouble with the people here. They mind their business less you need something, like some unspoken covenant between strangers sharing the same patch of earth.\n\nPackages come and go, untouched on porches like offerings to modern gods. Trust flows easy here, like water in a stream. There's a park nearby, not more than a minute's walk through the trees. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked concrete where we played our games, football too, and baseball when the weather was right. Got my nose broke there once, caught an elbow in a game gone wrong, but the good memories outweigh the bad like gold outweighs lead.\n\nThese days I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them swing and slide like I once did, their joy pure as spring water. The park calls to something deep inside me now, something old and true. The neighborhood's got everything a body could want. Food from all corners of the earth within walking distance - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though most folks now let others bring it to their door through glowing screens and digital prayers.\n\nFast food joints stand on every corner like churches of convenience, and pizza places too, more than you could count. Stores line the streets selling everything from medicine to memories. Two pharmacies face each other across the road like old rivals, a grocery store squats nearby, and there's even a place run by Indian folk where you can find spices that smell like dreams of far-off lands.\n\nSometimes when I read about other neighborhoods, about the darkness that dwells in some places, I know I've been blessed. This place ain't perfect, nothing is in this world, but it's mine and I reckon that's enough.",
            "The college stands near where I live, a blessing or curse depending on the day. Apartment buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a godless sky, their facades weathered and old as sin itself. Between them crouch the bars and eateries where students gather like pilgrims at some forsaken shrine. The new bar they renamed stands prouder than the rest, demanding more coin for the same spirits that flow through all vessels.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes - the young scholars and the poor souls trapped by circumstance in these cheap dwellings. Children too, countless small figures moving in packs near the elementary school that squats at the edge of sight. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how it shall stay, though their constant burning of the devil's weed forced management to mount some plastic contraption that spews artificial freshness into the stale hallway. A joke told in plastic and chemicals.\n\nNew buildings rise down the street, false prophets built of cardboard and promises, charging gold for quarters made of straw. The cheap diner serves its meals on paper like some dystopian soup kitchen, microwaving sustenance for the masses. The gas station stands sentinel, a place where hope goes to die on minimum wage.\n\nThe city's money brought new concrete and grass, as if nature could be purchased and planted like fence posts. Trees shadow my building, their stumps testament to those already fallen. Behind lies 43rd street, a darker reflection of our own, where broken sidewalks tell tales of neglect and crime breeds in the shadows of shabby buildings hidden behind green curtains of leaves.\n\nYet I remain, for the price suits my purse and the university lies within walking distance. The buses come and go like mechanical pilgrims, carrying their human cargo to stores and downtown streets. This is my station now, this purgatory of students and survivors, of concrete and leaves, of hope and decay all mixed together like ash in the wind.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the failing light, white porches stark against the metal roofs green as cedar water. A cul-de-sac where folk gather in the graying dusk, speaking low words that carry on the evening air while young ones mark the concrete with colored chalk or chase their kites against the dimming sky. Like some forgotten time returned. Some ancient memory of how things was.\n\nFields stretch beyond where we stand, trees rising up black against blue skies scattered with clouds white as bone. But the weather turns cruel here. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark like some mechanical banshee and folk scattered to their holes. Found myself crouched in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever vestments of civilization seemed worth saving while the big dog prowled the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own knuckles rapping judgment on the roof.\n\nWhen it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cold, temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five like a stone dropped in deep water. The hail melted where it struck the blacktop still holding the day's heat. Then the sun broke through and the rain came again and there above it all hung twin rainbows like some celestial gateway. Took pictures quick as I could though nothing captured in a box could hold such glory.\n\nThe streets stayed quiet a while longer, folk emerging slow like survivors of some great catastrophe, then life returned as it always does. Women and children gathering while supper cooked in their ovens, talk drifting on the cooling air. Different here from New Hampshire, the voices soft and stretched like warm taffy in the southern way.\n\nBehind the houses lies a field where deer pass silent as smoke and beyond that a pond where no one swims. Mornings the bullfrog sings his ancient song like something left over from the time before time. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world entire. Roosters call across the dawn from hidden farms and in the evening a donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding some artifact of older days, some remnant of what the world was before the world forgot itself.",
            "Ten years in this place. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. First time we come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept like a child though I was one then. Mama and daddy said it was for the better. Better schools. Better houses. Better everything they said. No more ghetto they said. Words dont make a home but time does.\n\nYears passed like wind through dead grass. Made friends. Made enemies too. Neighbors stayed strangers except for Mr Glen and Dennis living next door. Good folk. Almost like blood how close we got. Remember Mr Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him getting hitched again. Whole family went. Mama daddy sister and me watching them dance. Ms Veda in her white dress throwing that little leg strap. Caught it in my hands like a sign. Didnt catch no flowers though. Danced with Marsharii that night. Aint seen her since. Time takes everything.\n\nNeighborhood's like some maze God laid down. Got GPS now but back then just wandered. Went far as I dared with Kason and Curtis. Playing them games. Living like time would never end. Sometimes I go to the park now. Just to be. Just to breathe. Take them sticks from Home Depot. Practice balance like some old warrior monk. Bring my wooden sword too sometimes. Tennis courts and basketball hoops standing empty like grave markers. Aint played in years. Daddy and Mr Graves taught us tennis when we was young. Worked us hard in that summer heat but we smiled through it.\n\nMemory's a kind of cage. Holds all them good times. All them stories. But the best ones aint been lived yet. They're out there waiting in the dark like wolves. Waiting for their time to come.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, settled deep in South Carolina's flesh where the peach trees stood sentinel over the quiet fields. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World the sign declared, weather-worn and proud in its proclamation, though the words meant little now to the scattered souls who dwelled there.\n\nFields stretched out beyond sight, broken only by metal-roofed houses that squatted far back from the road like wary creatures. The buildings rose two stories tall, some wearing gray shingles that had seen better days, others gleaming metallic against the merciless southern sun that beat down day after day without cease.\n\nIn the heart of it all stood a single stoplight, swaying gentle above the crossroads like some mechanical prophet. Round it clustered the few merchants who remained. Hong Kong, where a single family toiled in silence. Fiesta, where Mexican dreams were served on chipped plates. Gary's, with its burgers that tasted of times past. The pizzeria was gone now, nothing but an empty shell and memories of better days.\n\nMaxwell and Halford's still poured cherry cola like blood into paper cups, and the IGA stood proud but costly, its aisles walked mostly by those too desperate or too tired to make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General thrived like a weed in barren soil, its parking lot never empty, its fluorescent lights burning from dawn till dusk.\n\nThe furniture store, Possibilities, sat squat and determined, its owner's kindness legendary among the townsfolk. Next door, Clark's tended to the animals, washing and cleaning God's creatures with careful hands. The doctors, both for man and beast, kept their distance from town center, as if afraid to witness its slow decay.\n\nOne school remained, Johnston Elementary, standing alone like the last tooth in an old man's mouth. After fifth grade the children vanished to other towns, as if drawn away by some invisible tide. They spoke of parks to come, two and a half acres of hope they said would bring new life. But for now the town slept, quiet and still, so small you might pass through it between heartbeats and never know it was there at all.",
            "The street runs between two highways cutting through Tennessee like twin serpents of black asphalt, bearing their endless procession of machines. More traffic than a man might want but the neighborhood stays quiet enough. Folk dont move much here. They come and they stay or they never come at all. You see them working their yards in the morning light, mechanical beasts chewing down the grass from March till October when the growing finally gives out. We got us a house on the corner. Me and the woman and two girls, eleven and fourteen. We watch them all come and go, know their vehicles like we know our own faces. When something strange rolls through we mark it. \n\nIn winter the children take to sledding down the hill on the side street, their voices carrying thin and cold in the gray air. But winter dont come much anymore. Just a long fall that stretches out like a dying man. The trees stand thick here, remnants of what was before. They drop their leaves in drifts come autumn and we burn them in piles that send sweet smoke into the cooling air. The neighborhood filled with shade and shadow, filtered sunlight making patterns on the ground like old lace.\n\nWe work from the house mostly. Stay close to home. Sometimes we'll cook out back, meat dripping fat onto hot coals, smoke rising up past the deck boards like prayers. The garage sits back behind the house and we dont use the front door much except when strangers come calling, which they rarely do. I work on my truck there sometimes, doors standing open to the street, listening to the sounds of living filter in. Children on their bikes. Dogs and their people walking slow in the evening light.\n\nHolidays bring the outsiders. Thanksgiving sees strange cars lining the streets like funeral mourners, Christmas the same. Mother's Day too. But mostly its just us here, going about our business in this place we've made our own. If it werent for them highways bracketing us like prison walls, it might be perfect. But perfect aint in the nature of things. Never was.",
            "The desert stretches out endless and brown, nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. Been here since the 90s when houses stood like lonely sentinels in the waste, scattered wide across the emptiness. Different now. The city grows like some manner of concrete vine, spreading its tendrils through what was once open country. Still got space though. Still got that emptiness that makes a man feel small.\n\nOld folk live round here mostly. Decent people. Keep to themselves but wave when you pass. Chain stores dot the landscape like tumbleweeds - Food for Less, Smart and Final. Aint no fancy stores. Have to drive far for them luxuries. Construction crews work endless, building tomorrow's sprawl. Sound of hammers and saws echo across the flats. Sometimes I watch them from my jobsite where I hang drywall and fit metal frames into endless ceilings, wondering how long before the desert disappears completely.\n\nThe wildlife though. That's what keeps a body sane out here. Desert creatures moving through their ancient rituals, paying no mind to the human world growing round them. My young ones spend their days chasing lizards and hunting bugs in the dust, same as children have done since time was young. They understand something pure in that pursuit that grown folks forget.\n\nCounty fair comes through regular. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like a shroud. Down here in the museum they keep pieces of what was - old bones, Indian things, artifacts from when this place was young. Tells the story of how we came to be here, though sometimes I reckon the desert remembers different. Sometimes in the quiet you can hear it speaking its own truth, waiting patient as stone for us all to pass and be forgotten.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland, buildings rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. He reckons it different from what others might call neighborhood. No picket fences here. No children's bicycles abandoned in driveways. Just dormitories and apartments standing sentinel in the gray morning light, their windows dead and watching.\n\nThe buildings themselves come in three forms, each hosting their own breed of dweller. The apartments stand two stories tall, their weathered faces home to twenty souls or thereabouts, packed in like cattle in their narrow rooms. Then there's the houses, old structures scattered about like dice thrown by some careless god, where the alumni make their home. But it's the dormitories that dominate this concrete kingdom, great rectangular monuments stretching toward a colorless sky, hundreds of students stacked one atop the other in rooms barely big enough to hold their dreams.\n\nThe people here are legion, drawn from every corner of the earth like pilgrims to some secular Mecca. Professional staff occupy the houses like minor nobility, while the young ones, fresh-faced and raw, huddle in their dormitory cells. The older students claim the apartments, marking their territory like wolves grown wise to the ways of the pack.\n\nStores dot the landscape like oases in this academic desert. Food joints hawk their wares alongside clothing shops bearing the institution's mark like some tribal totem. A single park exists, a patch of green amid the gray, kept pristine by some unspoken covenant among the inhabitants. Here they gather, these disparate souls, united in their temporary exile from the world beyond.\n\nAt night the buildings loom darker still, their lit windows like dying stars in a manufactured sky. The campus sleeps fitfully, dreaming dreams of purpose and belonging in this strange colony they've built for themselves, this place that is neither home nor foreign land but something in between, something without name or precedent in the world that was.",
            "Ain't no sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it at an angle, our house perched atop what folks call the workout hill on account of them joggers who grunt their way up its spine each morning like pilgrims seeking salvation. People walk the road itself, broken and pitted like the face of some ancient beast. Above them the power lines hang like black rosaries strung between weathered crosses, patched and mended where storms have torn them down time and again.\n\nThe evergreens stand tall and dark against the sky but folk here hate them with a fury reserved for old enemies. They cut them down with machines that scream into the mist, clearing views to the water below. Houses rise up the hillside like great glass-eyed creatures, each one straining above the other to see the bay. At sunset the water burns like molten copper beneath clouds that hang low and gray as widow's veils most days.\n\nThe damp here is a living thing. Moss creeps across every surface like some slow green plague. Left my truck standing a month and found it claimed by that verdant death, took hours to scrape the ghost of it away. No children here save the ones at the schoolhouse down the road. Instead dogs roam like primitive spirits, silent and watching. Found one in my house once, standing there like it owned the place, its eyes yellow in the gloom.\n\nRabbits move through the streets like shadows. Big ones that the gardeners curse and my cats hunt with a terrible patience. Birds too. Little ones that dart quick as thoughts and sometimes the great dark wings of hawks and eagles until the crows drive them off like small black devils protecting their territory.\n\nDown the hill where the land gives way to water there's places that serve up what the bay provides. No beach there but rocks dark as coal that we throw into the gray waters. The far shore stands like a wall through the eternal mist, close enough to mock us with its presence but too far to reach.",
            "He'd tell you Bensonhurst aint hard to find. The trains and buses run there like veins in a dying man's arm, same as they do all over this concrete maze they call New York. Urban and cold and gray but still breathing. Still alive.\n\nThe streets speak Chinese now. Korean too. Twenty years done changed everything. Every block got its Asian stores like teeth in a crooked smile. Supermarkets and laundromats mostly. The locals, they dont mind. Good food cheap and clean clothes, thats what keeps a neighborhood breathing. Where he lived there was four markets within spitting distance. But it wasnt all Asian folk neither. Place was mixed up like spilled paint, immigrants and their american born young ones all living in the same concrete shadow.\n\nThe park they fixed up stood like an oasis in all that stone. Basketball courts lined up like soldiers. Soccer field stretched out dead and brown. Handball walls wearing their history in scuff marks. Children's swings hanging like gallows in the wind. Summer days the water fountain ran like tears while the children played beneath it. All kinds playing together like the world aint taught em to hate yet.\n\nNo towers here. Just boxes stacked for living. Coops and condos but mostly two family houses lined up and down the streets like grave markers. The people were kind enough but lord the noise. Cars screaming past at all hours, music bleeding through walls, engines roaring like wounded beasts in the dark morning.\n\nNight time was different. Night time you kept your eyes moving. Neighborhood was safe enough they said but evil lurks in men's hearts everywhere. He'd been beaten here once, years back. These days thieves took packages right off porches bold as brass. And dog shit everywhere you stepped, like the rules of men meant nothing to these people. City said clean it up but nobody listened. Nobody ever did.\n\nHe'd seen it all change. Seen it die and be reborn. The streets remembered everything even if the people tried to forget.",
            "You got to understand Portland first. What it means to be weird there. Up on that old building that serves everything from pizza to flesh shows, breaking half the laws God ever wrote, there's words painted saying Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say it's a prayer for old times, when the city was cheaper and stranger and bred things that had no name. Others hear it like a calling, like come here and we'll call you weird but mean it kind like a blessing.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their glass towers reaching up into that gray sky but Portland stays weird all the same. Not that weird means kind exactly. Just means tolerating what other places won't abide. We got our modern troubles same as anywhere. Chinese goods in every store. Normal things too like yoga women and men in suits but somehow it all rides lighter here.\n\nIn my part they paint houses like fever dreams. Gardens growing wild right up through the concrete. And them free boxes. Lord the free boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass. Clothes and books mainly but could be anything. Magic in them sometimes. Perfect thing just waiting there for the right soul to find it. That's Portland to me anyway. But I'm just one kind of strange in this strange land.\n\nSome wouldn't touch them sidewalk treasures. They do their bending with goats instead or scream at men kicking balls in rain-soaked fields. Dreams live here. Or maybe just the dreaming of dreams while the beer flows dark and endless. We got our darkness too. Drugs and broken minds beneath them endless clouds. The rain just keeps coming.\n\nThe homeless gather here like birds to seed, drawn by what little mercy we can spare. More than most places offer but never enough. Never enough. The rest of us toggle between pity and hate, same as anywhere else. In that we ain't weird at all. Just human in our failings. Just lost in our own particular way.",
            "The mountains stood there always. North. Like ancient gods bearing witness to the sun's coming and going, day after weary day. A man could forget them in the mundane turns of life but they remained, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of men. And when the weight of living pressed hardest they'd call out silent and demanding to be seen and a man could turn to them and draw from their strength like water from some deep and ageless well. He'd come here first as a boy hardly grown, to the university that sat in their shadow, and they'd claimed him then and there. The campus had its charms sure enough. Fine buildings and trees and ponds that could steal a piece of a man's heart but the mountains they ruled over all like some old testament deity surveying its domain.\n\nThe town spread out below them pretty enough in its way. Coffee houses where young scholars burned midnight oil and filled themselves with bitter drink to ward off sleep. Downtown not far, reachable by foot or by bus, where old brick buildings stood shoulder to shoulder like tired soldiers, their colors faded by time and weather. Here the town showed its other face, citified and bustling, but it didn't last. Past the library the quiet came back like a tide, washing away the noise and the hurry.\n\nThe place held memories like a cup holds water. Good ones and bad ones both. He'd walked past them rusted swings with friends when dawn was breaking after nights spent awake with books and papers. Run through crowded streets to catch pictures at that fancy theater where the university gave out tickets free. But the ponds, they'd seen darker times. Two AM crying jags when existence itself seemed more weight than a soul could bear. He'd watched the turtles and the ducks going about their business, each one knowing its place in the order of things while he searched his own heart for purpose like a man searching a dark room for something lost.\n\nSo he walked. Past pond and park and houses all neat and proper in their suburban rows until he came to the main road. The sun was coming up then, laying its gold across the palm trees, painting the sky in colors that had no names. He was walking north without knowing it and there they were. Always there. The mountains rose up past every building man had raised, touching that yellow-blue dawn sky like something holy. They spoke without words into his heart and gave him the strength to go on.",
            "You wouldnt see it first passing. Just houses behind the stores. Not the kind folks choose willing but the kind they end up in when there aint nowhere else to go. Past the dead Whole Foods and them hotels that stand empty save summer reunions theres a whole world breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like great concrete beasts laid down careful beside each other, sleeping. First ones got trouble written in the papers but we wont speak on that. Truth aint always what gets told.\n\nNext buildings over different though. Different world entire. College across the way. Small campus. Quiet. Students drift in early morning with their coffee cups like ghosts. Iron gates screech their welcome while cars stack up behind, drivers cursing the slow parade of learning.\n\nRoad ends at another. Park on one side. Healing place on the other where broken folk try to mend. Got chairs out front and a fan that just turns and turns in the thick air like it's stirring soup. Children run wild in the park grass, spinning like drunk angels while bees work the flowers dont care about nothing but their business. Old folk walking dogs eye the skateboard kids like they're studying sin itself. Girls bunch up by the swings talking about boys and whatever lights up their phones these days.\n\nStrip mall sits watching it all. Sushi place never full but keeps on. Swimming store. Place for painting nails. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Feed yourself. Fill your pool. Fix your hands. Got one of them yogurt places too where you serve yourself like playing God with toppings. Kids from the park go there. Stand around with their cups sweating in the heat while they blow smoke and try to look like something they aint yet.\n\nThis here's a piece of the old south. Time moves different here. Like molasses in winter. Some things dont need changing. Some things just need leaving be.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels of a forgotten time. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins in the gray light of morning. Small patches of earth they called yards lay before each dwelling and narrow strips of concrete for the automobiles that came and went like mechanical ghosts. They were remnants of some older dream. The American dream they'd called it. It had took hold of the people once but now it was letting go slow and quiet like a dying man's grip.\n\nThe neighborhood persisted. It called out still to those who passed through. Called out in a voice that grew weaker with each season. Folk didn't carry the light in their eyes no more and the yards grew wild where once they'd been kept neat as Sunday clothes. But automobiles still squatted in every drive and the young ones played in the street like there wasnt nothing in the world beyond the block they stood on.\n\nThe school building rose up like some ancient temple. Ninety years it had stood. Ninety years of children passing through its halls dreaming dreams that mostly died before they got born. Churches stood empty now save for dust and memories but the basketball courts rang with life. Each house different from the next yet carrying the same weight of years.\n\nThe market belonged to the Yemen folk. Only Arab family for miles. Most everyone else carried African blood. Wide streets where children played at football and scattered like quail when cars came through. Old folk who'd been there since forever told tales of times when every soul knew every other soul by name.\n\nWhere the karate school had been there was now a pharmacy. Seems folk had decided chemical comfort was worth more than knowing how to fight. The picture show still ran old films at cut rate prices. Young ones stayed away like it carried plague but the elders came regular. Called it a bargain.\n\nThe expressway passed through but didn't stop. Young ones wanted an exit ramp but the elders knew better. Knew that kind of progress was really just decay wearing a fancy suit. New school going up now. They were fixing to pick some kind of mascot. Someone said a cyborg in a log cabin. Like trying to marry tomorrow to yesterday. But maybe that's what the whole place was doing anyway.",
            "The city stretches endless and gray before him, a maze of concrete and steel rising up like the bones of some ancient beast. He watches from his window. Buildings scattered without purpose or meaning between the storefronts and offices that stand like tombstones in the failing light. Restaurants and shops line the streets like desperate mourners, some bearing the marks of corporate ownership while others stand alone, defiant in their independence. The streets wind through it all like dried riverbeds.\n\nParks dot the landscape, small patches of green amid the waste where children still play, their laughter a strange echo in this concrete valley. The people here exist in tribes, each claiming their territory in the urban expanse. The rainbow folk. The orthodox with their black coats and ancient ways. The Russians who fled their homeland carrying memories like stones in their pockets. And beyond, more tribes still. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. All of them separated by mere miles that stretch into hours in the grinding traffic that moves like cold molasses through the arteries of the city.\n\nNobody walks here anymore. They sit sealed in their metal coffins, crawling through the endless congestion, searching for spaces to abandon their vehicles in the vast parking lots that spread like cancer across the land. The city grows despite itself, new towers rising up daily, steel frames reaching toward a sun that rarely breaks through the smog. The old residents watch with dead eyes as more come, always more, drawn to this place like moths to a flame.\n\nHouses stand in varying states of decay and splendor. Some meant for single souls, others stacked like cargo containers, full of bodies pressed together in their separate solitudes. He remembers when he knew his neighbors, when children played in streets that now stand empty save for the occasional passing car. He remembers the girl next door, her face now lost to time, their laughter echoing across summers that exist only in memory. But that world is gone now, replaced by this new reality where strangers pass each other without a glance, each locked in their own private apocalypse.",
            "She looked out at the endless fields and asked where everything was. I told her this was all of it knowing full well how the emptiness would strike her. She'd come from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home and had never known such vastness. The corn stretched out like a dead sea meeting the horizon and I told her what it was to grow up in these parts of Ohio and she knew me then as she hadnt before.\n\nThe quarry water lay black and still beyond the two-lane road that led to where the houses stood. Brick and stucco dwellings each claiming their half acre of god's earth that folk tended like prayer. Come spring the flowers would rise up among the trees that changed their colors like ancient ceremonies. The driveways held German machines that caught the light like mirrors after the washing.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. Always outside. Always singing above his mower's drone like some strange prophet of the grass. Folk smiled at his ways but knew him for what he was. A doctor once. Now just an old man growing older, fading like evening light into the green he tended with his John Deere machine.\n\nOur house stood grey against the sky. Geese moved like pale ghosts across the yard while the terrier gave chase. The stream behind whispered its way to the quarry waters and bullfrogs called into the dusk. Sometimes a cow's moan carried over from the distant farms. Past the wooden bridge we'd built lay a world untouched. Trees and wildflowers and herbs that grew as they pleased. This was my childhood kingdom. We built fortresses in the trees and stalked through the undergrowth playing at hunters. There were always children then. Always someone to share in the dreaming.\n\nWinter came like judgment. The yard that was green turned to emptiness. Trees that had bloomed pink and purple stood naked and black against the gray sky. Snow would come in the night and transform everything. My sister's angels pressed into the white. Snowmen rose up like sentinels. We warred with packed snow, building walls of ice and branch to shelter our arsenal. In that frozen realm we played at life while life played at us, unknowing and uncaring of what lay ahead. We were children still. That was all we knew to be."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Small town Michigan where the farmland bleeds into tourist towns like blood seeping through gauze. Aint no malls here. No Walmart. No chain restaurants with their neon signs burning holes in the night. Everything's a drive. But Lord if it aint beautiful, this water-blessed land. My piece of earth sits between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix like a child between two vast mothers. Water everywhere you turn. Always some shore waiting to swallow your feet.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks of small places, of lives lived close to the ground. Houses stand apart from each other like stubborn old men, each one different, each one carrying its years in its own way. Some got new faces, others wear their age plain. Most got basements you can see from the road, like bones showing through worn skin. Aluminum siding gone gray and weary on many. Colors everywhere though, like God himself couldn't make up his mind.\n\nYards stretch out wild and lived-in. Trampolines standing like black metal insects. Garden plots where folks work the earth with their hands. Fences holding dogs and memories. These houses, they hold Middle America. Working folk who wake up tired and go to bed tired and somewhere in between raise up their young.\n\nChildren run these streets like water. Dogs and bikes and roller skates. Neighbors know each other's shadows. They can smell a stranger. Folk grilling in their yards raise a hand to passersby, dog walkers nod like old friends. The grass stays cut, the bushes trimmed, leaves dont linger come autumn. Aint beautiful like them magazine neighborhoods, but its good. Safe. The kind of place where you can lay your head down at night and know your children sleep easy.\n\nSheriff's office sits close enough to walk to. Health department too. Recycling center down the way where trucks come and go like mechanical pilgrims. Baseball fields echo with voices calling names into the evening air. Small planes growl overhead from the town airport, their engines speaking in tongues only pilots know. Ice cream place is walking distance. Downtown too if your legs are willing. Children can ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through these quiet streets where everyone knows everyone and the water's always waiting at the edge of town.\n\nThis is my place. This is where we are.",
            "The houses stood like grave markers in that suburban waste. Row after row of them identical and mute beneath the scorching sun. No character to speak of save what the homeowners association deemed fit in their godless pursuit of uniformity. Each yard a mirror of the last. Small patches of grass maintained with religious fervor and decorative stone scattered like the bones of some ancient thing and driveways too short for any proper use. Trees stood dwarfed and regulated, testimony to man's desire to control even nature herself.\n\nThe concrete roads stretched pristine and perfect through the development, unmarred by time or wear as if laid down yesterday though they weren't. No mailboxes stood sentry before the homes like in times past. Instead they'd built communal boxes at the street's end, all locked away behind cold metal doors with two larger chambers for packages, as if the very act of mail delivery needed to be sanitized and controlled.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the city's edge where suburbia met the wild lands in an uneasy truce. They'd built pools there, gated and watched, and walking trails that wound through what remained of the natural world. Retired folk mostly inhabited these parts now, with some younger professionals mixed in like pepper in salt. They watched each other with practiced vigilance, each serving as the other's keeper in this manufactured paradise.\n\nThe city itself sprawled vast but retained something of its small-town heart, like a child trying on its father's clothes. One mall stood testament to progress, neither grand nor humble but sufficient to its purpose. Fifteen minutes drive in any direction would take you to the temples of commerce - stores high and low, from the organic sanctuaries of the wealthy to the bare-bones outlets where the poor sought sustenance.\n\nThe whole of it lay there beneath the empty sky, safe and maintained and typical as a dream. A place where even chaos had been ordered into submission, where wildness had been tamed and packaged for consumption. Where you could drive your car to any chain store your heart desired, so long as you were willing to trade fifteen minutes of your life to get there.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the missing. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more each month to inhabit and none had spoken of such tales before. Not my companions nor any other soul. Perhaps it's the weight of living that silences them. Some nights you can hear them weeping through the walls, my friends, crushed under the burden of survival. Time teaches you to live lean. You learn to love the scent of secondhand things, those castoff toys and clothes wrapped in time's shroud. The nose grows dull with age. Some take to tobacco. Others just forget what clean truly meant.\n\nBut the markets of the poor persist. They smell of adulthood itself, like magazines gone yellow atop a piano that ain't been opened in years. The smell works its way into leather and stays, defying soap and water both. Three such stores stand within walking distance. Starting from the far end you can make your pilgrimage through two charity shops, past the library, through a place that trades in rare books, ending at the curiosity shop. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but them shops stay quiet as tombs. Silent sanctuaries where afternoon light dies slow.\n\nYear by year the city grows fat with cars and bodies. They call it development. Some great digital empire made its throne here, and the city groans with growing pains like New York before it. Everyone carries their own purpose here, asks nothing of nobody. A man can wrap himself in solitude and none will try to pierce that shell. Not like down South where concern passes for caring. Here the city breaks against you like waves on stone and recedes just the same.\n\nLife moves through the walls. A pianist dwells next door, two would-be singers above. Less strangers sharing walls than a fellowship of sorts. We come together in need, mark births and deaths alike, extend help when we can. Fortune smiled on me in this. My neighbors treat me kindly and I do the same. I mind my mess and share my food and they return the gesture. We pass letters between us like sacred things. I've made my home in this concrete labyrinth but it's them that makes it bearable. Makes me think I ain't ruined everything after all.",
            "The town lies just beyond the reach of the city, a small midwestern place where the wind carries stories of better days. On the east side where we dwell the houses stand weathered and wanting, their paint peeling like old scabs, rented or bought by those who carry little in their pockets save hope and copper pennies. But there aint no ugliness here. The people nod and speak when you pass. They remember what courtesy means in a world that's forgotten.\n\nThe violence comes sometimes like a thief in the night. Gunshots echo in the darkness. People disappear. The neighbors lost their boy outside a bar last year, his blood soaking into cracked pavement while music played inside. We've been spared such grief save for the occasional taking of things left too long on the porch, like offerings to hungry ghosts.\n\nThe poison that men call fentanyl has worked its way through the veins of this town like a slow cancer. Bodies stack up in the morgue while the living learn to push needles of salvation into dying flesh. Narcan they call it. A resurrection in a bottle.\n\nThe boy goes to school where good people still work at being good. Special needs, they say, but he aint never been treated as less than whole. The teachers remember what kindness means. They feed all the children here, knowing hunger dont care about pride. Twenty percent below the poverty line, the numbers say, but numbers dont tell about the heart of things.\n\nThe city men work their improvements in the center of town and the west side where the money flows. Fresh pavement, new trees, parks where children play. But the east side waits like a forgotten child, watching its brothers get new shoes while its own feet stay bare.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint worth much in dollars but it keeps out the rain and holds our memories. The people here they get by. They remember what community means. Sometimes at night I stand on the porch and listen to the town breathing, all its broken dreams and stubborn hopes rising up like smoke from chimneys in winter. This is home. There aint no other place we'd rather be.",
            "The neighborhood set upon the hill like some ancient fortress, buildings standing sentinel with their histories etched deep in mortar and stone. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater stands dark and brooding, its marquee dead these many years. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather when the warmth comes, an arcade where beer flows and laughter echoes against brick walls. Lines of them standing patient in the summer dark, waiting their turn at whatever salvation lies within.\n\nThe park spreads vast above it all, ringed in concrete like the walls of some forgotten coliseum. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents lined neat as gravestones along the steps where the rain beats its endless dirge. They huddle close, these wanderers, seeking warmth in numbers, closer to where mercy flows from shower heads and soap dispensers in the family center down below.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks to me, nor them proud buildings reaching toward whatever god might still be watching. It's the people carrying their histories like scars. Hilltop, they called it, when blood ran in gutters and federal men swept through like locusts, badges glinting, taking what they would. Stories pass like scripture now, whispered in doorways, told to newcomers like me who came seeking something real.\n\nWhite folk dont walk these streets after dark, they say, though that warning rings hollow as an old church bell, echoing from days when fear ruled these blocks. Maybe its that my skin carries enough shadow to pass, or maybe the Hill sees in me what it sees in itself - the weight of old wounds, the knowing that fear and ignorance still poison the well we all drink from.\n\nThese streets know me now. They've sheltered me when rain fell like judgment. Seen me huddled against concrete while strangers passed carrying kindness like lanterns in the dark. Five dollars pressed into a cold palm, words of worth spoken soft as prayer. The Hill claims its own, and I am claimed, marked by this place where laundromat lights burn late for them that need charging, where jackets appear like miracles on cold shoulders.\n\nThis is home. These streets. These people. This history written in brick and blood and mercy. The Hill abides, and I abide with it.",
            "When I came to this place I was just a boy, not yet fourteen, the houses standing like sentinels in the dull August heat. Making friends dont come easy to a boy that age but there was two others lived close by, one two doors down and another somewhere along that same street. They're gone now but the memories aint. Most that was here then is here still. Houses like you'd see anywhere in this country, two stories high with vinyl siding gone gray in the weather, pressed together like old friends sharing secrets. Summer weekends you can hear the children, their voices carrying across yards gone brown in the heat, their laughter echoing off aluminum gutters and chain link fences.\n\nQuiet mostly. The kind of quiet that speaks to something deeper than just the absence of sound. Folk here mind their own unless there's need otherwise. Packages come and stay where they're left. Trust aint something you find easy these days but here it remains like some relic of an older time.\n\nThe park sits just beyond where the houses end. Basketball courts where the asphalt's cracked and weeds push through. Football fields where blood was spilled, my own once when some boy's elbow found my nose. But that aint what I remember most. What I remember is the good times, times that seem now like they belonged to someone else. These days I take my cousin's young ones there. Watch them on the swings, their legs pumping at the sky like they might touch it if they just try hard enough.\n\nThe streets here are a patchwork of cultures pressed together like pages in an old book. Chinese food and Mexican. Indian spices carrying on the wind. Italian too. Most folk now they just press buttons on their phones and food appears like magic at their doors. Fast food mostly, pizza too. All the stores a body could need. Cleaners where shirts hang like pale ghosts in windows. Drug stores facing each other across the street like gunslingers. Grocery stores with their fluorescent glow spilling onto empty parking lots at night. Even got an Indian store where spices sit in glass jars like jewels.\n\nWhen I hear tell of other places, neighborhoods where folk cant trust their own shadow, I know what we got here is something rare. Something worth holding onto. Like finding water in a desert, or truth in a world gone mad with lies.",
            "The college loomed beyond the treeline, a concrete sentinel watching over streets that held no memory of better days. The apartment buildings stood like weathered tombstones, their facades grayed and peeling in the filtered sunlight. Forty-second street lay before him like a promise, newly paved, the sidewalks clean and wide, but behind it forty-third crouched in shadow, its concrete broken and heaved up like the bones of something long dead.\n\nHe walked past the bars where students gathered, their laughter carrying across empty lots where weeds pushed through cracked asphalt. The new place charged more now, but they all did. Money was just paper anyway, worthless as the leaves that skittered across the fresh-laid sod between road and walk.\n\nThe air was thick with smoke. Not tobacco but that sweet cloying scent that seeped from beneath his neighbors' door. Management had mounted their plastic defense against it, a small box that wheezed out artificial spring. A joke if there ever was one.\n\nBehind the buildings the trees stood sentinel, their branches reaching like gnarled fingers over rooftops. Some had been cut, their stumps testament to man's constant war with nature. Beyond them lay forty-third street where the shadows grew longer and darker, where sirens wailed more often in the night. The buildings there wore their decay like a shroud, their windows staring blind and empty at passersby.\n\nThe new apartments down the way were false prophets, pretty shells built quick and cheap, drawing in the faithful with promises their thin walls couldn't keep. The restaurant across served microwaved dreams on paper plates, and the gas station's fluorescent lights cast their sickly glow over minimum wage desperation.\n\nBut it was home. The buses came and went like mechanical heartbeats, carrying their human cargo to and from the city's core. The university waited within walking distance, its presence both salvation and curse. He could afford to exist here, in this liminal space between prosperity and decay, where the trees still grew thick enough to hide whatever truths men wished to keep hidden.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, white porches hanging off them like bones, green metal roofs catching what light there was. Each built to mirror the other yet standing alone in their own right. Folk gathered some evenings in driveways unspoken and predetermined, their voices carrying across the settling dusk while young ones drew their chalk figures on the ground or sent their kites up into the darkening sky. Like some remembrance of times past, before the world grew cold with its screens and circuits.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up against a sky that carried clouds white as burial shrouds. But the weather turned mean. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark like some mechanical banshee and we all scattered to our holes. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever precious things I thought to save while the big one paced and barked at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles spilling across the earth.\n\nWhen it was done the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cold. Ninety-two degrees to seventy-five in the time it takes to draw breath. The ice melted where it fell on the burning pavement and then the sun broke through and the rain came with it. Twin rainbows rose up out of nothing like some biblical covenant. Took pictures with the camera though they couldn't capture what was there. The truth of it.\n\nThe streets stayed quiet a while longer till folk emerged from wherever they'd sheltered, like survivors of some great catastrophe. Then life resumed its rhythm. Women and children out while supper cooked inside. Northern girl gone south, I found myself taken by their slow sweet way of talking. My rooms different from my neighbors though the shells that held them looked the same from without. Some smaller than they had any right to be.\n\nI walk the field out back sometimes down to where the pond lies still and dark. Deer move through the morning mist and bullfrogs sound their ancient songs. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters call across the dawn from farms I cannot see and sometimes in the evening the donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding some lost coin in the dirt. Something precious that had been waiting there all along.",
            "Ten years in this place. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. When we first come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept like a child cause I was one. Mama and daddy said it was for the better. Better houses better schools. Less of what folk called ghetto though words like that dont mean much when youre leaving behind what you know.\n\nTime passed like it does. Made friends. Made enemies too. Neighbors stayed strange except for Mr Glen and Dennis living right aside us. Good folk. Like blood almost. I member Mr Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him getting hitched again and all of us there dancing. Ms Veda in her white dress throwing that little leg strap that I caught though the flowers passed me by. Danced with Marsharii that night. His daughter. Aint seen her since and sometimes I wonder where the wind took her.\n\nThe streets here wind like snakes in summer. Got myself a GPS now but back then it was all guesswork. Used to roam with Kason and Curtis. Playing them games and living like time would never catch us. Sometimes I'd take to the park. Still do. Something in the quiet there speaks truth. Carry sticks from the hardware store. Practice balance. Bring my wooden sword too sometimes. Just a man and his thoughts among the trees.\n\nCourts there too. Basketball and tennis both though I aint played neither in what feels like forever. Daddy and Mr Graves taught me and my friend the ways of tennis. Worked us till we could hardly stand but there was joy in it. Joy in all of it maybe.\n\nReckon theres more stories buried in these streets than I could tell. More yet to come too. Time dont stop its turning for no man but sometimes it gives you something worth holding onto. Sometimes thats enough.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, sprawled across South Carolina dirt, nothing special save for what grew from its soil. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World the sign said, standing stark against the sky like some proclamation of glory long past. Fields stretched out beyond sight, peach trees marching in endless rows like soldiers frozen in formation, and between them cattle grazed on whatever the hard earth would yield.\n\nHouses stood back from the road like shy children, most wearing metal crowns to ward off the merciless southern sun, others topped with shingles gray as tombstones. They didnt crowd together but kept their distance, each surrounded by its own kingdom of dirt and grass where man and beast sought their living.\n\nThe town proper wasnt much. One stoplight swaying in the wind where four roads met. Three places to quiet your hunger: Hong Kong where a single family worked their days away, Fiesta where Mexico lived in exile, and Garys where burgers died daily deaths. The pizza place was gone now. Just gone.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug still stood, known more for its cherry cola than any medicine it might dispense. The IGA market charged dear for its goods and most folks drove the long miles to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, their tires eating up the asphalt like hungry ghosts. But the Dollar General, that was different. From dawn till dusk it breathed people in and out like some great retail beast.\n\nPossibilities Furniture sat there with its two movers and its kind woman owner who everyone knew, and next door Clarks dealt in the grooming of pets, washing and cutting and watching over the animals folks couldn't keep at home. The doctors both for man and beast kept to themselves on the edge of things, small operations but enough for what the town required.\n\nOne school was all they had. After that the children went elsewhere, like seeds scattered by the wind. They were building something they called a park, two and a half acres of hope that might bring new life to the town, but for now there wasnt much. No picture shows, no bowling, no place for young folk to gather or children to play or dogs to run. But it was a town all the same, so small you might pass through it between one breath and the next, like a dream you cant quite remember when you wake.",
            "He lived there with his wife and the two girls, eleven and fourteen, in that southern place where two highways met. The street between them carried more traffic than a man might want but they'd grown used to its sounds like you grow used to the sound of your own breathing. The neighborhood stood quiet mostly. Folk didn't come and go much. They knew the faces and the vehicles that belonged and those that didn't belong stood out like strange dogs.\n\nThe house sat on the corner where they could watch it all. Watch the people doing what people do. Mowing grass and raking leaves and living out their days. In winter the children would take to sledding down the hill on the side street, their voices carrying through the cold air like birds. He and his worked from home and they lived their lives in full view of everyone else who lived there, playing even in the rain sometimes, grilling meat on the back deck where the smoke would rise up through the trees that had been there longer than any of them.\n\nFrom March clear through to October you could hear somebody's mower running somewhere. The neighborhood had been woods once and still kept its trees, kept its shade, kept its yearly tithe of leaves that needed burning when fall came. He liked that smell. Lately the winters had gone soft, like fall just stretched on forever without end.\n\nThe garage stood at the back and that's where they came and went mostly, front door silent as a tomb except for the rare stranger's knock. He'd work on his truck sometimes with the garage doors standing open, feeling the pulse of the neighborhood like a man feels his own heartbeat. Holidays brought the quiet broken by visiting kin, cars parked everywhere like bright beetles. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. All them days when families remember they're families.\n\nIt wasn't a bad place to live. If it weren't for that through street it might have been perfect. But perfect ain't for this world, he reckoned. Never was.",
            "The high desert stretches out before me like some vast and ancient thing. Dirt and more dirt. Brown upon brown. Unless you lived here you wouldnt know how it gets inside you, that endless brown, and when you see green its like finding money, knowing full well somebody's bleeding themselves dry to keep it. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart like survivors of some plague but now they're closing in. The city grows like a cancer but I reckon everywhere does these days.\n\nFolk here are mostly good but like anywhere theres darkness too. My patch is full of old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind their curtains. The stores are all chains, Food for Less and such, nothing special. You want better you got to drive. Construction runs through this place like a backbone, men building more houses in the empty spaces that shrink year by year. Makes me uneasy. Left the big city once and dont aim to live in another.\n\nI work the drywall myself, putting up walls and ceilings in buildings that spring up like weeds after rain. But its the animals that make this place. Folk come here for the stark beauty but stay for what lives in it. The desert's got its own rules, its own kind of life that needs protecting. People ought to learn about whats here before they come barging in. My three young ones have taken to it like they was born to it, always out hunting lizards and desert bugs, their hands dirty with the searching.\n\nWe got our attractions too. The county fair comes round once a year, bringing noise and light to the quiet. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like some ancient thing waiting. The museum holds bones and artifacts, telling stories of what came before, when different folk walked these parts. But mostly its just the desert stretching out, patient and eternal, not caring much whether we stay or go.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland. Dormitories rise up from the earth like ancient monoliths, their windows dead and dark in the failing light. He considers this place his neighborhood though he knows it aint like other men's neighborhoods. No. This here's different.\n\nThree kinds of dwellings stand sentinel in this concrete valley. The apartments first, stacked like burial chambers two floors high, twenty souls or thereabouts contained within their walls. Then the houses proper, scattered few and far between, where the older ones dwell. Alumni they call them, though that word means little now in this godless place. Last come the dormitories themselves, great concrete beasts swallowing hundreds of young lives whole, two to a cell like prisoners waiting out their sentence.\n\nThe people here come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds thrown together in this stone garden like leaves in a dead autumn wind. Professional folk claim the houses while the young ones, green as spring corn, huddle in their dormitory caves. The older students take to the apartments like wounded animals seeking shelter, marking time until their own exodus comes.\n\nStores line the concrete arteries like the last outposts of some fallen civilization. Food halls where young bodies gather to feed. Clothing shops bearing the mark of the institution like some tribal totem. A single park remains, an oasis in this academic desert, kept clean by unspoken law and communal vigilance. Everything a body might need contained within these borders, he thinks. Everything and nothing.\n\nHe watches them move through this strange country, these pilgrims of knowledge, their backpacks like the burdens of ancient wanderers. Each one carrying their own history, their own destiny. Each one both stranger and kin in this place that aint quite a home but aint quite not neither. The sun sets behind the library's towering spire, casting long shadows across the quad like prison bars, and he knows that this here's his neighborhood now, for better or worse, until the time comes to move on.",
            "Aint no sidewalks here. Everything runs down and away like water in a drain and the house sits alone atop the highest rise where folk come to test their legs against the slope. They call it the workout hill though there aint nothing organized about it. Just people running up and down like blood through veins. No path but the road itself, pocked and scarred like an old mans face. Above the power lines hang in disarray, patched and mended from countless storms, a patchwork of copper and steel that tells its own history of wind and rain.\n\nThe trees stand like dark sentinels. Evergreens thick as night but the people here hate them. Take axe and saw to them whenever they can, wanting nothing between their eyes and the water below. Houses rise up proud and gleaming, glass faces turned toward the bay like worshipers. When the sun sets the water burns orange beneath the clouds that hover permanent as death. Most days the world is gray and wet. Moss claims everything that dont move and some things that do. Left my truck sitting one month and found it turned to green velvet, took half a day to scrape the life from its metal skin.\n\nChildren are scarce as sunshine though theres a school nearby. Old folk mostly, retired and waiting. Dogs run the streets like they own them. Bold as thieves theyll come right in your house if you leave a door standing open. Found one in my parlor once, staring at me like I was the intruder. Rabbits too, big as cats sometimes, digging up the earth like tiny gravediggers. My cats hunt them though, keeping nature in its proper balance. Birds wheel overhead, little ones and sometimes the great raptors until the crows drive them off like black-winged sheriffs.\n\nNo stores to speak of but down by the water where the land gives way to stone you can find places that serve up what the bay provides. The shore aint much for swimming but the rocks make good missiles to throw at the gray water. The far shore sits quiet through the mist, close enough to see but far enough to keep its secrets. Just water and stone and sky, same as its always been.",
            "The streets of Bensonhurst lay before him like some great concrete labyrinth, the subway trains rumbling deep beneath the earth like ancient beasts. He walked these streets as countless others had before him, the new world rising up from the bones of the old. Asian storefront signs hung stark against the gray buildings, their neon characters bleeding into the morning mist.\n\nEvery block held another market or laundromat, testament to the changing tides of humanity that washed through these streets year after year. The markets stood shoulder to shoulder, four within two minutes walking, their shelves stocked with strange fruits and dried things in jars that caught the light like creatures preserved in formaldehyde. The prices were good. The food fresh. The people came.\n\nHe thought about how the neighborhood had changed. Waves of immigrants washing up on these shores like tidewrack, each generation laying claim to their small piece of the world. Their children speaking a new tongue, American born but carrying the old world in their blood.\n\nThe park stood renovated, pristine. Basketball courts stretched out like graves, ten in all. Soccer fields and baseball diamonds where children played in the dying light. Water fountains spraying their benediction in summer heat. All of them there together, different colors, different tongues, but children just the same.\n\nAt night the streets changed. Music thundered from passing cars like war drums, engines screaming into the darkness. The thieves came too, taking what wasnt theirs, leaving their mark like animals marking territory. Violence lurked in doorways and alleyways, senseless and brutal as nature itself.\n\nHe'd seen it himself years ago, felt fists against flesh, tasted blood. The neighborhood was safer now but still held danger in its shadows. Even the simple act of receiving packages had become a kind of warfare, boxes disappearing from doorsteps like prey snatched by unseen predators.\n\nAnd everywhere the dog shit lay like landmines on the sidewalk, despite signs and fines and civilized intentions. Each morning brought new deposits, fresh evidence of mans disregard for his fellow man. He watched his step carefully, threading his way through the minefield of human indifference, carrying the weight of all he'd seen in this place that was both heaven and hell, sanctuary and prison, home and exile all at once.",
            "You have to know what weird means here in Portland Oregon and know it well. Like some dark prophecy written on brick and mortar behind a place that serves pizza and drink and flesh and song, all of it skirting the edges of what men call legal. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk say it's a remembrance of older days when the city was cheaper and unknown and bred strange cultures in its belly like some great beast. Others hear it like a calling, come here where your strangeness aint strange no more but something folk smile upon.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their steel and glass towers rising up like teeth from the earth but the weird remains. Not that weird means welcome to all things but it welcomes what other places cast out. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere else in this tired world. Weird aint the opposite of normal cause we got that too. Got our yoga folk and our coffee drinkers in pressed shirts but maybe we just dont hold so tight to the pretending that comes with it all.\n\nWhere I lay my head the houses stand painted like fever dreams. Gardens grow wild along the streets, herbs and flowers tangled together like lovers. Come summer the free boxes appear. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic. Like gifts from some nameless god, they hold treasures meant for whoever passes by. Clothes mostly. Books. But sometimes other things. Things you never knew you needed till you saw them there in the box.\n\nThe magic of these streets is what Portland means to me though Im just one kind of strange in an ocean of strange. Some wouldnt touch those sidewalk offerings. They do their bending with goats or scream at men kicking balls in green jerseys. All kinds here. Dreamers and failed dreamers drinking away the memory of dreams in dark bars.\n\nThe drugs are here too. Always are where minds break under gray skies and endless rain. Got our homeless too, drawn by what little help we give though its never enough. Never is anywhere. The rest of us shift between pity and rage like weather. In that we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. North they stretch like ancient gods bearing witness to each dawn and dusk that passes over this land. A man might forget them in the mundane sufferings of his days but they remain. Unmoving. Unchanging. When the darkness of mind comes heavy upon you they call out with their silence and their strength flows into your bones like water into parched earth. One day following another until the days lose count.\n\nI came here young. A boy really. The university stretched out below them mountains that stood watch over all like sentinels of stone. The campus had its own beauty right enough. Old buildings and trees and pools of water that caught the sky in their depths but it was them mountains that owned my soul complete.\n\nThe town lay scattered below like bones bleached in the sun. Little cafes where students sat hunched over books and computers drinking bitter coffee till their hands shook. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks faded to colors you couldn't name. For them few blocks it was like some bigger place. Some city where people moved quick and talked loud but it didn't last. Past the library the quiet came back like it had never left.\n\nStrange how a place can hold both peace and pain in equal measure. I seen both there. Walked with friends past playground swings gone to rust. Ran through them downtown streets to catch some picture show in a theater too fine for the likes of us. But I seen darker things too. Sat by them ponds at night watching creatures go about their business while my mind wandered down paths best left untrod. Wondering what purpose God or the devil had in mind when he put me here.\n\nSometimes I'd walk. Past the pond and the park and them little houses all lined up neat like children waiting to be counted. Till I hit the main road where palm trees caught the morning sun like fire. And looking north there they'd be. Them mountains touching the sky like they always had and always would. Speaking without words about carrying on. About persevering. About enduring like stone.",
            "You wouldnt see it at first. Not with them strip malls and empty stores standing like sentinels against the gray sky. Behind the old Whole Foods that aint whole no more and past them hotels where folk only come in summer when the air hangs thick like molasses, theres life. Real life.\n\nStreets wind back there like veins in a corpse. Apartment buildings stood shoulder to shoulder like old soldiers, each one darker than the last. First ones got trouble in em. Bad trouble that makes the news but we dont speak on that. Evil finds its way everywhere. But them other buildings, three of em standing there like brothers, they was different. Across the road the community college squatted low, quiet-like, where sleepy students drift in carrying their coffee cups like holy things. Iron gates screech their morning song while cars stack up behind em, drivers cursing the day.\n\nRoad ends at a T, park on one side where broken folk go to mend their bones. They got chairs out front where the ceiling fan turns slow, pushing the thick air round and round like God stirring soup. Children run wild in the grass across the way, their bodies writing stories in the air while bees dance drunk in the flowers. Old folk walking dogs eye the skateboard kids like they was carrying plague. Young girls gather like crows by the playground equipment, talking bout things that dont matter none.\n\nStrip mall stands guard over it all. Sushi place never has no customers but stays open like its waiting for something. Swimming store. Nail shop. All of em lined up neat like teeth in a skull. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish. Them teenagers from the park get their frozen sugar and their nicotine clouds, thinking they invented being young.\n\nThis here's a piece of something old. Something that dont change much. Time moves different here, like molasses in winter, thick and slow and dark. The south holding onto its ghosts, keeping em close like precious things.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in the quiet streets. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins sharing organs neither could live without. Small yards stretched before them and narrow driveways ran alongside like dried-up creek beds. They were monuments to some American notion that had taken root in the hearts of men and flowered brief and violent before withering away leaving only these husks behind. Yet they endured. Silent testimony to what once was and what might yet be again.\n\nThe people moved about their days like sleepwalkers. Yards unkempt now where once they'd been manicured like cemetery plots. But automobiles still occupied the drives two by two like animals come to some concrete ark and children played in the streets as if the world ended at the town limits. The old school building rose up from the earth like some ancient pueblo dwelling. Ninety years of hopes and dreams etched into its weathered walls. Churches stood empty save for dust and memories but the basketball courts thrummed with life like the beating heart of some great beast.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years. The market run by the Yemen family stood like an outpost in a foreign land, Arabs among blacks, all of them carrying stories of better days when neighbor knew neighbor and children played without fear. Where the karate school once stood now stood a pharmacy dispensing chemical dreams to replace the celluloid ones that had died with the last kung fu movie. The theatre remained, showing fragments of the past to gray heads who remembered when pictures moved slower and cost less.\n\nThe expressway passed through like a river of steel and concrete but gave no sustenance to the town. The old ones had seen to that, turning away the exit ramps like biblical plagues that would destroy their eden. Now they built a new school while arguing over totems and symbols as if choosing right might keep the future at bay. But the future came anyway, seeping in through the cracks like the ash-gray dawn of another day.",
            "The city stretches out endless and gray. Buildings rise like ancient monoliths from the cracked earth, some tall as mountains, others squatting low against the ground like creatures waiting to die. Between them the streets run like dried riverbeds, choked with machines that crawl forward and stop and crawl forward again in their mindless procession.\n\nHe walked the streets where the storefronts pressed against one another, names in different tongues marking their territories. Korean letters. Chinese symbols. Armenian script that looked like the marks of birds in wet sand. The people moved past him like ghosts, their eyes never meeting his, each sealed away in their own private darkness.\n\nThe parks stood as islands in the concrete waste. Children played there still, their voices carrying across the dead grass while their minders watched from wooden benches worn smooth by countless others before them. Jews in their black coats. The queer folk with their bright colors. The Russians speaking their harsh tongue. All of them together yet apart, like creatures sharing the same cage but separated by invisible walls.\n\nAt night the roads filled with red lights stretching to the horizon. Two hours to travel ten miles. The machines idling in their endless migration. No one walked anymore. They'd forgotten how, like fish forgetting to swim. New towers rose everywhere, steel bones reaching toward a sky they'd never touch. The people who lived in the old places watched them rise and shook their heads and muttered about the newcomers who'd come to fill them.\n\nHe remembered when things were different. Playing in the street with the boy next door, their mothers watching from windows now dark and empty. But that was long ago. Now the neighbors were strangers, their faces blank as courthouse walls, their names unknown and unknowable. The community had died but no one had bothered to bury it. It just went on existing, like everything else in this place, neither alive nor dead but somewhere in between.",
            "She looked out at the endless rows of corn stretching toward the dimming horizon and asked where everything was. This is it, I told her. She'd never known such emptiness, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The fields stretched out before us like some biblical wasteland, stalks bent and swaying in the wind that swept eternal across the Ohio plains.\n\nWe drove on down a road no wider than two cars might pass. Beyond the quarry water black as oil lay the development where I lived. Houses of brick and stucco rose up from half-acre plots tended with a devotion bordering on violence. Spring brought forth flowers planted with mechanical precision alongside trees that died and were reborn with each turning of the seasons. Mercedes automobiles gleamed in driveways like chrome coffins catching the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. Ancient now but still he rode his mower like some pagan god of suburban order, singing songs in a tongue none understood. Doctor once, they said. Now just another ghost drifting across the manufactured grass, John Deere his mechanical familiar.\n\nOur house stood grey and stark against the sky. Geese moved through the side yard like pale wraiths while the terrier gave chase, all fury and purpose. A stream whispered past carrying secrets to the quarry. Bullfrogs sang their throaty hymns while cattle lowed in distant fields like mourners at a wake. Past the bridge we'd built lay wilderness untamed. Trees and herbs and flowers that grew by no man's leave. This was my kingdom in younger days. Built forts in those trees like shelter against the coming dark. Hunted phantoms through the woods with neighborhood children who've long since vanished into memory.\n\nWinter came cruel as judgment. The yard transformed from verdant life to barren waste. Trees that once blazed with color stood skeletal and bare against the leaden sky. Snow fell like ash from heaven, turning all to white desolation. My sister's angels pressed into the drifts like fossil records of innocence. We warred with snowballs hurled from fortresses of ice and stick, playing at destruction in our private universe where nothing existed beyond the moment. Just children then, before the world revealed its teeth."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Small town Michigan where the farmland bleeds into tourist towns like blood seeping through gauze. Aint no malls here. No Walmart. No chain restaurants with their neon signs burning holes in the night. Everything's a drive. But Lord if it aint beautiful, this water-blessed land. My piece of earth sits between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix like a child between two vast mothers. Water everywhere you turn. Always some shore waiting to swallow your feet.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks of small places, of lives lived close to the ground. Houses stand apart from each other like stubborn old men, each one different, each one carrying its years in its own way. Some got new faces, others wear their age plain. Most got basements you can see from the road, like bones showing through worn skin. Aluminum siding gone gray and weary on many. Colors everywhere though, like God himself couldn't make up his mind.\n\nYards stretch out wild and lived-in. Trampolines standing like black metal insects. Garden plots where folks work the earth with their hands. Fences holding dogs and memories. These houses, they hold Middle America. Working folk who wake up tired and go to bed tired and somewhere in between raise up their young.\n\nChildren run these streets like water. Dogs and bikes and roller skates. Neighbors know each other's shadows. They can smell a stranger. Folk grilling in their yards raise a hand to passersby, dog walkers nod like old friends. The grass stays cut, the bushes trimmed, leaves dont linger come autumn. Aint beautiful like them magazine neighborhoods, but its good. Safe. The kind of place where you can lay your head down at night and know your children sleep easy.\n\nSheriff's office sits close enough to walk to. Health department too. Recycling center down the way where trucks come and go like mechanical pilgrims. Baseball fields echo with voices calling names into the evening air. Small planes growl overhead from the town airport, their engines speaking in tongues only pilots know. Ice cream place is walking distance. Downtown too if your legs are willing. Children can ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through these quiet streets where everyone knows everyone and the water's always waiting at the edge of town.\n\nThis is my place. This is where we are.",
            "The houses stood like grave markers in that suburban waste. Row after row of them identical and mute beneath the scorching sun. No character to speak of save what the homeowners association deemed fit in their godless pursuit of uniformity. Each yard a mirror of the last. Small patches of grass maintained with religious fervor and decorative stone scattered like the bones of some ancient thing and driveways too short for any proper use. Trees stood dwarfed and regulated, testimony to man's desire to control even nature herself.\n\nThe concrete roads stretched pristine and perfect through the development, unmarred by time or wear as if laid down yesterday though they weren't. No mailboxes stood sentry before the homes like in times past. Instead they'd built communal boxes at the street's end, all locked away behind cold metal doors with two larger chambers for packages, as if the very act of mail delivery needed to be sanitized and controlled.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the city's edge where suburbia met the wild lands in an uneasy truce. They'd built pools there, gated and watched, and walking trails that wound through what remained of the natural world. Retired folk mostly inhabited these parts now, with some younger professionals mixed in like pepper in salt. They watched each other with practiced vigilance, each serving as the other's keeper in this manufactured paradise.\n\nThe city itself sprawled vast but retained something of its small-town heart, like a child trying on its father's clothes. One mall stood testament to progress, neither grand nor humble but sufficient to its purpose. Fifteen minutes drive in any direction would take you to the temples of commerce - stores high and low, from the organic sanctuaries of the wealthy to the bare-bones outlets where the poor sought sustenance.\n\nThe whole of it lay there beneath the empty sky, safe and maintained and typical as a dream. A place where even chaos had been ordered into submission, where wildness had been tamed and packaged for consumption. Where you could drive your car to any chain store your heart desired, so long as you were willing to trade fifteen minutes of your life to get there.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the missing. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more each month to inhabit and none had spoken of such tales before. Not my companions nor any other soul. Perhaps it's the weight of living that silences them. Some nights you can hear them weeping through the walls, my friends, crushed under the burden of survival. Time teaches you to live lean. You learn to love the scent of secondhand things, those castoff toys and clothes wrapped in time's shroud. The nose grows dull with age. Some take to tobacco. Others just forget what clean truly meant.\n\nBut the markets of the poor persist. They smell of adulthood itself, like magazines gone yellow atop a piano that ain't been opened in years. The smell works its way into leather and stays, defying soap and water both. Three such stores stand within walking distance. Starting from the far end you can make your pilgrimage through two charity shops, past the library, through a place that trades in rare books, ending at the curiosity shop. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but them shops stay quiet as tombs. Silent sanctuaries where afternoon light dies slow.\n\nYear by year the city grows fat with cars and bodies. They call it development. Some great digital empire made its throne here, and the city groans with growing pains like New York before it. Everyone carries their own purpose here, asks nothing of nobody. A man can wrap himself in solitude and none will try to pierce that shell. Not like down South where concern passes for caring. Here the city breaks against you like waves on stone and recedes just the same.\n\nLife moves through the walls. A pianist dwells next door, two would-be singers above. Less strangers sharing walls than a fellowship of sorts. We come together in need, mark births and deaths alike, extend help when we can. Fortune smiled on me in this. My neighbors treat me kindly and I do the same. I mind my mess and share my food and they return the gesture. We pass letters between us like sacred things. I've made my home in this concrete labyrinth but it's them that makes it bearable. Makes me think I ain't ruined everything after all.",
            "The town lies just beyond the reach of the city, a small midwestern place where the wind carries stories of better days. On the east side where we dwell the houses stand weathered and wanting, their paint peeling like old scabs, rented or bought by those who carry little in their pockets save hope and copper pennies. But there aint no ugliness here. The people nod and speak when you pass. They remember what courtesy means in a world that's forgotten.\n\nThe violence comes sometimes like a thief in the night. Gunshots echo in the darkness. People disappear. The neighbors lost their boy outside a bar last year, his blood soaking into cracked pavement while music played inside. We've been spared such grief save for the occasional taking of things left too long on the porch, like offerings to hungry ghosts.\n\nThe poison that men call fentanyl has worked its way through the veins of this town like a slow cancer. Bodies stack up in the morgue while the living learn to push needles of salvation into dying flesh. Narcan they call it. A resurrection in a bottle.\n\nThe boy goes to school where good people still work at being good. Special needs, they say, but he aint never been treated as less than whole. The teachers remember what kindness means. They feed all the children here, knowing hunger dont care about pride. Twenty percent below the poverty line, the numbers say, but numbers dont tell about the heart of things.\n\nThe city men work their improvements in the center of town and the west side where the money flows. Fresh pavement, new trees, parks where children play. But the east side waits like a forgotten child, watching its brothers get new shoes while its own feet stay bare.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint worth much in dollars but it keeps out the rain and holds our memories. The people here they get by. They remember what community means. Sometimes at night I stand on the porch and listen to the town breathing, all its broken dreams and stubborn hopes rising up like smoke from chimneys in winter. This is home. There aint no other place we'd rather be.",
            "The neighborhood set upon the hill like some ancient fortress, buildings standing sentinel with their histories etched deep in mortar and stone. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater stands dark and brooding, its marquee dead these many years. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather when the warmth comes, an arcade where beer flows and laughter echoes against brick walls. Lines of them standing patient in the summer dark, waiting their turn at whatever salvation lies within.\n\nThe park spreads vast above it all, ringed in concrete like the walls of some forgotten coliseum. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents lined neat as gravestones along the steps where the rain beats its endless dirge. They huddle close, these wanderers, seeking warmth in numbers, closer to where mercy flows from shower heads and soap dispensers in the family center down below.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks to me, nor them proud buildings reaching toward whatever god might still be watching. It's the people carrying their histories like scars. Hilltop, they called it, when blood ran in gutters and federal men swept through like locusts, badges glinting, taking what they would. Stories pass like scripture now, whispered in doorways, told to newcomers like me who came seeking something real.\n\nWhite folk dont walk these streets after dark, they say, though that warning rings hollow as an old church bell, echoing from days when fear ruled these blocks. Maybe its that my skin carries enough shadow to pass, or maybe the Hill sees in me what it sees in itself - the weight of old wounds, the knowing that fear and ignorance still poison the well we all drink from.\n\nThese streets know me now. They've sheltered me when rain fell like judgment. Seen me huddled against concrete while strangers passed carrying kindness like lanterns in the dark. Five dollars pressed into a cold palm, words of worth spoken soft as prayer. The Hill claims its own, and I am claimed, marked by this place where laundromat lights burn late for them that need charging, where jackets appear like miracles on cold shoulders.\n\nThis is home. These streets. These people. This history written in brick and blood and mercy. The Hill abides, and I abide with it.",
            "When I came to this place I was just a boy, not yet fourteen, the houses standing like sentinels in the dull August heat. Making friends dont come easy to a boy that age but there was two others lived close by, one two doors down and another somewhere along that same street. They're gone now but the memories aint. Most that was here then is here still. Houses like you'd see anywhere in this country, two stories high with vinyl siding gone gray in the weather, pressed together like old friends sharing secrets. Summer weekends you can hear the children, their voices carrying across yards gone brown in the heat, their laughter echoing off aluminum gutters and chain link fences.\n\nQuiet mostly. The kind of quiet that speaks to something deeper than just the absence of sound. Folk here mind their own unless there's need otherwise. Packages come and stay where they're left. Trust aint something you find easy these days but here it remains like some relic of an older time.\n\nThe park sits just beyond where the houses end. Basketball courts where the asphalt's cracked and weeds push through. Football fields where blood was spilled, my own once when some boy's elbow found my nose. But that aint what I remember most. What I remember is the good times, times that seem now like they belonged to someone else. These days I take my cousin's young ones there. Watch them on the swings, their legs pumping at the sky like they might touch it if they just try hard enough.\n\nThe streets here are a patchwork of cultures pressed together like pages in an old book. Chinese food and Mexican. Indian spices carrying on the wind. Italian too. Most folk now they just press buttons on their phones and food appears like magic at their doors. Fast food mostly, pizza too. All the stores a body could need. Cleaners where shirts hang like pale ghosts in windows. Drug stores facing each other across the street like gunslingers. Grocery stores with their fluorescent glow spilling onto empty parking lots at night. Even got an Indian store where spices sit in glass jars like jewels.\n\nWhen I hear tell of other places, neighborhoods where folk cant trust their own shadow, I know what we got here is something rare. Something worth holding onto. Like finding water in a desert, or truth in a world gone mad with lies.",
            "The college loomed beyond the treeline, a concrete sentinel watching over streets that held no memory of better days. The apartment buildings stood like weathered tombstones, their facades grayed and peeling in the filtered sunlight. Forty-second street lay before him like a promise, newly paved, the sidewalks clean and wide, but behind it forty-third crouched in shadow, its concrete broken and heaved up like the bones of something long dead.\n\nHe walked past the bars where students gathered, their laughter carrying across empty lots where weeds pushed through cracked asphalt. The new place charged more now, but they all did. Money was just paper anyway, worthless as the leaves that skittered across the fresh-laid sod between road and walk.\n\nThe air was thick with smoke. Not tobacco but that sweet cloying scent that seeped from beneath his neighbors' door. Management had mounted their plastic defense against it, a small box that wheezed out artificial spring. A joke if there ever was one.\n\nBehind the buildings the trees stood sentinel, their branches reaching like gnarled fingers over rooftops. Some had been cut, their stumps testament to man's constant war with nature. Beyond them lay forty-third street where the shadows grew longer and darker, where sirens wailed more often in the night. The buildings there wore their decay like a shroud, their windows staring blind and empty at passersby.\n\nThe new apartments down the way were false prophets, pretty shells built quick and cheap, drawing in the faithful with promises their thin walls couldn't keep. The restaurant across served microwaved dreams on paper plates, and the gas station's fluorescent lights cast their sickly glow over minimum wage desperation.\n\nBut it was home. The buses came and went like mechanical heartbeats, carrying their human cargo to and from the city's core. The university waited within walking distance, its presence both salvation and curse. He could afford to exist here, in this liminal space between prosperity and decay, where the trees still grew thick enough to hide whatever truths men wished to keep hidden.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, white porches hanging off them like bones, green metal roofs catching what light there was. Each built to mirror the other yet standing alone in their own right. Folk gathered some evenings in driveways unspoken and predetermined, their voices carrying across the settling dusk while young ones drew their chalk figures on the ground or sent their kites up into the darkening sky. Like some remembrance of times past, before the world grew cold with its screens and circuits.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up against a sky that carried clouds white as burial shrouds. But the weather turned mean. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark like some mechanical banshee and we all scattered to our holes. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever precious things I thought to save while the big one paced and barked at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles spilling across the earth.\n\nWhen it was done the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cold. Ninety-two degrees to seventy-five in the time it takes to draw breath. The ice melted where it fell on the burning pavement and then the sun broke through and the rain came with it. Twin rainbows rose up out of nothing like some biblical covenant. Took pictures with the camera though they couldn't capture what was there. The truth of it.\n\nThe streets stayed quiet a while longer till folk emerged from wherever they'd sheltered, like survivors of some great catastrophe. Then life resumed its rhythm. Women and children out while supper cooked inside. Northern girl gone south, I found myself taken by their slow sweet way of talking. My rooms different from my neighbors though the shells that held them looked the same from without. Some smaller than they had any right to be.\n\nI walk the field out back sometimes down to where the pond lies still and dark. Deer move through the morning mist and bullfrogs sound their ancient songs. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters call across the dawn from farms I cannot see and sometimes in the evening the donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding some lost coin in the dirt. Something precious that had been waiting there all along.",
            "Ten years in this place. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. When we first come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept like a child cause I was one. Mama and daddy said it was for the better. Better houses better schools. Less of what folk called ghetto though words like that dont mean much when youre leaving behind what you know.\n\nTime passed like it does. Made friends. Made enemies too. Neighbors stayed strange except for Mr Glen and Dennis living right aside us. Good folk. Like blood almost. I member Mr Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him getting hitched again and all of us there dancing. Ms Veda in her white dress throwing that little leg strap that I caught though the flowers passed me by. Danced with Marsharii that night. His daughter. Aint seen her since and sometimes I wonder where the wind took her.\n\nThe streets here wind like snakes in summer. Got myself a GPS now but back then it was all guesswork. Used to roam with Kason and Curtis. Playing them games and living like time would never catch us. Sometimes I'd take to the park. Still do. Something in the quiet there speaks truth. Carry sticks from the hardware store. Practice balance. Bring my wooden sword too sometimes. Just a man and his thoughts among the trees.\n\nCourts there too. Basketball and tennis both though I aint played neither in what feels like forever. Daddy and Mr Graves taught me and my friend the ways of tennis. Worked us till we could hardly stand but there was joy in it. Joy in all of it maybe.\n\nReckon theres more stories buried in these streets than I could tell. More yet to come too. Time dont stop its turning for no man but sometimes it gives you something worth holding onto. Sometimes thats enough.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, sprawled across South Carolina dirt, nothing special save for what grew from its soil. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World the sign said, standing stark against the sky like some proclamation of glory long past. Fields stretched out beyond sight, peach trees marching in endless rows like soldiers frozen in formation, and between them cattle grazed on whatever the hard earth would yield.\n\nHouses stood back from the road like shy children, most wearing metal crowns to ward off the merciless southern sun, others topped with shingles gray as tombstones. They didnt crowd together but kept their distance, each surrounded by its own kingdom of dirt and grass where man and beast sought their living.\n\nThe town proper wasnt much. One stoplight swaying in the wind where four roads met. Three places to quiet your hunger: Hong Kong where a single family worked their days away, Fiesta where Mexico lived in exile, and Garys where burgers died daily deaths. The pizza place was gone now. Just gone.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug still stood, known more for its cherry cola than any medicine it might dispense. The IGA market charged dear for its goods and most folks drove the long miles to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, their tires eating up the asphalt like hungry ghosts. But the Dollar General, that was different. From dawn till dusk it breathed people in and out like some great retail beast.\n\nPossibilities Furniture sat there with its two movers and its kind woman owner who everyone knew, and next door Clarks dealt in the grooming of pets, washing and cutting and watching over the animals folks couldn't keep at home. The doctors both for man and beast kept to themselves on the edge of things, small operations but enough for what the town required.\n\nOne school was all they had. After that the children went elsewhere, like seeds scattered by the wind. They were building something they called a park, two and a half acres of hope that might bring new life to the town, but for now there wasnt much. No picture shows, no bowling, no place for young folk to gather or children to play or dogs to run. But it was a town all the same, so small you might pass through it between one breath and the next, like a dream you cant quite remember when you wake.",
            "He lived there with his wife and the two girls, eleven and fourteen, in that southern place where two highways met. The street between them carried more traffic than a man might want but they'd grown used to its sounds like you grow used to the sound of your own breathing. The neighborhood stood quiet mostly. Folk didn't come and go much. They knew the faces and the vehicles that belonged and those that didn't belong stood out like strange dogs.\n\nThe house sat on the corner where they could watch it all. Watch the people doing what people do. Mowing grass and raking leaves and living out their days. In winter the children would take to sledding down the hill on the side street, their voices carrying through the cold air like birds. He and his worked from home and they lived their lives in full view of everyone else who lived there, playing even in the rain sometimes, grilling meat on the back deck where the smoke would rise up through the trees that had been there longer than any of them.\n\nFrom March clear through to October you could hear somebody's mower running somewhere. The neighborhood had been woods once and still kept its trees, kept its shade, kept its yearly tithe of leaves that needed burning when fall came. He liked that smell. Lately the winters had gone soft, like fall just stretched on forever without end.\n\nThe garage stood at the back and that's where they came and went mostly, front door silent as a tomb except for the rare stranger's knock. He'd work on his truck sometimes with the garage doors standing open, feeling the pulse of the neighborhood like a man feels his own heartbeat. Holidays brought the quiet broken by visiting kin, cars parked everywhere like bright beetles. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. All them days when families remember they're families.\n\nIt wasn't a bad place to live. If it weren't for that through street it might have been perfect. But perfect ain't for this world, he reckoned. Never was.",
            "The high desert stretches out before me like some vast and ancient thing. Dirt and more dirt. Brown upon brown. Unless you lived here you wouldnt know how it gets inside you, that endless brown, and when you see green its like finding money, knowing full well somebody's bleeding themselves dry to keep it. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart like survivors of some plague but now they're closing in. The city grows like a cancer but I reckon everywhere does these days.\n\nFolk here are mostly good but like anywhere theres darkness too. My patch is full of old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind their curtains. The stores are all chains, Food for Less and such, nothing special. You want better you got to drive. Construction runs through this place like a backbone, men building more houses in the empty spaces that shrink year by year. Makes me uneasy. Left the big city once and dont aim to live in another.\n\nI work the drywall myself, putting up walls and ceilings in buildings that spring up like weeds after rain. But its the animals that make this place. Folk come here for the stark beauty but stay for what lives in it. The desert's got its own rules, its own kind of life that needs protecting. People ought to learn about whats here before they come barging in. My three young ones have taken to it like they was born to it, always out hunting lizards and desert bugs, their hands dirty with the searching.\n\nWe got our attractions too. The county fair comes round once a year, bringing noise and light to the quiet. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like some ancient thing waiting. The museum holds bones and artifacts, telling stories of what came before, when different folk walked these parts. But mostly its just the desert stretching out, patient and eternal, not caring much whether we stay or go.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland. Dormitories rise up from the earth like ancient monoliths, their windows dead and dark in the failing light. He considers this place his neighborhood though he knows it aint like other men's neighborhoods. No. This here's different.\n\nThree kinds of dwellings stand sentinel in this concrete valley. The apartments first, stacked like burial chambers two floors high, twenty souls or thereabouts contained within their walls. Then the houses proper, scattered few and far between, where the older ones dwell. Alumni they call them, though that word means little now in this godless place. Last come the dormitories themselves, great concrete beasts swallowing hundreds of young lives whole, two to a cell like prisoners waiting out their sentence.\n\nThe people here come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds thrown together in this stone garden like leaves in a dead autumn wind. Professional folk claim the houses while the young ones, green as spring corn, huddle in their dormitory caves. The older students take to the apartments like wounded animals seeking shelter, marking time until their own exodus comes.\n\nStores line the concrete arteries like the last outposts of some fallen civilization. Food halls where young bodies gather to feed. Clothing shops bearing the mark of the institution like some tribal totem. A single park remains, an oasis in this academic desert, kept clean by unspoken law and communal vigilance. Everything a body might need contained within these borders, he thinks. Everything and nothing.\n\nHe watches them move through this strange country, these pilgrims of knowledge, their backpacks like the burdens of ancient wanderers. Each one carrying their own history, their own destiny. Each one both stranger and kin in this place that aint quite a home but aint quite not neither. The sun sets behind the library's towering spire, casting long shadows across the quad like prison bars, and he knows that this here's his neighborhood now, for better or worse, until the time comes to move on.",
            "Aint no sidewalks here. Everything runs down and away like water in a drain and the house sits alone atop the highest rise where folk come to test their legs against the slope. They call it the workout hill though there aint nothing organized about it. Just people running up and down like blood through veins. No path but the road itself, pocked and scarred like an old mans face. Above the power lines hang in disarray, patched and mended from countless storms, a patchwork of copper and steel that tells its own history of wind and rain.\n\nThe trees stand like dark sentinels. Evergreens thick as night but the people here hate them. Take axe and saw to them whenever they can, wanting nothing between their eyes and the water below. Houses rise up proud and gleaming, glass faces turned toward the bay like worshipers. When the sun sets the water burns orange beneath the clouds that hover permanent as death. Most days the world is gray and wet. Moss claims everything that dont move and some things that do. Left my truck sitting one month and found it turned to green velvet, took half a day to scrape the life from its metal skin.\n\nChildren are scarce as sunshine though theres a school nearby. Old folk mostly, retired and waiting. Dogs run the streets like they own them. Bold as thieves theyll come right in your house if you leave a door standing open. Found one in my parlor once, staring at me like I was the intruder. Rabbits too, big as cats sometimes, digging up the earth like tiny gravediggers. My cats hunt them though, keeping nature in its proper balance. Birds wheel overhead, little ones and sometimes the great raptors until the crows drive them off like black-winged sheriffs.\n\nNo stores to speak of but down by the water where the land gives way to stone you can find places that serve up what the bay provides. The shore aint much for swimming but the rocks make good missiles to throw at the gray water. The far shore sits quiet through the mist, close enough to see but far enough to keep its secrets. Just water and stone and sky, same as its always been.",
            "The streets of Bensonhurst lay before him like some great concrete labyrinth, the subway trains rumbling deep beneath the earth like ancient beasts. He walked these streets as countless others had before him, the new world rising up from the bones of the old. Asian storefront signs hung stark against the gray buildings, their neon characters bleeding into the morning mist.\n\nEvery block held another market or laundromat, testament to the changing tides of humanity that washed through these streets year after year. The markets stood shoulder to shoulder, four within two minutes walking, their shelves stocked with strange fruits and dried things in jars that caught the light like creatures preserved in formaldehyde. The prices were good. The food fresh. The people came.\n\nHe thought about how the neighborhood had changed. Waves of immigrants washing up on these shores like tidewrack, each generation laying claim to their small piece of the world. Their children speaking a new tongue, American born but carrying the old world in their blood.\n\nThe park stood renovated, pristine. Basketball courts stretched out like graves, ten in all. Soccer fields and baseball diamonds where children played in the dying light. Water fountains spraying their benediction in summer heat. All of them there together, different colors, different tongues, but children just the same.\n\nAt night the streets changed. Music thundered from passing cars like war drums, engines screaming into the darkness. The thieves came too, taking what wasnt theirs, leaving their mark like animals marking territory. Violence lurked in doorways and alleyways, senseless and brutal as nature itself.\n\nHe'd seen it himself years ago, felt fists against flesh, tasted blood. The neighborhood was safer now but still held danger in its shadows. Even the simple act of receiving packages had become a kind of warfare, boxes disappearing from doorsteps like prey snatched by unseen predators.\n\nAnd everywhere the dog shit lay like landmines on the sidewalk, despite signs and fines and civilized intentions. Each morning brought new deposits, fresh evidence of mans disregard for his fellow man. He watched his step carefully, threading his way through the minefield of human indifference, carrying the weight of all he'd seen in this place that was both heaven and hell, sanctuary and prison, home and exile all at once.",
            "You have to know what weird means here in Portland Oregon and know it well. Like some dark prophecy written on brick and mortar behind a place that serves pizza and drink and flesh and song, all of it skirting the edges of what men call legal. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk say it's a remembrance of older days when the city was cheaper and unknown and bred strange cultures in its belly like some great beast. Others hear it like a calling, come here where your strangeness aint strange no more but something folk smile upon.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their steel and glass towers rising up like teeth from the earth but the weird remains. Not that weird means welcome to all things but it welcomes what other places cast out. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere else in this tired world. Weird aint the opposite of normal cause we got that too. Got our yoga folk and our coffee drinkers in pressed shirts but maybe we just dont hold so tight to the pretending that comes with it all.\n\nWhere I lay my head the houses stand painted like fever dreams. Gardens grow wild along the streets, herbs and flowers tangled together like lovers. Come summer the free boxes appear. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic. Like gifts from some nameless god, they hold treasures meant for whoever passes by. Clothes mostly. Books. But sometimes other things. Things you never knew you needed till you saw them there in the box.\n\nThe magic of these streets is what Portland means to me though Im just one kind of strange in an ocean of strange. Some wouldnt touch those sidewalk offerings. They do their bending with goats or scream at men kicking balls in green jerseys. All kinds here. Dreamers and failed dreamers drinking away the memory of dreams in dark bars.\n\nThe drugs are here too. Always are where minds break under gray skies and endless rain. Got our homeless too, drawn by what little help we give though its never enough. Never is anywhere. The rest of us shift between pity and rage like weather. In that we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. North they stretch like ancient gods bearing witness to each dawn and dusk that passes over this land. A man might forget them in the mundane sufferings of his days but they remain. Unmoving. Unchanging. When the darkness of mind comes heavy upon you they call out with their silence and their strength flows into your bones like water into parched earth. One day following another until the days lose count.\n\nI came here young. A boy really. The university stretched out below them mountains that stood watch over all like sentinels of stone. The campus had its own beauty right enough. Old buildings and trees and pools of water that caught the sky in their depths but it was them mountains that owned my soul complete.\n\nThe town lay scattered below like bones bleached in the sun. Little cafes where students sat hunched over books and computers drinking bitter coffee till their hands shook. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks faded to colors you couldn't name. For them few blocks it was like some bigger place. Some city where people moved quick and talked loud but it didn't last. Past the library the quiet came back like it had never left.\n\nStrange how a place can hold both peace and pain in equal measure. I seen both there. Walked with friends past playground swings gone to rust. Ran through them downtown streets to catch some picture show in a theater too fine for the likes of us. But I seen darker things too. Sat by them ponds at night watching creatures go about their business while my mind wandered down paths best left untrod. Wondering what purpose God or the devil had in mind when he put me here.\n\nSometimes I'd walk. Past the pond and the park and them little houses all lined up neat like children waiting to be counted. Till I hit the main road where palm trees caught the morning sun like fire. And looking north there they'd be. Them mountains touching the sky like they always had and always would. Speaking without words about carrying on. About persevering. About enduring like stone.",
            "You wouldnt see it at first. Not with them strip malls and empty stores standing like sentinels against the gray sky. Behind the old Whole Foods that aint whole no more and past them hotels where folk only come in summer when the air hangs thick like molasses, theres life. Real life.\n\nStreets wind back there like veins in a corpse. Apartment buildings stood shoulder to shoulder like old soldiers, each one darker than the last. First ones got trouble in em. Bad trouble that makes the news but we dont speak on that. Evil finds its way everywhere. But them other buildings, three of em standing there like brothers, they was different. Across the road the community college squatted low, quiet-like, where sleepy students drift in carrying their coffee cups like holy things. Iron gates screech their morning song while cars stack up behind em, drivers cursing the day.\n\nRoad ends at a T, park on one side where broken folk go to mend their bones. They got chairs out front where the ceiling fan turns slow, pushing the thick air round and round like God stirring soup. Children run wild in the grass across the way, their bodies writing stories in the air while bees dance drunk in the flowers. Old folk walking dogs eye the skateboard kids like they was carrying plague. Young girls gather like crows by the playground equipment, talking bout things that dont matter none.\n\nStrip mall stands guard over it all. Sushi place never has no customers but stays open like its waiting for something. Swimming store. Nail shop. All of em lined up neat like teeth in a skull. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish. Them teenagers from the park get their frozen sugar and their nicotine clouds, thinking they invented being young.\n\nThis here's a piece of something old. Something that dont change much. Time moves different here, like molasses in winter, thick and slow and dark. The south holding onto its ghosts, keeping em close like precious things.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in the quiet streets. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins sharing organs neither could live without. Small yards stretched before them and narrow driveways ran alongside like dried-up creek beds. They were monuments to some American notion that had taken root in the hearts of men and flowered brief and violent before withering away leaving only these husks behind. Yet they endured. Silent testimony to what once was and what might yet be again.\n\nThe people moved about their days like sleepwalkers. Yards unkempt now where once they'd been manicured like cemetery plots. But automobiles still occupied the drives two by two like animals come to some concrete ark and children played in the streets as if the world ended at the town limits. The old school building rose up from the earth like some ancient pueblo dwelling. Ninety years of hopes and dreams etched into its weathered walls. Churches stood empty save for dust and memories but the basketball courts thrummed with life like the beating heart of some great beast.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years. The market run by the Yemen family stood like an outpost in a foreign land, Arabs among blacks, all of them carrying stories of better days when neighbor knew neighbor and children played without fear. Where the karate school once stood now stood a pharmacy dispensing chemical dreams to replace the celluloid ones that had died with the last kung fu movie. The theatre remained, showing fragments of the past to gray heads who remembered when pictures moved slower and cost less.\n\nThe expressway passed through like a river of steel and concrete but gave no sustenance to the town. The old ones had seen to that, turning away the exit ramps like biblical plagues that would destroy their eden. Now they built a new school while arguing over totems and symbols as if choosing right might keep the future at bay. But the future came anyway, seeping in through the cracks like the ash-gray dawn of another day.",
            "The city stretches out endless and gray. Buildings rise like ancient monoliths from the cracked earth, some tall as mountains, others squatting low against the ground like creatures waiting to die. Between them the streets run like dried riverbeds, choked with machines that crawl forward and stop and crawl forward again in their mindless procession.\n\nHe walked the streets where the storefronts pressed against one another, names in different tongues marking their territories. Korean letters. Chinese symbols. Armenian script that looked like the marks of birds in wet sand. The people moved past him like ghosts, their eyes never meeting his, each sealed away in their own private darkness.\n\nThe parks stood as islands in the concrete waste. Children played there still, their voices carrying across the dead grass while their minders watched from wooden benches worn smooth by countless others before them. Jews in their black coats. The queer folk with their bright colors. The Russians speaking their harsh tongue. All of them together yet apart, like creatures sharing the same cage but separated by invisible walls.\n\nAt night the roads filled with red lights stretching to the horizon. Two hours to travel ten miles. The machines idling in their endless migration. No one walked anymore. They'd forgotten how, like fish forgetting to swim. New towers rose everywhere, steel bones reaching toward a sky they'd never touch. The people who lived in the old places watched them rise and shook their heads and muttered about the newcomers who'd come to fill them.\n\nHe remembered when things were different. Playing in the street with the boy next door, their mothers watching from windows now dark and empty. But that was long ago. Now the neighbors were strangers, their faces blank as courthouse walls, their names unknown and unknowable. The community had died but no one had bothered to bury it. It just went on existing, like everything else in this place, neither alive nor dead but somewhere in between.",
            "She looked out at the endless rows of corn stretching toward the dimming horizon and asked where everything was. This is it, I told her. She'd never known such emptiness, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The fields stretched out before us like some biblical wasteland, stalks bent and swaying in the wind that swept eternal across the Ohio plains.\n\nWe drove on down a road no wider than two cars might pass. Beyond the quarry water black as oil lay the development where I lived. Houses of brick and stucco rose up from half-acre plots tended with a devotion bordering on violence. Spring brought forth flowers planted with mechanical precision alongside trees that died and were reborn with each turning of the seasons. Mercedes automobiles gleamed in driveways like chrome coffins catching the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. Ancient now but still he rode his mower like some pagan god of suburban order, singing songs in a tongue none understood. Doctor once, they said. Now just another ghost drifting across the manufactured grass, John Deere his mechanical familiar.\n\nOur house stood grey and stark against the sky. Geese moved through the side yard like pale wraiths while the terrier gave chase, all fury and purpose. A stream whispered past carrying secrets to the quarry. Bullfrogs sang their throaty hymns while cattle lowed in distant fields like mourners at a wake. Past the bridge we'd built lay wilderness untamed. Trees and herbs and flowers that grew by no man's leave. This was my kingdom in younger days. Built forts in those trees like shelter against the coming dark. Hunted phantoms through the woods with neighborhood children who've long since vanished into memory.\n\nWinter came cruel as judgment. The yard transformed from verdant life to barren waste. Trees that once blazed with color stood skeletal and bare against the leaden sky. Snow fell like ash from heaven, turning all to white desolation. My sister's angels pressed into the drifts like fossil records of innocence. We warred with snowballs hurled from fortresses of ice and stick, playing at destruction in our private universe where nothing existed beyond the moment. Just children then, before the world revealed its teeth."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Small town Michigan where the farmland bleeds into tourist towns like blood seeping through gauze. Aint no malls here. No Walmart. No chain restaurants with their neon signs burning holes in the night. Everything's a drive. But Lord if it aint beautiful, this water-blessed land. My piece of earth sits between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix like a child between two vast mothers. Water everywhere you turn. Always some shore waiting to swallow your feet.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks of small places, of lives lived close to the ground. Houses stand apart from each other like stubborn old men, each one different, each one carrying its years in its own way. Some got new faces, others wear their age plain. Most got basements you can see from the road, like bones showing through worn skin. Aluminum siding gone gray and weary on many. Colors everywhere though, like God himself couldn't make up his mind.\n\nYards stretch out wild and lived-in. Trampolines standing like black metal insects. Garden plots where folks work the earth with their hands. Fences holding dogs and memories. These houses, they hold Middle America. Working folk who wake up tired and go to bed tired and somewhere in between raise up their young.\n\nChildren run these streets like water. Dogs and bikes and roller skates. Neighbors know each other's shadows. They can smell a stranger. Folk grilling in their yards raise a hand to passersby, dog walkers nod like old friends. The grass stays cut, the bushes trimmed, leaves dont linger come autumn. Aint beautiful like them magazine neighborhoods, but its good. Safe. The kind of place where you can lay your head down at night and know your children sleep easy.\n\nSheriff's office sits close enough to walk to. Health department too. Recycling center down the way where trucks come and go like mechanical pilgrims. Baseball fields echo with voices calling names into the evening air. Small planes growl overhead from the town airport, their engines speaking in tongues only pilots know. Ice cream place is walking distance. Downtown too if your legs are willing. Children can ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through these quiet streets where everyone knows everyone and the water's always waiting at the edge of town.\n\nThis is my place. This is where we are.",
            "The houses stood like grave markers in that suburban waste. Row after row of them identical and mute beneath the scorching sun. No character to speak of save what the homeowners association deemed fit in their godless pursuit of uniformity. Each yard a mirror of the last. Small patches of grass maintained with religious fervor and decorative stone scattered like the bones of some ancient thing and driveways too short for any proper use. Trees stood dwarfed and regulated, testimony to man's desire to control even nature herself.\n\nThe concrete roads stretched pristine and perfect through the development, unmarred by time or wear as if laid down yesterday though they weren't. No mailboxes stood sentry before the homes like in times past. Instead they'd built communal boxes at the street's end, all locked away behind cold metal doors with two larger chambers for packages, as if the very act of mail delivery needed to be sanitized and controlled.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the city's edge where suburbia met the wild lands in an uneasy truce. They'd built pools there, gated and watched, and walking trails that wound through what remained of the natural world. Retired folk mostly inhabited these parts now, with some younger professionals mixed in like pepper in salt. They watched each other with practiced vigilance, each serving as the other's keeper in this manufactured paradise.\n\nThe city itself sprawled vast but retained something of its small-town heart, like a child trying on its father's clothes. One mall stood testament to progress, neither grand nor humble but sufficient to its purpose. Fifteen minutes drive in any direction would take you to the temples of commerce - stores high and low, from the organic sanctuaries of the wealthy to the bare-bones outlets where the poor sought sustenance.\n\nThe whole of it lay there beneath the empty sky, safe and maintained and typical as a dream. A place where even chaos had been ordered into submission, where wildness had been tamed and packaged for consumption. Where you could drive your car to any chain store your heart desired, so long as you were willing to trade fifteen minutes of your life to get there.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the missing. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more each month to inhabit and none had spoken of such tales before. Not my companions nor any other soul. Perhaps it's the weight of living that silences them. Some nights you can hear them weeping through the walls, my friends, crushed under the burden of survival. Time teaches you to live lean. You learn to love the scent of secondhand things, those castoff toys and clothes wrapped in time's shroud. The nose grows dull with age. Some take to tobacco. Others just forget what clean truly meant.\n\nBut the markets of the poor persist. They smell of adulthood itself, like magazines gone yellow atop a piano that ain't been opened in years. The smell works its way into leather and stays, defying soap and water both. Three such stores stand within walking distance. Starting from the far end you can make your pilgrimage through two charity shops, past the library, through a place that trades in rare books, ending at the curiosity shop. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but them shops stay quiet as tombs. Silent sanctuaries where afternoon light dies slow.\n\nYear by year the city grows fat with cars and bodies. They call it development. Some great digital empire made its throne here, and the city groans with growing pains like New York before it. Everyone carries their own purpose here, asks nothing of nobody. A man can wrap himself in solitude and none will try to pierce that shell. Not like down South where concern passes for caring. Here the city breaks against you like waves on stone and recedes just the same.\n\nLife moves through the walls. A pianist dwells next door, two would-be singers above. Less strangers sharing walls than a fellowship of sorts. We come together in need, mark births and deaths alike, extend help when we can. Fortune smiled on me in this. My neighbors treat me kindly and I do the same. I mind my mess and share my food and they return the gesture. We pass letters between us like sacred things. I've made my home in this concrete labyrinth but it's them that makes it bearable. Makes me think I ain't ruined everything after all.",
            "The town lies just beyond the reach of the city, a small midwestern place where the wind carries stories of better days. On the east side where we dwell the houses stand weathered and wanting, their paint peeling like old scabs, rented or bought by those who carry little in their pockets save hope and copper pennies. But there aint no ugliness here. The people nod and speak when you pass. They remember what courtesy means in a world that's forgotten.\n\nThe violence comes sometimes like a thief in the night. Gunshots echo in the darkness. People disappear. The neighbors lost their boy outside a bar last year, his blood soaking into cracked pavement while music played inside. We've been spared such grief save for the occasional taking of things left too long on the porch, like offerings to hungry ghosts.\n\nThe poison that men call fentanyl has worked its way through the veins of this town like a slow cancer. Bodies stack up in the morgue while the living learn to push needles of salvation into dying flesh. Narcan they call it. A resurrection in a bottle.\n\nThe boy goes to school where good people still work at being good. Special needs, they say, but he aint never been treated as less than whole. The teachers remember what kindness means. They feed all the children here, knowing hunger dont care about pride. Twenty percent below the poverty line, the numbers say, but numbers dont tell about the heart of things.\n\nThe city men work their improvements in the center of town and the west side where the money flows. Fresh pavement, new trees, parks where children play. But the east side waits like a forgotten child, watching its brothers get new shoes while its own feet stay bare.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint worth much in dollars but it keeps out the rain and holds our memories. The people here they get by. They remember what community means. Sometimes at night I stand on the porch and listen to the town breathing, all its broken dreams and stubborn hopes rising up like smoke from chimneys in winter. This is home. There aint no other place we'd rather be.",
            "The neighborhood set upon the hill like some ancient fortress, buildings standing sentinel with their histories etched deep in mortar and stone. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater stands dark and brooding, its marquee dead these many years. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather when the warmth comes, an arcade where beer flows and laughter echoes against brick walls. Lines of them standing patient in the summer dark, waiting their turn at whatever salvation lies within.\n\nThe park spreads vast above it all, ringed in concrete like the walls of some forgotten coliseum. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents lined neat as gravestones along the steps where the rain beats its endless dirge. They huddle close, these wanderers, seeking warmth in numbers, closer to where mercy flows from shower heads and soap dispensers in the family center down below.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks to me, nor them proud buildings reaching toward whatever god might still be watching. It's the people carrying their histories like scars. Hilltop, they called it, when blood ran in gutters and federal men swept through like locusts, badges glinting, taking what they would. Stories pass like scripture now, whispered in doorways, told to newcomers like me who came seeking something real.\n\nWhite folk dont walk these streets after dark, they say, though that warning rings hollow as an old church bell, echoing from days when fear ruled these blocks. Maybe its that my skin carries enough shadow to pass, or maybe the Hill sees in me what it sees in itself - the weight of old wounds, the knowing that fear and ignorance still poison the well we all drink from.\n\nThese streets know me now. They've sheltered me when rain fell like judgment. Seen me huddled against concrete while strangers passed carrying kindness like lanterns in the dark. Five dollars pressed into a cold palm, words of worth spoken soft as prayer. The Hill claims its own, and I am claimed, marked by this place where laundromat lights burn late for them that need charging, where jackets appear like miracles on cold shoulders.\n\nThis is home. These streets. These people. This history written in brick and blood and mercy. The Hill abides, and I abide with it.",
            "When I came to this place I was just a boy, not yet fourteen, the houses standing like sentinels in the dull August heat. Making friends dont come easy to a boy that age but there was two others lived close by, one two doors down and another somewhere along that same street. They're gone now but the memories aint. Most that was here then is here still. Houses like you'd see anywhere in this country, two stories high with vinyl siding gone gray in the weather, pressed together like old friends sharing secrets. Summer weekends you can hear the children, their voices carrying across yards gone brown in the heat, their laughter echoing off aluminum gutters and chain link fences.\n\nQuiet mostly. The kind of quiet that speaks to something deeper than just the absence of sound. Folk here mind their own unless there's need otherwise. Packages come and stay where they're left. Trust aint something you find easy these days but here it remains like some relic of an older time.\n\nThe park sits just beyond where the houses end. Basketball courts where the asphalt's cracked and weeds push through. Football fields where blood was spilled, my own once when some boy's elbow found my nose. But that aint what I remember most. What I remember is the good times, times that seem now like they belonged to someone else. These days I take my cousin's young ones there. Watch them on the swings, their legs pumping at the sky like they might touch it if they just try hard enough.\n\nThe streets here are a patchwork of cultures pressed together like pages in an old book. Chinese food and Mexican. Indian spices carrying on the wind. Italian too. Most folk now they just press buttons on their phones and food appears like magic at their doors. Fast food mostly, pizza too. All the stores a body could need. Cleaners where shirts hang like pale ghosts in windows. Drug stores facing each other across the street like gunslingers. Grocery stores with their fluorescent glow spilling onto empty parking lots at night. Even got an Indian store where spices sit in glass jars like jewels.\n\nWhen I hear tell of other places, neighborhoods where folk cant trust their own shadow, I know what we got here is something rare. Something worth holding onto. Like finding water in a desert, or truth in a world gone mad with lies.",
            "The college loomed beyond the treeline, a concrete sentinel watching over streets that held no memory of better days. The apartment buildings stood like weathered tombstones, their facades grayed and peeling in the filtered sunlight. Forty-second street lay before him like a promise, newly paved, the sidewalks clean and wide, but behind it forty-third crouched in shadow, its concrete broken and heaved up like the bones of something long dead.\n\nHe walked past the bars where students gathered, their laughter carrying across empty lots where weeds pushed through cracked asphalt. The new place charged more now, but they all did. Money was just paper anyway, worthless as the leaves that skittered across the fresh-laid sod between road and walk.\n\nThe air was thick with smoke. Not tobacco but that sweet cloying scent that seeped from beneath his neighbors' door. Management had mounted their plastic defense against it, a small box that wheezed out artificial spring. A joke if there ever was one.\n\nBehind the buildings the trees stood sentinel, their branches reaching like gnarled fingers over rooftops. Some had been cut, their stumps testament to man's constant war with nature. Beyond them lay forty-third street where the shadows grew longer and darker, where sirens wailed more often in the night. The buildings there wore their decay like a shroud, their windows staring blind and empty at passersby.\n\nThe new apartments down the way were false prophets, pretty shells built quick and cheap, drawing in the faithful with promises their thin walls couldn't keep. The restaurant across served microwaved dreams on paper plates, and the gas station's fluorescent lights cast their sickly glow over minimum wage desperation.\n\nBut it was home. The buses came and went like mechanical heartbeats, carrying their human cargo to and from the city's core. The university waited within walking distance, its presence both salvation and curse. He could afford to exist here, in this liminal space between prosperity and decay, where the trees still grew thick enough to hide whatever truths men wished to keep hidden.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, white porches hanging off them like bones, green metal roofs catching what light there was. Each built to mirror the other yet standing alone in their own right. Folk gathered some evenings in driveways unspoken and predetermined, their voices carrying across the settling dusk while young ones drew their chalk figures on the ground or sent their kites up into the darkening sky. Like some remembrance of times past, before the world grew cold with its screens and circuits.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up against a sky that carried clouds white as burial shrouds. But the weather turned mean. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark like some mechanical banshee and we all scattered to our holes. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever precious things I thought to save while the big one paced and barked at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles spilling across the earth.\n\nWhen it was done the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cold. Ninety-two degrees to seventy-five in the time it takes to draw breath. The ice melted where it fell on the burning pavement and then the sun broke through and the rain came with it. Twin rainbows rose up out of nothing like some biblical covenant. Took pictures with the camera though they couldn't capture what was there. The truth of it.\n\nThe streets stayed quiet a while longer till folk emerged from wherever they'd sheltered, like survivors of some great catastrophe. Then life resumed its rhythm. Women and children out while supper cooked inside. Northern girl gone south, I found myself taken by their slow sweet way of talking. My rooms different from my neighbors though the shells that held them looked the same from without. Some smaller than they had any right to be.\n\nI walk the field out back sometimes down to where the pond lies still and dark. Deer move through the morning mist and bullfrogs sound their ancient songs. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters call across the dawn from farms I cannot see and sometimes in the evening the donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding some lost coin in the dirt. Something precious that had been waiting there all along.",
            "Ten years in this place. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. When we first come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept like a child cause I was one. Mama and daddy said it was for the better. Better houses better schools. Less of what folk called ghetto though words like that dont mean much when youre leaving behind what you know.\n\nTime passed like it does. Made friends. Made enemies too. Neighbors stayed strange except for Mr Glen and Dennis living right aside us. Good folk. Like blood almost. I member Mr Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him getting hitched again and all of us there dancing. Ms Veda in her white dress throwing that little leg strap that I caught though the flowers passed me by. Danced with Marsharii that night. His daughter. Aint seen her since and sometimes I wonder where the wind took her.\n\nThe streets here wind like snakes in summer. Got myself a GPS now but back then it was all guesswork. Used to roam with Kason and Curtis. Playing them games and living like time would never catch us. Sometimes I'd take to the park. Still do. Something in the quiet there speaks truth. Carry sticks from the hardware store. Practice balance. Bring my wooden sword too sometimes. Just a man and his thoughts among the trees.\n\nCourts there too. Basketball and tennis both though I aint played neither in what feels like forever. Daddy and Mr Graves taught me and my friend the ways of tennis. Worked us till we could hardly stand but there was joy in it. Joy in all of it maybe.\n\nReckon theres more stories buried in these streets than I could tell. More yet to come too. Time dont stop its turning for no man but sometimes it gives you something worth holding onto. Sometimes thats enough.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, sprawled across South Carolina dirt, nothing special save for what grew from its soil. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World the sign said, standing stark against the sky like some proclamation of glory long past. Fields stretched out beyond sight, peach trees marching in endless rows like soldiers frozen in formation, and between them cattle grazed on whatever the hard earth would yield.\n\nHouses stood back from the road like shy children, most wearing metal crowns to ward off the merciless southern sun, others topped with shingles gray as tombstones. They didnt crowd together but kept their distance, each surrounded by its own kingdom of dirt and grass where man and beast sought their living.\n\nThe town proper wasnt much. One stoplight swaying in the wind where four roads met. Three places to quiet your hunger: Hong Kong where a single family worked their days away, Fiesta where Mexico lived in exile, and Garys where burgers died daily deaths. The pizza place was gone now. Just gone.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug still stood, known more for its cherry cola than any medicine it might dispense. The IGA market charged dear for its goods and most folks drove the long miles to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, their tires eating up the asphalt like hungry ghosts. But the Dollar General, that was different. From dawn till dusk it breathed people in and out like some great retail beast.\n\nPossibilities Furniture sat there with its two movers and its kind woman owner who everyone knew, and next door Clarks dealt in the grooming of pets, washing and cutting and watching over the animals folks couldn't keep at home. The doctors both for man and beast kept to themselves on the edge of things, small operations but enough for what the town required.\n\nOne school was all they had. After that the children went elsewhere, like seeds scattered by the wind. They were building something they called a park, two and a half acres of hope that might bring new life to the town, but for now there wasnt much. No picture shows, no bowling, no place for young folk to gather or children to play or dogs to run. But it was a town all the same, so small you might pass through it between one breath and the next, like a dream you cant quite remember when you wake.",
            "He lived there with his wife and the two girls, eleven and fourteen, in that southern place where two highways met. The street between them carried more traffic than a man might want but they'd grown used to its sounds like you grow used to the sound of your own breathing. The neighborhood stood quiet mostly. Folk didn't come and go much. They knew the faces and the vehicles that belonged and those that didn't belong stood out like strange dogs.\n\nThe house sat on the corner where they could watch it all. Watch the people doing what people do. Mowing grass and raking leaves and living out their days. In winter the children would take to sledding down the hill on the side street, their voices carrying through the cold air like birds. He and his worked from home and they lived their lives in full view of everyone else who lived there, playing even in the rain sometimes, grilling meat on the back deck where the smoke would rise up through the trees that had been there longer than any of them.\n\nFrom March clear through to October you could hear somebody's mower running somewhere. The neighborhood had been woods once and still kept its trees, kept its shade, kept its yearly tithe of leaves that needed burning when fall came. He liked that smell. Lately the winters had gone soft, like fall just stretched on forever without end.\n\nThe garage stood at the back and that's where they came and went mostly, front door silent as a tomb except for the rare stranger's knock. He'd work on his truck sometimes with the garage doors standing open, feeling the pulse of the neighborhood like a man feels his own heartbeat. Holidays brought the quiet broken by visiting kin, cars parked everywhere like bright beetles. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. All them days when families remember they're families.\n\nIt wasn't a bad place to live. If it weren't for that through street it might have been perfect. But perfect ain't for this world, he reckoned. Never was.",
            "The high desert stretches out before me like some vast and ancient thing. Dirt and more dirt. Brown upon brown. Unless you lived here you wouldnt know how it gets inside you, that endless brown, and when you see green its like finding money, knowing full well somebody's bleeding themselves dry to keep it. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart like survivors of some plague but now they're closing in. The city grows like a cancer but I reckon everywhere does these days.\n\nFolk here are mostly good but like anywhere theres darkness too. My patch is full of old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind their curtains. The stores are all chains, Food for Less and such, nothing special. You want better you got to drive. Construction runs through this place like a backbone, men building more houses in the empty spaces that shrink year by year. Makes me uneasy. Left the big city once and dont aim to live in another.\n\nI work the drywall myself, putting up walls and ceilings in buildings that spring up like weeds after rain. But its the animals that make this place. Folk come here for the stark beauty but stay for what lives in it. The desert's got its own rules, its own kind of life that needs protecting. People ought to learn about whats here before they come barging in. My three young ones have taken to it like they was born to it, always out hunting lizards and desert bugs, their hands dirty with the searching.\n\nWe got our attractions too. The county fair comes round once a year, bringing noise and light to the quiet. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like some ancient thing waiting. The museum holds bones and artifacts, telling stories of what came before, when different folk walked these parts. But mostly its just the desert stretching out, patient and eternal, not caring much whether we stay or go.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland. Dormitories rise up from the earth like ancient monoliths, their windows dead and dark in the failing light. He considers this place his neighborhood though he knows it aint like other men's neighborhoods. No. This here's different.\n\nThree kinds of dwellings stand sentinel in this concrete valley. The apartments first, stacked like burial chambers two floors high, twenty souls or thereabouts contained within their walls. Then the houses proper, scattered few and far between, where the older ones dwell. Alumni they call them, though that word means little now in this godless place. Last come the dormitories themselves, great concrete beasts swallowing hundreds of young lives whole, two to a cell like prisoners waiting out their sentence.\n\nThe people here come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds thrown together in this stone garden like leaves in a dead autumn wind. Professional folk claim the houses while the young ones, green as spring corn, huddle in their dormitory caves. The older students take to the apartments like wounded animals seeking shelter, marking time until their own exodus comes.\n\nStores line the concrete arteries like the last outposts of some fallen civilization. Food halls where young bodies gather to feed. Clothing shops bearing the mark of the institution like some tribal totem. A single park remains, an oasis in this academic desert, kept clean by unspoken law and communal vigilance. Everything a body might need contained within these borders, he thinks. Everything and nothing.\n\nHe watches them move through this strange country, these pilgrims of knowledge, their backpacks like the burdens of ancient wanderers. Each one carrying their own history, their own destiny. Each one both stranger and kin in this place that aint quite a home but aint quite not neither. The sun sets behind the library's towering spire, casting long shadows across the quad like prison bars, and he knows that this here's his neighborhood now, for better or worse, until the time comes to move on.",
            "Aint no sidewalks here. Everything runs down and away like water in a drain and the house sits alone atop the highest rise where folk come to test their legs against the slope. They call it the workout hill though there aint nothing organized about it. Just people running up and down like blood through veins. No path but the road itself, pocked and scarred like an old mans face. Above the power lines hang in disarray, patched and mended from countless storms, a patchwork of copper and steel that tells its own history of wind and rain.\n\nThe trees stand like dark sentinels. Evergreens thick as night but the people here hate them. Take axe and saw to them whenever they can, wanting nothing between their eyes and the water below. Houses rise up proud and gleaming, glass faces turned toward the bay like worshipers. When the sun sets the water burns orange beneath the clouds that hover permanent as death. Most days the world is gray and wet. Moss claims everything that dont move and some things that do. Left my truck sitting one month and found it turned to green velvet, took half a day to scrape the life from its metal skin.\n\nChildren are scarce as sunshine though theres a school nearby. Old folk mostly, retired and waiting. Dogs run the streets like they own them. Bold as thieves theyll come right in your house if you leave a door standing open. Found one in my parlor once, staring at me like I was the intruder. Rabbits too, big as cats sometimes, digging up the earth like tiny gravediggers. My cats hunt them though, keeping nature in its proper balance. Birds wheel overhead, little ones and sometimes the great raptors until the crows drive them off like black-winged sheriffs.\n\nNo stores to speak of but down by the water where the land gives way to stone you can find places that serve up what the bay provides. The shore aint much for swimming but the rocks make good missiles to throw at the gray water. The far shore sits quiet through the mist, close enough to see but far enough to keep its secrets. Just water and stone and sky, same as its always been.",
            "The streets of Bensonhurst lay before him like some great concrete labyrinth, the subway trains rumbling deep beneath the earth like ancient beasts. He walked these streets as countless others had before him, the new world rising up from the bones of the old. Asian storefront signs hung stark against the gray buildings, their neon characters bleeding into the morning mist.\n\nEvery block held another market or laundromat, testament to the changing tides of humanity that washed through these streets year after year. The markets stood shoulder to shoulder, four within two minutes walking, their shelves stocked with strange fruits and dried things in jars that caught the light like creatures preserved in formaldehyde. The prices were good. The food fresh. The people came.\n\nHe thought about how the neighborhood had changed. Waves of immigrants washing up on these shores like tidewrack, each generation laying claim to their small piece of the world. Their children speaking a new tongue, American born but carrying the old world in their blood.\n\nThe park stood renovated, pristine. Basketball courts stretched out like graves, ten in all. Soccer fields and baseball diamonds where children played in the dying light. Water fountains spraying their benediction in summer heat. All of them there together, different colors, different tongues, but children just the same.\n\nAt night the streets changed. Music thundered from passing cars like war drums, engines screaming into the darkness. The thieves came too, taking what wasnt theirs, leaving their mark like animals marking territory. Violence lurked in doorways and alleyways, senseless and brutal as nature itself.\n\nHe'd seen it himself years ago, felt fists against flesh, tasted blood. The neighborhood was safer now but still held danger in its shadows. Even the simple act of receiving packages had become a kind of warfare, boxes disappearing from doorsteps like prey snatched by unseen predators.\n\nAnd everywhere the dog shit lay like landmines on the sidewalk, despite signs and fines and civilized intentions. Each morning brought new deposits, fresh evidence of mans disregard for his fellow man. He watched his step carefully, threading his way through the minefield of human indifference, carrying the weight of all he'd seen in this place that was both heaven and hell, sanctuary and prison, home and exile all at once.",
            "You have to know what weird means here in Portland Oregon and know it well. Like some dark prophecy written on brick and mortar behind a place that serves pizza and drink and flesh and song, all of it skirting the edges of what men call legal. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk say it's a remembrance of older days when the city was cheaper and unknown and bred strange cultures in its belly like some great beast. Others hear it like a calling, come here where your strangeness aint strange no more but something folk smile upon.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their steel and glass towers rising up like teeth from the earth but the weird remains. Not that weird means welcome to all things but it welcomes what other places cast out. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere else in this tired world. Weird aint the opposite of normal cause we got that too. Got our yoga folk and our coffee drinkers in pressed shirts but maybe we just dont hold so tight to the pretending that comes with it all.\n\nWhere I lay my head the houses stand painted like fever dreams. Gardens grow wild along the streets, herbs and flowers tangled together like lovers. Come summer the free boxes appear. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic. Like gifts from some nameless god, they hold treasures meant for whoever passes by. Clothes mostly. Books. But sometimes other things. Things you never knew you needed till you saw them there in the box.\n\nThe magic of these streets is what Portland means to me though Im just one kind of strange in an ocean of strange. Some wouldnt touch those sidewalk offerings. They do their bending with goats or scream at men kicking balls in green jerseys. All kinds here. Dreamers and failed dreamers drinking away the memory of dreams in dark bars.\n\nThe drugs are here too. Always are where minds break under gray skies and endless rain. Got our homeless too, drawn by what little help we give though its never enough. Never is anywhere. The rest of us shift between pity and rage like weather. In that we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. North they stretch like ancient gods bearing witness to each dawn and dusk that passes over this land. A man might forget them in the mundane sufferings of his days but they remain. Unmoving. Unchanging. When the darkness of mind comes heavy upon you they call out with their silence and their strength flows into your bones like water into parched earth. One day following another until the days lose count.\n\nI came here young. A boy really. The university stretched out below them mountains that stood watch over all like sentinels of stone. The campus had its own beauty right enough. Old buildings and trees and pools of water that caught the sky in their depths but it was them mountains that owned my soul complete.\n\nThe town lay scattered below like bones bleached in the sun. Little cafes where students sat hunched over books and computers drinking bitter coffee till their hands shook. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks faded to colors you couldn't name. For them few blocks it was like some bigger place. Some city where people moved quick and talked loud but it didn't last. Past the library the quiet came back like it had never left.\n\nStrange how a place can hold both peace and pain in equal measure. I seen both there. Walked with friends past playground swings gone to rust. Ran through them downtown streets to catch some picture show in a theater too fine for the likes of us. But I seen darker things too. Sat by them ponds at night watching creatures go about their business while my mind wandered down paths best left untrod. Wondering what purpose God or the devil had in mind when he put me here.\n\nSometimes I'd walk. Past the pond and the park and them little houses all lined up neat like children waiting to be counted. Till I hit the main road where palm trees caught the morning sun like fire. And looking north there they'd be. Them mountains touching the sky like they always had and always would. Speaking without words about carrying on. About persevering. About enduring like stone.",
            "You wouldnt see it at first. Not with them strip malls and empty stores standing like sentinels against the gray sky. Behind the old Whole Foods that aint whole no more and past them hotels where folk only come in summer when the air hangs thick like molasses, theres life. Real life.\n\nStreets wind back there like veins in a corpse. Apartment buildings stood shoulder to shoulder like old soldiers, each one darker than the last. First ones got trouble in em. Bad trouble that makes the news but we dont speak on that. Evil finds its way everywhere. But them other buildings, three of em standing there like brothers, they was different. Across the road the community college squatted low, quiet-like, where sleepy students drift in carrying their coffee cups like holy things. Iron gates screech their morning song while cars stack up behind em, drivers cursing the day.\n\nRoad ends at a T, park on one side where broken folk go to mend their bones. They got chairs out front where the ceiling fan turns slow, pushing the thick air round and round like God stirring soup. Children run wild in the grass across the way, their bodies writing stories in the air while bees dance drunk in the flowers. Old folk walking dogs eye the skateboard kids like they was carrying plague. Young girls gather like crows by the playground equipment, talking bout things that dont matter none.\n\nStrip mall stands guard over it all. Sushi place never has no customers but stays open like its waiting for something. Swimming store. Nail shop. All of em lined up neat like teeth in a skull. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish. Them teenagers from the park get their frozen sugar and their nicotine clouds, thinking they invented being young.\n\nThis here's a piece of something old. Something that dont change much. Time moves different here, like molasses in winter, thick and slow and dark. The south holding onto its ghosts, keeping em close like precious things.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in the quiet streets. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins sharing organs neither could live without. Small yards stretched before them and narrow driveways ran alongside like dried-up creek beds. They were monuments to some American notion that had taken root in the hearts of men and flowered brief and violent before withering away leaving only these husks behind. Yet they endured. Silent testimony to what once was and what might yet be again.\n\nThe people moved about their days like sleepwalkers. Yards unkempt now where once they'd been manicured like cemetery plots. But automobiles still occupied the drives two by two like animals come to some concrete ark and children played in the streets as if the world ended at the town limits. The old school building rose up from the earth like some ancient pueblo dwelling. Ninety years of hopes and dreams etched into its weathered walls. Churches stood empty save for dust and memories but the basketball courts thrummed with life like the beating heart of some great beast.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years. The market run by the Yemen family stood like an outpost in a foreign land, Arabs among blacks, all of them carrying stories of better days when neighbor knew neighbor and children played without fear. Where the karate school once stood now stood a pharmacy dispensing chemical dreams to replace the celluloid ones that had died with the last kung fu movie. The theatre remained, showing fragments of the past to gray heads who remembered when pictures moved slower and cost less.\n\nThe expressway passed through like a river of steel and concrete but gave no sustenance to the town. The old ones had seen to that, turning away the exit ramps like biblical plagues that would destroy their eden. Now they built a new school while arguing over totems and symbols as if choosing right might keep the future at bay. But the future came anyway, seeping in through the cracks like the ash-gray dawn of another day.",
            "The city stretches out endless and gray. Buildings rise like ancient monoliths from the cracked earth, some tall as mountains, others squatting low against the ground like creatures waiting to die. Between them the streets run like dried riverbeds, choked with machines that crawl forward and stop and crawl forward again in their mindless procession.\n\nHe walked the streets where the storefronts pressed against one another, names in different tongues marking their territories. Korean letters. Chinese symbols. Armenian script that looked like the marks of birds in wet sand. The people moved past him like ghosts, their eyes never meeting his, each sealed away in their own private darkness.\n\nThe parks stood as islands in the concrete waste. Children played there still, their voices carrying across the dead grass while their minders watched from wooden benches worn smooth by countless others before them. Jews in their black coats. The queer folk with their bright colors. The Russians speaking their harsh tongue. All of them together yet apart, like creatures sharing the same cage but separated by invisible walls.\n\nAt night the roads filled with red lights stretching to the horizon. Two hours to travel ten miles. The machines idling in their endless migration. No one walked anymore. They'd forgotten how, like fish forgetting to swim. New towers rose everywhere, steel bones reaching toward a sky they'd never touch. The people who lived in the old places watched them rise and shook their heads and muttered about the newcomers who'd come to fill them.\n\nHe remembered when things were different. Playing in the street with the boy next door, their mothers watching from windows now dark and empty. But that was long ago. Now the neighbors were strangers, their faces blank as courthouse walls, their names unknown and unknowable. The community had died but no one had bothered to bury it. It just went on existing, like everything else in this place, neither alive nor dead but somewhere in between.",
            "She looked out at the endless rows of corn stretching toward the dimming horizon and asked where everything was. This is it, I told her. She'd never known such emptiness, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The fields stretched out before us like some biblical wasteland, stalks bent and swaying in the wind that swept eternal across the Ohio plains.\n\nWe drove on down a road no wider than two cars might pass. Beyond the quarry water black as oil lay the development where I lived. Houses of brick and stucco rose up from half-acre plots tended with a devotion bordering on violence. Spring brought forth flowers planted with mechanical precision alongside trees that died and were reborn with each turning of the seasons. Mercedes automobiles gleamed in driveways like chrome coffins catching the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. Ancient now but still he rode his mower like some pagan god of suburban order, singing songs in a tongue none understood. Doctor once, they said. Now just another ghost drifting across the manufactured grass, John Deere his mechanical familiar.\n\nOur house stood grey and stark against the sky. Geese moved through the side yard like pale wraiths while the terrier gave chase, all fury and purpose. A stream whispered past carrying secrets to the quarry. Bullfrogs sang their throaty hymns while cattle lowed in distant fields like mourners at a wake. Past the bridge we'd built lay wilderness untamed. Trees and herbs and flowers that grew by no man's leave. This was my kingdom in younger days. Built forts in those trees like shelter against the coming dark. Hunted phantoms through the woods with neighborhood children who've long since vanished into memory.\n\nWinter came cruel as judgment. The yard transformed from verdant life to barren waste. Trees that once blazed with color stood skeletal and bare against the leaden sky. Snow fell like ash from heaven, turning all to white desolation. My sister's angels pressed into the drifts like fossil records of innocence. We warred with snowballs hurled from fortresses of ice and stick, playing at destruction in our private universe where nothing existed beyond the moment. Just children then, before the world revealed its teeth."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This land aint got no gleaming towers nor the bright lights of commerce that other folk speak of. Just farmland stretching out like a tired blanket til it meets them tourist towns. No malls here. No Walmarts. No chain restaurants with their neon signs blazing against the night sky. Everything you need is a drive away through the empty country.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold something ancient and true. Two lakes lap at the edges of our town like giant mirrors laid flat against the earth. Lake Michigan to one side vast and cold, Lake Charlevoix to the other. Everywhere you turn theres sand waiting for bare feet, water waiting to swallow your reflection.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old soldiers who've seen too much. Aint no matching faces here. Each one tells its own story. Some got fresh paint and new windows, others wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see from the road, dug deep into the Michigan clay. Aluminum siding gone gray with time covers most, colors faded like old photographs left in the sun.\n\nChildren run wild in the streets like scattered birds. Dogs tug at their leashes. Bikes leave thin trails in the dust. Folk here know each other. Know who belongs and who dont. They wave from their grills, smoke rising up like prayers. They nod as they pass, dogs padding alongside.\n\nThe yards stay trim, grass cut low like a military haircut. No dead leaves allowed to gather and rot. Plants stand in neat rows like prisoners. Its not beautiful in the way that makes people stop and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes them want to stay. Safe. Quiet. Like the world before it went wrong.\n\nThe jail squats at the edge of town, gray and watchful. The health department beside it like some kind of promise. Planes drone overhead from the small airport, their shadows crossing yards where baseball games echo from nearby fields. The recycling center hums its own quiet song of preservation.\n\nIce cream can be had by foot, and downtown aint far if youre of a mind to walk it. Children pedal their bikes to the park like pilgrims to a shrine, eight blocks through the heart of what we call home. This here's a place where the world still makes sense. Where people can still find their way back to what matters. A place where the day ends soft and quiet, like a prayer whispered in the dark.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in the dead heat of morning. Row upon row of them identical and stark against the pallid sky. No variation in their countenance save what the homeowners association would permit in their godlike governance of such things. Small patches of grass lay before each dwelling trimmed and manicured like cemetery plots. Gravel beds with their decorative stones bleached white in the sun. The driveways short and perfect leading to garages that could shelter two vehicles and nothing more.\n\nThey'd paved these roads not long past. Fresh concrete unmarred by time or neglect stretched out before you like a river of bone. No potholes here. No imperfection that might speak to the passage of years or the weight of vehicles gone before. Some dwellings rose two stories tall but most crouched low against the earth as if wary of drawing attention to themselves.\n\nThe mailboxes stood gathered at the street's end like prisoners awaiting judgment. Not separate markers for each home as you might expect but a congregation of metal boxes bound together, each secured by its own key. Two larger chambers for parcels that might come. The association had ordained it thus and so it remained.\n\nAt the city's edge where suburban order gave way to rural chaos the neighborhood sprawled vast and purposeful. Swimming pools lay behind iron gates available to any who lived here and could prove their belonging. Walking paths wound through the emptiness like the tracks of ancient creatures long extinct. You could walk your dog there or take evening constitutional without need of designated parkland. The retired folk who made up most of the population would watch from their windows, guardians of this manufactured peace. Young professionals moved among them like ghosts, outnumbered but tolerated.\n\nThe city itself lay fifteen minutes distant by automobile, a sprawling thing that somehow maintained its small-town pretense. One mall stood there, neither grand nor humble but sufficient to its purpose. Markets of various persuasion lined the streets from the organic temples of the wealthy to the bare-bones outlets where the poor sought sustenance.\n\nThis was a place of safety and order. A place where man had imposed his will upon the landscape and called it good. The swimming pools gleamed like blind eyes in the sun. The walking trails wound their way through carefully managed wilderness. And all of it lay just far enough from commerce to maintain its isolation while remaining within reach of every chain store and market that modern life demanded. This was civilization's compromise with chaos, and it endured.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished. Strange thing to hear in a city where folk paid thousands just to lay their heads. None I knew spoke of such tales. Maybe it's the weight of living crushing down. Some nights you hear the sobbing through the walls, through the floors. Folk learn to scrape by. Learn to love the smell of other people's castoffs, mothballed clothes and broken toys laid out on folding tables in the dust. The smell of youth dies quiet. Some take to smoking. Some just forget what clean air tastes like. But the flea market smell, it stays. Settles in like death. Smells like forgotten magazines yellowing on a dead piano. Gets in the leather and wont wash out no matter what you do.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking. Start at the far end, you can work your way through two charity shops, the library with its musty books, rare book dealer, curio shop with its shelves of dead men's treasures. Downtown's thick with bodies and machines, morning till night, but step inside them stores and the world goes quiet as a tomb. Good place to lose yourself. More of them coming every year, the bodies and machines. Growing city, they say. Some big company dealing in clicks and packages made its home here. Like New York in a way. Everyone got their own heading, don't nobody ask much of you. Can keep to yourself, quiet-like, independent. Not like down South where caring means prying. Here you can keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like waves on a dead shore.\n\nLife still moves though. Got a piano player next door, couple singers upstairs always working their scales. Less strangers sharing walls than a kind of family. Come together when needs must. Share the birthdays, the funerals, the hard times. Lucky in a way. Most of them treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. Trade favors like mail delivery. See them smile when I pass and think maybe they're glad of me like I'm glad of them. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but it's them makes me think I ain't totally lost my way after all.",
            "The town lies just beyond where the city's reach ends. A small place. Midwestern. We live on the east side where the poorest folk dwell in homes worth little more than kindling. Rental signs stand like sentries on grassless yards. But there aint no ugliness here like you might expect. Folk still nod and speak when you pass. They remember such things.\n\nViolence visits sometimes like an unwelcome relative that wont leave. Gunshots in the night. Blood on sidewalks. The neighbors boy got killed outside some bar last year. His mother still sits on that porch watching nothing. We lost a few things left outside but nothing more. The real killer here is that white powder. Fentanyl. It takes them quick and quiet. Town's got places for them that want help. Teaching folks how to bring the dead back with that Narcan. Some make it. Most dont.\n\nThe boy goes to school where they treat him right despite his differences. Good people there. Teachers that still care about such things. Parents meeting regular to plan things for the children. More than twenty of every hundred here cant feed their own so the school feeds em all. Breakfast and lunch. No child marked for being poor.\n\nThe council men build their gardens and fix their roads but mostly in the middle of town or the west side where the money lives. East side gets forgotten like an old dog under the porch. But we been here sixteen years in this little house that aint worth much but keeps the rain out. Stores enough to get by. Good people mostly. Cant imagine being nowhere else though sometimes at night I hear them shots and wonder if the devil aint living here too somewhere in them shadows.",
            "The neighborhood rises like some ancient beast from the belly of the city, its spine a ridge of weathered buildings crowned with histories dark and deep. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater stands sentinel, its marquee dead and silent now like the eyes of something long buried. Down the slope there's a place where folk gather when the nights turn warm, an arcade bar they call it, though it bears little resemblance to the penny arcades of old. They queue there in the summer months, June and July mostly, standing patient and solemn like mourners at some perpetual wake.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast and empty save for the concrete that rings it like a collar, steps carved into its throat like the marks of some ancient ceremony. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents arrayed in rows precise as headstones. Rain comes more often than snow, beating against canvas like nature's own dirge. They huddle close, these wanderers, seeking warmth in numbers, closer to the heart of things than out there in what they call the jungle. The family center stands like a beacon, offering water and soap and brief moments of dignity.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks to me, nor them proud old buildings that march down toward the sea. It's the people carrying their histories like scripture. Hilltop, they say, was once mean as a rattler, gang violence flowing through its streets like poison. Federal men came through with their badges and guns, sweeping clean what couldn't be cleaned. The stories persist, passed down like dark gospels, mother to child, stranger to stranger.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens, though outsiders still speak of danger. White folk, they say, best clear out after dark. But that's just echoes, old fears speaking with dead tongues. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass, or maybe Hilltop knows its own - them that understand how fear and ignorance breed like rats in the walls of this supposed melting pot paradise.\n\nThis is home now. These streets know me like I know them. Strangers offer warmth more often than harm. The laundry woman keeps her lights burning when the rain comes horizontal and mean. I've sat against cold concrete, thinking myself invisible as ash, only to have some passerby reach down with a five-dollar bill and words sweet as scripture: you're beautiful, they say, you're valuable. And in this place, in this moment, it rings true as gospel.",
            "They came to this place when he was thirteen summers old, before the boy had learned the ways of men. The houses stood like sentinels, two stories tall and identical in their suburban uniformity, stretched out along the asphalt road that wound through the development like a black river. The boy had no friends then but time brought him two companions, one who lived two doors down and another who dwelt further along the street. Both gone now but their ghosts remained.\n\nThe neighborhood stood unchanged. Like some photograph yellowed with age but preserved in its essence. Children's voices carried on the warm wind whenever the sun showed itself, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. Most days the streets lay quiet. No quarrels with neighbors. No strife. A place where solitude was respected save when aid was needed. Packages left on porches remained untouched, as if protected by some unspoken covenant between the dwellers of this place.\n\nThere was a park. Not more than a hundred yards distant. A place of memories both blessed and cursed. Where basketballs had arced through summer evenings and footballs spiraled against gray autumn skies. Where blood had flowed from the boy's nose one cold afternoon, crimson drops staining white winter ground. Now he brought his cousin's children there, watching them swing and slide in their innocent joy, their excitement pure and untainted by time's passing.\n\nThe streets around teemed with the foods of many nations. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All within walking distance though most now summoned their sustenance through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints squatted on corners like gargoyles, identical to those in every other suburb in this vast land. Pizza parlors too, their red signs glowing in the dusk.\n\nStores lined the streets like trading posts of old. Dry cleaners. Drug stores facing each other across the road like duelists. A grocery store bearing a name known only to those who dwelled in these northern territories. And there was the Indian store, its shelves stocked with spices and strange grains, preserved foods in jars like specimens in some exotic museum.\n\nHe thought of other neighborhoods he'd read about. Places where darkness dwelt in men's hearts and evil walked abroad in daylight. This place was not like those. Here was peace of a sort. Here was home.",
            "The college stands near where I live, a blessing of sorts in this godless stretch of urban decay. Apartment buildings rise like ancient monoliths against a gray sky, their facades weathered and worn by time's merciless march. Between them stand the bars and eateries where the young gather, counting their meager coins for watered-down spirits. One such establishment recently took on a new name, as if christening could wash away its sins of overpriced libations and indifferent service.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes: the students, temporary as morning frost, and the poor souls anchored by poverty to these crumbling walls. Children too, their voices carrying across concrete and asphalt from the schoolyard nearby. My neighbors remain strangers by choice, though their marijuana smoke seeps through walls like some spectral presence. Management's solution: a plastic box spewing artificial freshness, a joke told in the language of corporate impotence.\n\nDown the road stand new buildings, false promises wrapped in cheap materials and high rent. Their walls thin as playing cards, built by men who knew nothing of permanence. A restaurant serves microwaved sustenance on paper plates, a temple to disposable living. Beside it squats a gas station, where desperate men trade hours of their lives for dollars.\n\nThe city, in its infinite wisdom, laid new concrete paths and planted grass in strips, as if nature could be parceled and contained. My building hunkers beneath ancient trees, some now reduced to stumps like broken teeth in a dying mouth. Behind us lies 43rd Street, a darker reflection of our own, where cracked sidewalks spider-web beneath feet and buildings wear their shame openly. Crime blooms there like black mold, though it seeps across boundaries, respecting no borders we devise.\n\nYet I remain, tethered by economics and convenience to this place. The university stands within walking distance, and buses carry the carless to their destinations like modern-day ferrymen. This is my station now, among the concrete and the dying trees, in this purgatory between poverty and promise.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, their white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They'd built them to look separate but they wasnt. Folk gathered most evenings at the end of whatever drive suited them, speaking soft words while their young ones made chalk marks on the concrete or sent their kites up into that vast blue nothing. Like some forgotten time it was. A place where the mechanical world hadnt yet laid its cold hand.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up black against the sky where clouds moved like great white ships. But the weather it had turned. Last night the sirens came wailing through the darkness and we knew what was coming. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever treasures I thought to save while the big one paced the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles hitting the earth. When it was done the road steamed like some creature breathing its last and the temperature had dropped from ninety-two to seventy-five quick as a thought. The hail melted where it struck the burning pavement and then the sun broke through and the rain came again and with it two rainbows arced across the sky like some biblical covenant.\n\nThe houses stood quiet for a time after, till folk began to drift back from wherever they'd sheltered. Then it was like always. Women watching their young ones while dinner cooked inside. Different from New Hampshire this place was, forty minutes outside Charlotte where I'd come to rest. The southern voices soft and strange like music from another country. Two bedrooms and two baths in each unit though some were smaller inside than others which didnt make no sense but that's how it was.\n\nBehind the houses there was a pond where swimming wasnt allowed and I'd walk there sometimes seeing deer moving like ghosts through the morning mist while bullfrogs sang their ancient songs. Roosters called from the surrounding farms each dawn and sometimes in the evening a donkey would bray into the growing dark like he was telling the world he still drew breath. A good place it was. A place a body could call home.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Memory holds the move from Riverdale to Stockbridge like a photograph faded at the edges. Tears came then, for what was lost and what was loved, though mama and daddy had their reasons. Better schools they said. Better houses. Places where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nTime passed like water through fingers. Made friends and enemies both, though neighbors remained strangers save for Mr. Glen and Dennis living adjacent. Good folk. Like blood almost. Remember Mr. Glen's wedding clear as yesterday, him taking another wife. Caught the white garter when Ms. Veda sent it sailing through the lamplight. Danced with Marsharii that night, her face young and full of promise. Never saw her after. World swallows some whole.\n\nThe streets here wind like snakes in summer grass. GPS helps now but before it was just wandering. Me and Kason and Curtis, we'd lose ourselves in video games, in the simple pleasure of being young and alive. Sometimes I'd walk alone to the park where the trees stand sentinel. Brought sticks from the hardware store to practice balance, brought the wooden sword too. Something holy in that solitude.\n\nCourts there for basketball and tennis both, empty now but waiting. Daddy and Mr. Graves taught us tennis years back, worked us till our muscles burned and our hearts sang. Good times those were. Simple times.\n\nReckon there's more stories buried in these streets than I could tell in a day. But these are the ones that stick like burrs to the soul, that won't shake loose no matter how far you walk. And somewhere ahead the future waits, patient as stone, holding whatever comes next in its dark hands.",
            "Johnston lay there in the South Carolina heat like some forgotten outpost of civilization. A town that breathed peaches. The welcome sign proclaimed it proud, Peach Capital of the World, though the world had long since moved on from such declarations. Fields stretched out beyond sight, peach trees standing sentinel over the cattle that grazed in the spaces between. Houses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming under the merciless sun or gray shingles dulled by time and weather, each dwelling an island in the agricultural sea.\n\nThe town center nothing more than a single stoplight swaying in the wind at a fourway crossing, watching over the few establishments that clung to existence there. Hong Kong, run by a family whose story was never told. Fiesta Mexican. Gary's with its burgers. The pizzeria long gone now, its windows dark and empty like dead eyes. Maxwell and Halford Drug still poured cherry cola like some remnant of an older time. IGA stood charging prices that drove folk twenty miles to Batesburg-Leesville where the Walmart waited like some retail paradise.\n\nDollar General remained the heart of it all, its fluorescent pulse drawing people from sunup to sundown. Possibilities Furniture & More occupied its corner, the owner's kindness a currency more valuable than money, her two movers like disciples of her trade. Next door the pet groomer tended to the town's companions, washing and clipping away the dust of rural life.\n\nThe doctor and the vet practiced their arts in quiet buildings away from the center, treating the living things of Johnston with what tools they had. The elementary school stood alone, releasing its children to other towns once they grew too old for its walls. They were building a park now, two and a half acres of hope for a future that might never come.\n\nNo theaters here. No bowling alleys. No places for youth to gather and dream of escape. Just the road through town, quick enough to miss in a blink, like a dream you cant quite remember come morning. The town endured, neither dying nor truly living, suspended in the humid air like a peach not yet ready to fall.",
            "The street runs between two highways like a vein between arteries, carrying the lifeblood of traffic past our house that stands sentinel at the corner where the pavement bends. Tennessee. Small town. The kind of place where folk dont come and go much anymore, like the world done forgot about it somehow. We watch them all from here, me and the wife and the two girls, eleven and fourteen, watching through windows like pale ghosts in a house that's become our world entire.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out before us like some dying thing, houses scattered among trees that was here long before any of us. Folk go about their business like they always have. Mowing grass till the machines sound like theyre calling to one another across the yards, March through October when the grass finally yields to the coming cold. Then the leaves begin their death march, drifting down in browns and reds till they carpet the ground and we burn them, the smoke rising up like prayers in the autumn air.\n\nWinter ain't what it used to be. More like autumn that won't die, hanging on past its time. The children still find their way down the hill on sleds when the snow comes, which ain't often anymore. Most days its just bikes and dogs and walkers moving through the street like specters in some half-remembered dream.\n\nThe garage stands at the back of the house where I work on my truck, doors open to the world like wounds. Front door might as well be sealed shut for all we use it. Holidays bring the strangers, cars lined up and down the street like mourners at a wake. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and they go and the street returns to its silence.\n\nSometimes we cook out back, smoke rising from the grill like signals to whoever might be watching. Sometimes we play in the rain, the water washing away whatever sins we might have gathered. But mostly we just watch. Watch the cars pass, watch the seasons change, watch the neighbors move through their lives like actors in some great theater we cant quite understand. This street, this life, this endless procession of days. It'd be perfect if it weren't for the traffic. But nothing's perfect anymore. Maybe it never was.",
            "The land stretches out brown and dead, nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. Dirt and more dirt still. Nobody knows what it means less they lived here, less they woke each morning to that vast brown emptiness, the rare patch of green lawn standing like some rich man's mockery of nature itself. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart, scattered like bones across the waste. Still do mostly, though new structures rise up now, civilization creeping in slow but steady like some horrid tide.\n\nPlace grows more citified with each passing season though that's the way of things everywhere now. Folk here are kindly enough but like anywhere there's good and there's bad and there's worse. My patch is ringed with old folk, friendly enough, marking this as one of the better places though that don't mean much. The stores are all them chain operations. Food For Less. Smart and Final. Nothing fancy. You want that kind of thing you got to travel and even then.\n\nConstruction work's what keeps most alive out here. Not from reading no statistics but from watching. Makes sense with all this empty space waiting to be filled. That thought sits in my gut like a stone. Left the big city to get away from all that. Now I work construction myself, hanging drywall and ceiling bars, watching the spread of it.\n\nBut it's the animals make this place what it is. Folk come here for different reasons but mainly it's the stark beauty of it, the challenge of it. Desert's got its own rules, its own way of being. Got creatures living here can't live nowhere else. Human folk best learn to live alongside em proper. My young ones took to it natural. Even now they're out there hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen, learning the ways of this hard land.\n\nTown's got its attractions if you want em. County fair comes through regular. Folks head up to Wrightwood when they need to see snow, learn to slide down mountains for sport. Museum's got old bones and Indian things, tells how this place came to be what it is. But that ain't what matters. What matters is the desert itself, vast and empty, waiting patient as stone while we scurry bout building our little lives atop it, temporary as morning dew.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete labyrinth. Gray and godless. He reckons it his neighborhood though he knows such words mean little now. Not like the neighborhoods of old where families dwelt in their separate houses and children played in streets now long dead and gone.\n\nThe buildings rise up like ancient monoliths. Three kinds there are. The apartments first, stacked two stories high with their identical windows staring out blind and dark. Twenty souls perhaps in each one, though he cannot be sure. Then the houses proper, scattered few and far between, where the old guard dwells. Alumni they're called, though such words mean little now. And last the dormitories, great concrete hives where hundreds sleep two by two in cells no bigger than prison holds.\n\nThe people here are of all kinds and colors, though that matters little now. The elders keep to their houses while the young ones crowd the dorms and the ones between take the apartments. Like some great sorting of souls, each to their designated place in this concrete purgatory.\n\nThere are stores too, though they ain't like the stores of old. Places to eat and places to buy clothes marked with symbols of learning. A single park remains, kept clean by some unspoken covenant among those who dwell here. At night it lies empty and dark, the swings creaking soft in the wind like hanging men.\n\nHe studies it all through eyes grown tired of looking. This is his neighborhood now, this place of learning and waiting. Self-contained and sealed off from the world beyond like some great ark adrift on a sea of asphalt and concrete. He knows no other home now. Knows too that home is just a word, like neighborhood, like community. Words that mean less with each passing day.\n\nBut still they persist here, all of them, in their concrete caves and their borrowed beds. Still they wake each morning and go about their rituals of learning, as if such things still matter in a world grown strange and cold. Perhaps they do. Perhaps this is all that's left to them now. This place. These people. This neighborhood that ain't really a neighborhood at all.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward from where the house stands like some ancient sentinel at the peak of what they call the workout hill, though there aint nothing about exercise in its nature. Just gravity and the weight of things. Folk walk in the road cause there aint no choice about it. The pavement's broke and scarred like an old fighter's face, pocked with holes that'll tear the heart out of any vehicle daring enough to pass. Above it all hang the wires, patched and mended like a vagrant's coat, victims of countless storms that rake through here regular as grief. The repairmen come and go and the wires get uglier.\n\nTrees rise up everywhere. Tall evergreens that folk hate cause they block the view of the water. They cut em down with a vengeance born of greed, building their glass houses higher and higher, reaching up like drowning men for a glimpse of the bay. At sunset the water burns like molten copper but mostly its hidden behind clouds thick as wool blankets, the light filtering through like some weak memory of brightness. The damp claims everything here. Moss creeps across the world like a plague, turning roofs and cars and metal to green fur. Left my own vehicle out once and nature took it back, took three hours of scraping to reclaim it from the green.\n\nAint many children. Just old folk waiting out their days, and dogs. Dogs everywhere, running wild and free, sneaking into houses like thieves through any door left open by the careless. Found one in my living room once, staring at me like I was the intruder. The rabbits too, big as cats some of them, tearing up gardens till my cats hunted em down. Birds pass through - sparrows, hummingbirds small as thoughts, and sometimes a hawk floating overhead till the crows drive it off like some dark army protecting their territory.\n\nDown by the water there's places to eat what the bay provides, though there aint much beach to speak of. Just rocks for throwing into the gray water. The opposite shore sits out there in the mist like some dream of civilization, close enough to see but too far to touch. Just watching and waiting while the fog rolls in.",
            "They say Bensonhurst aint hard to find. The trains come and go like metal serpents through the concrete canyons of Brooklyn, carrying souls worn thin by the city's weight. The streets lay dark and solemn beneath perpetual sheets of gray sky.\n\nThe neighborhood bears its own particular darkness. Not the darkness of empty places but the darkness of too many souls pressed together in weathered buildings that stand like tired sentinels. Asian letters flash their neon promises from every storefront, marking territory claimed over decades past. Supermarkets and laundromats line the streets like prayer beads on a rosary, each one identical to the last, each one necessary as breath.\n\nWhere I stand now there are four markets within sight of each other, their windows fogged with steam and voices speaking in tongues I do not know. The people here are pilgrims all, first and second sons of immigrants seeking something they cannot name. The businesses belong mostly to the Asians now, their industry as relentless as the tide.\n\nThey built a park nearby. Ten courts for basketball where children play their endless games. Soccer fields stretch out like dead grass seas. Handball courts stand silent as tombs until filled with the echo of rubber balls and young voices. A fountain spits water in summer months, blessing the children with temporary baptism.\n\nThe buildings here are low and humble. No glass towers reach for God. Just homes stacked two deep where families weather the long nights. Music bleeds from passing cars like wounds, engines roar their defiance at the dawn. Nights bring their own particular terrors. The streets grow teeth. Men with hollow eyes seek prey among the shadows.\n\nI knew their violence once. Felt fists against flesh, learned the taste of blood and fear. Now thieves hunt packages left on stoops like carrion birds. And everywhere the dogs leave their offerings, ignored by masters who have forgotten the meaning of civilization. The city fines mean nothing here where law is just a whisper carried away by wind.\n\nWatch your step in Bensonhurst. The concrete remembers everything it has seen.",
            "You got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon fore you can understand the place itself. Written up on some building that serves pizza and liquor and flesh and music and probably breaks half dozen laws doing it are the words Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say its bout remembering the old days when the city wasnt so known and wasnt so dear and folk could make something different of themselves here. Others hear it like a calling. Come to Portland theyd say. We'll call you weird here too but we'll mean it kind.\n\nThe Californians came with their money and their condos rose like concrete weeds from the earth but Portland stayed weird all the same. Not that weird means kind exactly. More like accepting things others wont accept. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere else in this godforsaken country. Weird aint about that.\n\nIn my part of town the houses stand painted in colors that'd make a carnival jealous. Gardens growing wild with herbs and flowers pressing up through cracks in the sidewalk like nature trying to take back whats hers. And there's them free boxes. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic. Like offerings to whatever gods still care to look down on us. Books and clothes mostly but could be anything. Something bout walking these streets in Southeast makes you believe in magic again. Least thats how I see it but Im just one kind of weird in this city of thousands.\n\nSome folk wouldnt touch nothing from a sidewalk box. They do their yoga with goats. Yes real goats. Or they go watch them Timbers kick a ball round a field. Portland's got all kinds. Dreamers and drunks and them that cant tell the difference no more.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray and constant like God crying. Brings the darkness in peoples minds. We got drugs here sure. Got homeless too. More than most places cause we try to help em but we dont help enough. Never enough. The rest of us we care bout em or we hate em depending on the day. In that we aint weird at all. Just human. Poor sorry humans same as anywhere else.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel. Always there in the north, bearing witness to the coming and going of light like some ancient gods carved from stone. A man might forget them in the daily toil of existence but they remain, unmoved and unchanging, like thoughts in the mind of God. When the weight of living becomes too much they call out with their silence and a man might look upon them and find some measure of peace in their permanence.\n\nI came here first as a young man. The university stretched out below them peaks like some congregation before an altar. Fine buildings there were and pools of water reflecting the sky and trees that had stood longer than any man's memory but it was them mountains that held dominion over all. The town beneath grew like weeds in the shadow of stone. Coffee houses with their bitter smell where young folk bent over books in the small hours. The downtown with its old brick worn smooth by time and weather, buildings pressed together like folk huddled against the cold. For them few blocks it was like some greater city had sprouted up out of the quiet earth but that feeling passed quick as it came once you walked past the library.\n\nMemories collect in such places like water in a basin. Some sweet and some bitter. Walking with friends past playground swings gone to rust in the darkness after studying all night. Running through crowded streets to catch some picture show in that fancy theater. But there were darker times too. Sitting by them ponds at two in the morning watching ducks and turtles going about their business while inside your head the darkness grows. Watching them creatures each with their purpose while your own seems lost in the vastness of living.\n\nSo I walked. Past the pond and the park and them little houses all lined up neat like graves. When I reached the main road the sun was coming up, painting everything in fire and shadow. Palm trees stood like sentries and above it all them mountains remained. Cutting into that fire-touched sky like they had done since before man walked upright. And something in that permanence spoke without speaking. Some truth older than words about carrying on. About enduring.",
            "You wouldnt see it at first passing. Just retail facades and empty lots where folk once shopped for organic produce and whatnot. But beyond the dead Whole Foods and past them hotels that only breathe life when summer brings the reunions of blood kin, there's a whole world moving and breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like great concrete monoliths laid out in perfect succession, each one watching the other in some kind of architectural vigil. First ones got darkness in their history. Best leave them be. Truth aint always what papers tell.\n\nBeyond these stands another world. Silent. Unknown to most. College buildings squatting low against the earth, students dragging themselves through iron gates that screech like dying things in the dawn light. Traffic backed up while morning folk curse from their vehicles, their words lost in the heavy air.\n\nRoad ends at a T, park on one side and them bone-mending folks on the other. Their porch with its wicker chairs and that ceiling fan turning slow circles in air thick as molasses. Children spinning themselves through the grass like gyroscopes while bees work the flowers growing wild by the roadside. Old ones walking their dogs, eyeing the young ones on their boards with suspicion born of years. Girls gather like birds on playground metal, speaking secrets about boys and whatever moving pictures light up their phones these days.\n\nStrip mall stands sentinel. Sushi joint never full but keeping on somehow. Swimming store. Nail place. All of it lined up neat like artifacts in some museum of modern living. Frozen yogurt spot drawing them young ones like moths, their cups sweating in the heat while they show off on wheels and breathe sweet smoke into the heavy air, thinking themselves immortal.\n\nThis here's a piece of the old south. Time moves different here. Like molasses in winter. Everything preserved in amber, waiting. Just waiting.",
            "The houses stood like ancient sentinels. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still in their weathered communion. Small yards stretched before them and narrow drives lay alongside like pale wounds in the earth. They spoke of times past when suburban living was the dream that held this country in its grip but that dream was loosening now like a rope worn thin by time and weather. Yet these neighborhoods persisted. Called out their testament to any who'd listen that the dream hadnt died entirely.\n\nThe people walked different now. Less hope in their step. Yards gone wild where once they'd been kept pristine but still the cars sat in drives two by two like creatures waiting for the flood. Children played in the streets as if the world ended at its borders. The school stood ninety years strong conjuring futures in the young while stirring ghosts in the old. Churches sparse and empty but the basketball courts filled with life and motion. Houses different as thumbprints but kindred somehow in their bones.\n\nSuper A they called it. Run by Yemenis, perhaps the only Arab folk for miles in this sea of black faces. Streets wide as rivers where children played their games, scattering like starlings when cars approached. Folk here could trace their blood back generations in this place. Tell tales of when neighbor knew neighbor like kin.\n\nWhere once stood a karate school now stood a pharmacy. Dreams of martial glory faded with the moving pictures that spawned them. Pills took their place. The old theatre still showed its ancient reels, saved from crowds by young folk's scorn but blessed by the elders who found comfort in its dimness, away from children's eyes.\n\nA single highway passed through but never touched ground here. Young ones wanted an exit built but the elders knew better. Knew that progress was just another word for death. They were building a new school now. Talking of mascots. Some spoke of a mechanical man with a country drawl and a cabin of logs. But in this place nothing was ever truly new. Just old things wearing different faces.",
            "The city sprawls vast and merciless before him. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a gray sky that holds neither promise nor redemption. Streets wind through the maze of steel and glass, some bearing names in foreign tongues - Koreatown, Little Armenia - each a world sealed within itself. Traffic moves like blood through clogged arteries, two hours to traverse ten miles, the vehicles packed together in mindless congregation.\n\nHe studies the neighborhood from his window. Orthodox Jews in black coats moving like shadows through the morning light. Soviet refugees carrying their histories like wounds that won't heal. Rainbow flags hanging limp in windows, testaments to loves that dare speak their names. All of them moving through the same dead space, breathing the same tired air.\n\nThe parks stand like green islands in the concrete sea. Children play there still, their voices carrying across time itself, reminiscent of days when he too ran wild with the neighbor boy, before the world grew cold and strange. Now neighbors pass like ghosts, nameless, faceless, sealed behind walls and doors that never open.\n\nConstruction cranes loom against the horizon like ancient siege machines. New towers rising, steel bones reaching skyward, while below the streets grow more congested, more choked with each passing season. Parking spaces become rare as gold. The city devours itself and grows hungry still.\n\nHouses crouch between the towers - single homes, duplexes, small apartment blocks - each one a universe unto itself. Some dating back to times when people still knew their neighbors' names, when communities weren't just words in real estate listings. But those days are gone now, gone like smoke in the wind, like all things must go.\n\nThe streets fill and empty, fill and empty, an endless tide of humanity washing through the concrete canyons. Each soul carrying its own story, its own burden, moving through the vastness alone. The city holds them all, indifferent as God, while the sun wheels overhead in a sky the color of beaten lead.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn. This is it, I told her. She'd never known such emptiness, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The corn stretched out beyond sight, row upon row like soldiers in formation, waiting. I told her bout growing up here in Ohio country, watching recognition dawn in her eyes like the slow light of morning.\n\nPast the water-filled quarry the houses rose up from the earth, brick and stucco set back from the road on half-acre plots tended like holy ground. Spring brought forth flowers planted by hands that knew the seasons, knew the trees that died and lived again with each turn of the year. Mercedes machines gleamed in driveways like chrome beasts drinking the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived three houses down, always outside, always singing above his mower's drone. Doctor once, they said. Now just a man who'd lost pieces of himself to time, melding with the grass and his green John Deere like some strange hybrid creature born of lawn and machine.\n\nOur house stood grey against grey sky. Geese claimed the side yard til the terrier drove them off. Behind lay the stream that fed the quarry, carrying bullfrog song and cattle lowing from distant pastures. Cross the wooden bridge we built with our hands and you'd find yourself in untamed country. Wild flowers and herbs grew there among trees that knew no master.\n\nThis was where childhood lived. Where we built fortresses in trees and stalked imaginary prey. Where neighborhood children appeared like spirits through the brush, companions in our wild games.\n\nWinter came hard and merciless but brought its own terrible beauty. The yard transformed from living green to dead white wilderness. Trees that once bloomed pink and purple stood naked now, their dark bones reaching toward leaden sky. Snow came in the night like judgment, covering all. My sister's angels lay scattered in drifts while snowmen stood sentinel. We warred with packed ice, building frozen ramparts to shield our arsenal of winter weapons. Here in our sealed white world we played at life while real life waited somewhere beyond the fields, beyond the corn, beyond our knowing. We were children then. We knew nothing of what waited."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This land aint got no gleaming towers nor the bright lights of commerce that other folk speak of. Just farmland stretching out like a tired blanket til it meets them tourist towns. No malls here. No Walmarts. No chain restaurants with their neon signs blazing against the night sky. Everything you need is a drive away through the empty country.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold something ancient and true. Two lakes lap at the edges of our town like giant mirrors laid flat against the earth. Lake Michigan to one side vast and cold, Lake Charlevoix to the other. Everywhere you turn theres sand waiting for bare feet, water waiting to swallow your reflection.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old soldiers who've seen too much. Aint no matching faces here. Each one tells its own story. Some got fresh paint and new windows, others wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see from the road, dug deep into the Michigan clay. Aluminum siding gone gray with time covers most, colors faded like old photographs left in the sun.\n\nChildren run wild in the streets like scattered birds. Dogs tug at their leashes. Bikes leave thin trails in the dust. Folk here know each other. Know who belongs and who dont. They wave from their grills, smoke rising up like prayers. They nod as they pass, dogs padding alongside.\n\nThe yards stay trim, grass cut low like a military haircut. No dead leaves allowed to gather and rot. Plants stand in neat rows like prisoners. Its not beautiful in the way that makes people stop and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes them want to stay. Safe. Quiet. Like the world before it went wrong.\n\nThe jail squats at the edge of town, gray and watchful. The health department beside it like some kind of promise. Planes drone overhead from the small airport, their shadows crossing yards where baseball games echo from nearby fields. The recycling center hums its own quiet song of preservation.\n\nIce cream can be had by foot, and downtown aint far if youre of a mind to walk it. Children pedal their bikes to the park like pilgrims to a shrine, eight blocks through the heart of what we call home. This here's a place where the world still makes sense. Where people can still find their way back to what matters. A place where the day ends soft and quiet, like a prayer whispered in the dark.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in the dead heat of morning. Row upon row of them identical and stark against the pallid sky. No variation in their countenance save what the homeowners association would permit in their godlike governance of such things. Small patches of grass lay before each dwelling trimmed and manicured like cemetery plots. Gravel beds with their decorative stones bleached white in the sun. The driveways short and perfect leading to garages that could shelter two vehicles and nothing more.\n\nThey'd paved these roads not long past. Fresh concrete unmarred by time or neglect stretched out before you like a river of bone. No potholes here. No imperfection that might speak to the passage of years or the weight of vehicles gone before. Some dwellings rose two stories tall but most crouched low against the earth as if wary of drawing attention to themselves.\n\nThe mailboxes stood gathered at the street's end like prisoners awaiting judgment. Not separate markers for each home as you might expect but a congregation of metal boxes bound together, each secured by its own key. Two larger chambers for parcels that might come. The association had ordained it thus and so it remained.\n\nAt the city's edge where suburban order gave way to rural chaos the neighborhood sprawled vast and purposeful. Swimming pools lay behind iron gates available to any who lived here and could prove their belonging. Walking paths wound through the emptiness like the tracks of ancient creatures long extinct. You could walk your dog there or take evening constitutional without need of designated parkland. The retired folk who made up most of the population would watch from their windows, guardians of this manufactured peace. Young professionals moved among them like ghosts, outnumbered but tolerated.\n\nThe city itself lay fifteen minutes distant by automobile, a sprawling thing that somehow maintained its small-town pretense. One mall stood there, neither grand nor humble but sufficient to its purpose. Markets of various persuasion lined the streets from the organic temples of the wealthy to the bare-bones outlets where the poor sought sustenance.\n\nThis was a place of safety and order. A place where man had imposed his will upon the landscape and called it good. The swimming pools gleamed like blind eyes in the sun. The walking trails wound their way through carefully managed wilderness. And all of it lay just far enough from commerce to maintain its isolation while remaining within reach of every chain store and market that modern life demanded. This was civilization's compromise with chaos, and it endured.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished. Strange thing to hear in a city where folk paid thousands just to lay their heads. None I knew spoke of such tales. Maybe it's the weight of living crushing down. Some nights you hear the sobbing through the walls, through the floors. Folk learn to scrape by. Learn to love the smell of other people's castoffs, mothballed clothes and broken toys laid out on folding tables in the dust. The smell of youth dies quiet. Some take to smoking. Some just forget what clean air tastes like. But the flea market smell, it stays. Settles in like death. Smells like forgotten magazines yellowing on a dead piano. Gets in the leather and wont wash out no matter what you do.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking. Start at the far end, you can work your way through two charity shops, the library with its musty books, rare book dealer, curio shop with its shelves of dead men's treasures. Downtown's thick with bodies and machines, morning till night, but step inside them stores and the world goes quiet as a tomb. Good place to lose yourself. More of them coming every year, the bodies and machines. Growing city, they say. Some big company dealing in clicks and packages made its home here. Like New York in a way. Everyone got their own heading, don't nobody ask much of you. Can keep to yourself, quiet-like, independent. Not like down South where caring means prying. Here you can keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like waves on a dead shore.\n\nLife still moves though. Got a piano player next door, couple singers upstairs always working their scales. Less strangers sharing walls than a kind of family. Come together when needs must. Share the birthdays, the funerals, the hard times. Lucky in a way. Most of them treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. Trade favors like mail delivery. See them smile when I pass and think maybe they're glad of me like I'm glad of them. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but it's them makes me think I ain't totally lost my way after all.",
            "The town lies just beyond where the city's reach ends. A small place. Midwestern. We live on the east side where the poorest folk dwell in homes worth little more than kindling. Rental signs stand like sentries on grassless yards. But there aint no ugliness here like you might expect. Folk still nod and speak when you pass. They remember such things.\n\nViolence visits sometimes like an unwelcome relative that wont leave. Gunshots in the night. Blood on sidewalks. The neighbors boy got killed outside some bar last year. His mother still sits on that porch watching nothing. We lost a few things left outside but nothing more. The real killer here is that white powder. Fentanyl. It takes them quick and quiet. Town's got places for them that want help. Teaching folks how to bring the dead back with that Narcan. Some make it. Most dont.\n\nThe boy goes to school where they treat him right despite his differences. Good people there. Teachers that still care about such things. Parents meeting regular to plan things for the children. More than twenty of every hundred here cant feed their own so the school feeds em all. Breakfast and lunch. No child marked for being poor.\n\nThe council men build their gardens and fix their roads but mostly in the middle of town or the west side where the money lives. East side gets forgotten like an old dog under the porch. But we been here sixteen years in this little house that aint worth much but keeps the rain out. Stores enough to get by. Good people mostly. Cant imagine being nowhere else though sometimes at night I hear them shots and wonder if the devil aint living here too somewhere in them shadows.",
            "The neighborhood rises like some ancient beast from the belly of the city, its spine a ridge of weathered buildings crowned with histories dark and deep. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater stands sentinel, its marquee dead and silent now like the eyes of something long buried. Down the slope there's a place where folk gather when the nights turn warm, an arcade bar they call it, though it bears little resemblance to the penny arcades of old. They queue there in the summer months, June and July mostly, standing patient and solemn like mourners at some perpetual wake.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast and empty save for the concrete that rings it like a collar, steps carved into its throat like the marks of some ancient ceremony. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents arrayed in rows precise as headstones. Rain comes more often than snow, beating against canvas like nature's own dirge. They huddle close, these wanderers, seeking warmth in numbers, closer to the heart of things than out there in what they call the jungle. The family center stands like a beacon, offering water and soap and brief moments of dignity.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks to me, nor them proud old buildings that march down toward the sea. It's the people carrying their histories like scripture. Hilltop, they say, was once mean as a rattler, gang violence flowing through its streets like poison. Federal men came through with their badges and guns, sweeping clean what couldn't be cleaned. The stories persist, passed down like dark gospels, mother to child, stranger to stranger.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens, though outsiders still speak of danger. White folk, they say, best clear out after dark. But that's just echoes, old fears speaking with dead tongues. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass, or maybe Hilltop knows its own - them that understand how fear and ignorance breed like rats in the walls of this supposed melting pot paradise.\n\nThis is home now. These streets know me like I know them. Strangers offer warmth more often than harm. The laundry woman keeps her lights burning when the rain comes horizontal and mean. I've sat against cold concrete, thinking myself invisible as ash, only to have some passerby reach down with a five-dollar bill and words sweet as scripture: you're beautiful, they say, you're valuable. And in this place, in this moment, it rings true as gospel.",
            "They came to this place when he was thirteen summers old, before the boy had learned the ways of men. The houses stood like sentinels, two stories tall and identical in their suburban uniformity, stretched out along the asphalt road that wound through the development like a black river. The boy had no friends then but time brought him two companions, one who lived two doors down and another who dwelt further along the street. Both gone now but their ghosts remained.\n\nThe neighborhood stood unchanged. Like some photograph yellowed with age but preserved in its essence. Children's voices carried on the warm wind whenever the sun showed itself, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. Most days the streets lay quiet. No quarrels with neighbors. No strife. A place where solitude was respected save when aid was needed. Packages left on porches remained untouched, as if protected by some unspoken covenant between the dwellers of this place.\n\nThere was a park. Not more than a hundred yards distant. A place of memories both blessed and cursed. Where basketballs had arced through summer evenings and footballs spiraled against gray autumn skies. Where blood had flowed from the boy's nose one cold afternoon, crimson drops staining white winter ground. Now he brought his cousin's children there, watching them swing and slide in their innocent joy, their excitement pure and untainted by time's passing.\n\nThe streets around teemed with the foods of many nations. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All within walking distance though most now summoned their sustenance through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints squatted on corners like gargoyles, identical to those in every other suburb in this vast land. Pizza parlors too, their red signs glowing in the dusk.\n\nStores lined the streets like trading posts of old. Dry cleaners. Drug stores facing each other across the road like duelists. A grocery store bearing a name known only to those who dwelled in these northern territories. And there was the Indian store, its shelves stocked with spices and strange grains, preserved foods in jars like specimens in some exotic museum.\n\nHe thought of other neighborhoods he'd read about. Places where darkness dwelt in men's hearts and evil walked abroad in daylight. This place was not like those. Here was peace of a sort. Here was home.",
            "The college stands near where I live, a blessing of sorts in this godless stretch of urban decay. Apartment buildings rise like ancient monoliths against a gray sky, their facades weathered and worn by time's merciless march. Between them stand the bars and eateries where the young gather, counting their meager coins for watered-down spirits. One such establishment recently took on a new name, as if christening could wash away its sins of overpriced libations and indifferent service.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes: the students, temporary as morning frost, and the poor souls anchored by poverty to these crumbling walls. Children too, their voices carrying across concrete and asphalt from the schoolyard nearby. My neighbors remain strangers by choice, though their marijuana smoke seeps through walls like some spectral presence. Management's solution: a plastic box spewing artificial freshness, a joke told in the language of corporate impotence.\n\nDown the road stand new buildings, false promises wrapped in cheap materials and high rent. Their walls thin as playing cards, built by men who knew nothing of permanence. A restaurant serves microwaved sustenance on paper plates, a temple to disposable living. Beside it squats a gas station, where desperate men trade hours of their lives for dollars.\n\nThe city, in its infinite wisdom, laid new concrete paths and planted grass in strips, as if nature could be parceled and contained. My building hunkers beneath ancient trees, some now reduced to stumps like broken teeth in a dying mouth. Behind us lies 43rd Street, a darker reflection of our own, where cracked sidewalks spider-web beneath feet and buildings wear their shame openly. Crime blooms there like black mold, though it seeps across boundaries, respecting no borders we devise.\n\nYet I remain, tethered by economics and convenience to this place. The university stands within walking distance, and buses carry the carless to their destinations like modern-day ferrymen. This is my station now, among the concrete and the dying trees, in this purgatory between poverty and promise.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, their white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They'd built them to look separate but they wasnt. Folk gathered most evenings at the end of whatever drive suited them, speaking soft words while their young ones made chalk marks on the concrete or sent their kites up into that vast blue nothing. Like some forgotten time it was. A place where the mechanical world hadnt yet laid its cold hand.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up black against the sky where clouds moved like great white ships. But the weather it had turned. Last night the sirens came wailing through the darkness and we knew what was coming. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever treasures I thought to save while the big one paced the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles hitting the earth. When it was done the road steamed like some creature breathing its last and the temperature had dropped from ninety-two to seventy-five quick as a thought. The hail melted where it struck the burning pavement and then the sun broke through and the rain came again and with it two rainbows arced across the sky like some biblical covenant.\n\nThe houses stood quiet for a time after, till folk began to drift back from wherever they'd sheltered. Then it was like always. Women watching their young ones while dinner cooked inside. Different from New Hampshire this place was, forty minutes outside Charlotte where I'd come to rest. The southern voices soft and strange like music from another country. Two bedrooms and two baths in each unit though some were smaller inside than others which didnt make no sense but that's how it was.\n\nBehind the houses there was a pond where swimming wasnt allowed and I'd walk there sometimes seeing deer moving like ghosts through the morning mist while bullfrogs sang their ancient songs. Roosters called from the surrounding farms each dawn and sometimes in the evening a donkey would bray into the growing dark like he was telling the world he still drew breath. A good place it was. A place a body could call home.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Memory holds the move from Riverdale to Stockbridge like a photograph faded at the edges. Tears came then, for what was lost and what was loved, though mama and daddy had their reasons. Better schools they said. Better houses. Places where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nTime passed like water through fingers. Made friends and enemies both, though neighbors remained strangers save for Mr. Glen and Dennis living adjacent. Good folk. Like blood almost. Remember Mr. Glen's wedding clear as yesterday, him taking another wife. Caught the white garter when Ms. Veda sent it sailing through the lamplight. Danced with Marsharii that night, her face young and full of promise. Never saw her after. World swallows some whole.\n\nThe streets here wind like snakes in summer grass. GPS helps now but before it was just wandering. Me and Kason and Curtis, we'd lose ourselves in video games, in the simple pleasure of being young and alive. Sometimes I'd walk alone to the park where the trees stand sentinel. Brought sticks from the hardware store to practice balance, brought the wooden sword too. Something holy in that solitude.\n\nCourts there for basketball and tennis both, empty now but waiting. Daddy and Mr. Graves taught us tennis years back, worked us till our muscles burned and our hearts sang. Good times those were. Simple times.\n\nReckon there's more stories buried in these streets than I could tell in a day. But these are the ones that stick like burrs to the soul, that won't shake loose no matter how far you walk. And somewhere ahead the future waits, patient as stone, holding whatever comes next in its dark hands.",
            "Johnston lay there in the South Carolina heat like some forgotten outpost of civilization. A town that breathed peaches. The welcome sign proclaimed it proud, Peach Capital of the World, though the world had long since moved on from such declarations. Fields stretched out beyond sight, peach trees standing sentinel over the cattle that grazed in the spaces between. Houses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming under the merciless sun or gray shingles dulled by time and weather, each dwelling an island in the agricultural sea.\n\nThe town center nothing more than a single stoplight swaying in the wind at a fourway crossing, watching over the few establishments that clung to existence there. Hong Kong, run by a family whose story was never told. Fiesta Mexican. Gary's with its burgers. The pizzeria long gone now, its windows dark and empty like dead eyes. Maxwell and Halford Drug still poured cherry cola like some remnant of an older time. IGA stood charging prices that drove folk twenty miles to Batesburg-Leesville where the Walmart waited like some retail paradise.\n\nDollar General remained the heart of it all, its fluorescent pulse drawing people from sunup to sundown. Possibilities Furniture & More occupied its corner, the owner's kindness a currency more valuable than money, her two movers like disciples of her trade. Next door the pet groomer tended to the town's companions, washing and clipping away the dust of rural life.\n\nThe doctor and the vet practiced their arts in quiet buildings away from the center, treating the living things of Johnston with what tools they had. The elementary school stood alone, releasing its children to other towns once they grew too old for its walls. They were building a park now, two and a half acres of hope for a future that might never come.\n\nNo theaters here. No bowling alleys. No places for youth to gather and dream of escape. Just the road through town, quick enough to miss in a blink, like a dream you cant quite remember come morning. The town endured, neither dying nor truly living, suspended in the humid air like a peach not yet ready to fall.",
            "The street runs between two highways like a vein between arteries, carrying the lifeblood of traffic past our house that stands sentinel at the corner where the pavement bends. Tennessee. Small town. The kind of place where folk dont come and go much anymore, like the world done forgot about it somehow. We watch them all from here, me and the wife and the two girls, eleven and fourteen, watching through windows like pale ghosts in a house that's become our world entire.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out before us like some dying thing, houses scattered among trees that was here long before any of us. Folk go about their business like they always have. Mowing grass till the machines sound like theyre calling to one another across the yards, March through October when the grass finally yields to the coming cold. Then the leaves begin their death march, drifting down in browns and reds till they carpet the ground and we burn them, the smoke rising up like prayers in the autumn air.\n\nWinter ain't what it used to be. More like autumn that won't die, hanging on past its time. The children still find their way down the hill on sleds when the snow comes, which ain't often anymore. Most days its just bikes and dogs and walkers moving through the street like specters in some half-remembered dream.\n\nThe garage stands at the back of the house where I work on my truck, doors open to the world like wounds. Front door might as well be sealed shut for all we use it. Holidays bring the strangers, cars lined up and down the street like mourners at a wake. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and they go and the street returns to its silence.\n\nSometimes we cook out back, smoke rising from the grill like signals to whoever might be watching. Sometimes we play in the rain, the water washing away whatever sins we might have gathered. But mostly we just watch. Watch the cars pass, watch the seasons change, watch the neighbors move through their lives like actors in some great theater we cant quite understand. This street, this life, this endless procession of days. It'd be perfect if it weren't for the traffic. But nothing's perfect anymore. Maybe it never was.",
            "The land stretches out brown and dead, nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. Dirt and more dirt still. Nobody knows what it means less they lived here, less they woke each morning to that vast brown emptiness, the rare patch of green lawn standing like some rich man's mockery of nature itself. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart, scattered like bones across the waste. Still do mostly, though new structures rise up now, civilization creeping in slow but steady like some horrid tide.\n\nPlace grows more citified with each passing season though that's the way of things everywhere now. Folk here are kindly enough but like anywhere there's good and there's bad and there's worse. My patch is ringed with old folk, friendly enough, marking this as one of the better places though that don't mean much. The stores are all them chain operations. Food For Less. Smart and Final. Nothing fancy. You want that kind of thing you got to travel and even then.\n\nConstruction work's what keeps most alive out here. Not from reading no statistics but from watching. Makes sense with all this empty space waiting to be filled. That thought sits in my gut like a stone. Left the big city to get away from all that. Now I work construction myself, hanging drywall and ceiling bars, watching the spread of it.\n\nBut it's the animals make this place what it is. Folk come here for different reasons but mainly it's the stark beauty of it, the challenge of it. Desert's got its own rules, its own way of being. Got creatures living here can't live nowhere else. Human folk best learn to live alongside em proper. My young ones took to it natural. Even now they're out there hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen, learning the ways of this hard land.\n\nTown's got its attractions if you want em. County fair comes through regular. Folks head up to Wrightwood when they need to see snow, learn to slide down mountains for sport. Museum's got old bones and Indian things, tells how this place came to be what it is. But that ain't what matters. What matters is the desert itself, vast and empty, waiting patient as stone while we scurry bout building our little lives atop it, temporary as morning dew.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete labyrinth. Gray and godless. He reckons it his neighborhood though he knows such words mean little now. Not like the neighborhoods of old where families dwelt in their separate houses and children played in streets now long dead and gone.\n\nThe buildings rise up like ancient monoliths. Three kinds there are. The apartments first, stacked two stories high with their identical windows staring out blind and dark. Twenty souls perhaps in each one, though he cannot be sure. Then the houses proper, scattered few and far between, where the old guard dwells. Alumni they're called, though such words mean little now. And last the dormitories, great concrete hives where hundreds sleep two by two in cells no bigger than prison holds.\n\nThe people here are of all kinds and colors, though that matters little now. The elders keep to their houses while the young ones crowd the dorms and the ones between take the apartments. Like some great sorting of souls, each to their designated place in this concrete purgatory.\n\nThere are stores too, though they ain't like the stores of old. Places to eat and places to buy clothes marked with symbols of learning. A single park remains, kept clean by some unspoken covenant among those who dwell here. At night it lies empty and dark, the swings creaking soft in the wind like hanging men.\n\nHe studies it all through eyes grown tired of looking. This is his neighborhood now, this place of learning and waiting. Self-contained and sealed off from the world beyond like some great ark adrift on a sea of asphalt and concrete. He knows no other home now. Knows too that home is just a word, like neighborhood, like community. Words that mean less with each passing day.\n\nBut still they persist here, all of them, in their concrete caves and their borrowed beds. Still they wake each morning and go about their rituals of learning, as if such things still matter in a world grown strange and cold. Perhaps they do. Perhaps this is all that's left to them now. This place. These people. This neighborhood that ain't really a neighborhood at all.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward from where the house stands like some ancient sentinel at the peak of what they call the workout hill, though there aint nothing about exercise in its nature. Just gravity and the weight of things. Folk walk in the road cause there aint no choice about it. The pavement's broke and scarred like an old fighter's face, pocked with holes that'll tear the heart out of any vehicle daring enough to pass. Above it all hang the wires, patched and mended like a vagrant's coat, victims of countless storms that rake through here regular as grief. The repairmen come and go and the wires get uglier.\n\nTrees rise up everywhere. Tall evergreens that folk hate cause they block the view of the water. They cut em down with a vengeance born of greed, building their glass houses higher and higher, reaching up like drowning men for a glimpse of the bay. At sunset the water burns like molten copper but mostly its hidden behind clouds thick as wool blankets, the light filtering through like some weak memory of brightness. The damp claims everything here. Moss creeps across the world like a plague, turning roofs and cars and metal to green fur. Left my own vehicle out once and nature took it back, took three hours of scraping to reclaim it from the green.\n\nAint many children. Just old folk waiting out their days, and dogs. Dogs everywhere, running wild and free, sneaking into houses like thieves through any door left open by the careless. Found one in my living room once, staring at me like I was the intruder. The rabbits too, big as cats some of them, tearing up gardens till my cats hunted em down. Birds pass through - sparrows, hummingbirds small as thoughts, and sometimes a hawk floating overhead till the crows drive it off like some dark army protecting their territory.\n\nDown by the water there's places to eat what the bay provides, though there aint much beach to speak of. Just rocks for throwing into the gray water. The opposite shore sits out there in the mist like some dream of civilization, close enough to see but too far to touch. Just watching and waiting while the fog rolls in.",
            "They say Bensonhurst aint hard to find. The trains come and go like metal serpents through the concrete canyons of Brooklyn, carrying souls worn thin by the city's weight. The streets lay dark and solemn beneath perpetual sheets of gray sky.\n\nThe neighborhood bears its own particular darkness. Not the darkness of empty places but the darkness of too many souls pressed together in weathered buildings that stand like tired sentinels. Asian letters flash their neon promises from every storefront, marking territory claimed over decades past. Supermarkets and laundromats line the streets like prayer beads on a rosary, each one identical to the last, each one necessary as breath.\n\nWhere I stand now there are four markets within sight of each other, their windows fogged with steam and voices speaking in tongues I do not know. The people here are pilgrims all, first and second sons of immigrants seeking something they cannot name. The businesses belong mostly to the Asians now, their industry as relentless as the tide.\n\nThey built a park nearby. Ten courts for basketball where children play their endless games. Soccer fields stretch out like dead grass seas. Handball courts stand silent as tombs until filled with the echo of rubber balls and young voices. A fountain spits water in summer months, blessing the children with temporary baptism.\n\nThe buildings here are low and humble. No glass towers reach for God. Just homes stacked two deep where families weather the long nights. Music bleeds from passing cars like wounds, engines roar their defiance at the dawn. Nights bring their own particular terrors. The streets grow teeth. Men with hollow eyes seek prey among the shadows.\n\nI knew their violence once. Felt fists against flesh, learned the taste of blood and fear. Now thieves hunt packages left on stoops like carrion birds. And everywhere the dogs leave their offerings, ignored by masters who have forgotten the meaning of civilization. The city fines mean nothing here where law is just a whisper carried away by wind.\n\nWatch your step in Bensonhurst. The concrete remembers everything it has seen.",
            "You got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon fore you can understand the place itself. Written up on some building that serves pizza and liquor and flesh and music and probably breaks half dozen laws doing it are the words Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say its bout remembering the old days when the city wasnt so known and wasnt so dear and folk could make something different of themselves here. Others hear it like a calling. Come to Portland theyd say. We'll call you weird here too but we'll mean it kind.\n\nThe Californians came with their money and their condos rose like concrete weeds from the earth but Portland stayed weird all the same. Not that weird means kind exactly. More like accepting things others wont accept. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere else in this godforsaken country. Weird aint about that.\n\nIn my part of town the houses stand painted in colors that'd make a carnival jealous. Gardens growing wild with herbs and flowers pressing up through cracks in the sidewalk like nature trying to take back whats hers. And there's them free boxes. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic. Like offerings to whatever gods still care to look down on us. Books and clothes mostly but could be anything. Something bout walking these streets in Southeast makes you believe in magic again. Least thats how I see it but Im just one kind of weird in this city of thousands.\n\nSome folk wouldnt touch nothing from a sidewalk box. They do their yoga with goats. Yes real goats. Or they go watch them Timbers kick a ball round a field. Portland's got all kinds. Dreamers and drunks and them that cant tell the difference no more.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray and constant like God crying. Brings the darkness in peoples minds. We got drugs here sure. Got homeless too. More than most places cause we try to help em but we dont help enough. Never enough. The rest of us we care bout em or we hate em depending on the day. In that we aint weird at all. Just human. Poor sorry humans same as anywhere else.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel. Always there in the north, bearing witness to the coming and going of light like some ancient gods carved from stone. A man might forget them in the daily toil of existence but they remain, unmoved and unchanging, like thoughts in the mind of God. When the weight of living becomes too much they call out with their silence and a man might look upon them and find some measure of peace in their permanence.\n\nI came here first as a young man. The university stretched out below them peaks like some congregation before an altar. Fine buildings there were and pools of water reflecting the sky and trees that had stood longer than any man's memory but it was them mountains that held dominion over all. The town beneath grew like weeds in the shadow of stone. Coffee houses with their bitter smell where young folk bent over books in the small hours. The downtown with its old brick worn smooth by time and weather, buildings pressed together like folk huddled against the cold. For them few blocks it was like some greater city had sprouted up out of the quiet earth but that feeling passed quick as it came once you walked past the library.\n\nMemories collect in such places like water in a basin. Some sweet and some bitter. Walking with friends past playground swings gone to rust in the darkness after studying all night. Running through crowded streets to catch some picture show in that fancy theater. But there were darker times too. Sitting by them ponds at two in the morning watching ducks and turtles going about their business while inside your head the darkness grows. Watching them creatures each with their purpose while your own seems lost in the vastness of living.\n\nSo I walked. Past the pond and the park and them little houses all lined up neat like graves. When I reached the main road the sun was coming up, painting everything in fire and shadow. Palm trees stood like sentries and above it all them mountains remained. Cutting into that fire-touched sky like they had done since before man walked upright. And something in that permanence spoke without speaking. Some truth older than words about carrying on. About enduring.",
            "You wouldnt see it at first passing. Just retail facades and empty lots where folk once shopped for organic produce and whatnot. But beyond the dead Whole Foods and past them hotels that only breathe life when summer brings the reunions of blood kin, there's a whole world moving and breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like great concrete monoliths laid out in perfect succession, each one watching the other in some kind of architectural vigil. First ones got darkness in their history. Best leave them be. Truth aint always what papers tell.\n\nBeyond these stands another world. Silent. Unknown to most. College buildings squatting low against the earth, students dragging themselves through iron gates that screech like dying things in the dawn light. Traffic backed up while morning folk curse from their vehicles, their words lost in the heavy air.\n\nRoad ends at a T, park on one side and them bone-mending folks on the other. Their porch with its wicker chairs and that ceiling fan turning slow circles in air thick as molasses. Children spinning themselves through the grass like gyroscopes while bees work the flowers growing wild by the roadside. Old ones walking their dogs, eyeing the young ones on their boards with suspicion born of years. Girls gather like birds on playground metal, speaking secrets about boys and whatever moving pictures light up their phones these days.\n\nStrip mall stands sentinel. Sushi joint never full but keeping on somehow. Swimming store. Nail place. All of it lined up neat like artifacts in some museum of modern living. Frozen yogurt spot drawing them young ones like moths, their cups sweating in the heat while they show off on wheels and breathe sweet smoke into the heavy air, thinking themselves immortal.\n\nThis here's a piece of the old south. Time moves different here. Like molasses in winter. Everything preserved in amber, waiting. Just waiting.",
            "The houses stood like ancient sentinels. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still in their weathered communion. Small yards stretched before them and narrow drives lay alongside like pale wounds in the earth. They spoke of times past when suburban living was the dream that held this country in its grip but that dream was loosening now like a rope worn thin by time and weather. Yet these neighborhoods persisted. Called out their testament to any who'd listen that the dream hadnt died entirely.\n\nThe people walked different now. Less hope in their step. Yards gone wild where once they'd been kept pristine but still the cars sat in drives two by two like creatures waiting for the flood. Children played in the streets as if the world ended at its borders. The school stood ninety years strong conjuring futures in the young while stirring ghosts in the old. Churches sparse and empty but the basketball courts filled with life and motion. Houses different as thumbprints but kindred somehow in their bones.\n\nSuper A they called it. Run by Yemenis, perhaps the only Arab folk for miles in this sea of black faces. Streets wide as rivers where children played their games, scattering like starlings when cars approached. Folk here could trace their blood back generations in this place. Tell tales of when neighbor knew neighbor like kin.\n\nWhere once stood a karate school now stood a pharmacy. Dreams of martial glory faded with the moving pictures that spawned them. Pills took their place. The old theatre still showed its ancient reels, saved from crowds by young folk's scorn but blessed by the elders who found comfort in its dimness, away from children's eyes.\n\nA single highway passed through but never touched ground here. Young ones wanted an exit built but the elders knew better. Knew that progress was just another word for death. They were building a new school now. Talking of mascots. Some spoke of a mechanical man with a country drawl and a cabin of logs. But in this place nothing was ever truly new. Just old things wearing different faces.",
            "The city sprawls vast and merciless before him. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a gray sky that holds neither promise nor redemption. Streets wind through the maze of steel and glass, some bearing names in foreign tongues - Koreatown, Little Armenia - each a world sealed within itself. Traffic moves like blood through clogged arteries, two hours to traverse ten miles, the vehicles packed together in mindless congregation.\n\nHe studies the neighborhood from his window. Orthodox Jews in black coats moving like shadows through the morning light. Soviet refugees carrying their histories like wounds that won't heal. Rainbow flags hanging limp in windows, testaments to loves that dare speak their names. All of them moving through the same dead space, breathing the same tired air.\n\nThe parks stand like green islands in the concrete sea. Children play there still, their voices carrying across time itself, reminiscent of days when he too ran wild with the neighbor boy, before the world grew cold and strange. Now neighbors pass like ghosts, nameless, faceless, sealed behind walls and doors that never open.\n\nConstruction cranes loom against the horizon like ancient siege machines. New towers rising, steel bones reaching skyward, while below the streets grow more congested, more choked with each passing season. Parking spaces become rare as gold. The city devours itself and grows hungry still.\n\nHouses crouch between the towers - single homes, duplexes, small apartment blocks - each one a universe unto itself. Some dating back to times when people still knew their neighbors' names, when communities weren't just words in real estate listings. But those days are gone now, gone like smoke in the wind, like all things must go.\n\nThe streets fill and empty, fill and empty, an endless tide of humanity washing through the concrete canyons. Each soul carrying its own story, its own burden, moving through the vastness alone. The city holds them all, indifferent as God, while the sun wheels overhead in a sky the color of beaten lead.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn. This is it, I told her. She'd never known such emptiness, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The corn stretched out beyond sight, row upon row like soldiers in formation, waiting. I told her bout growing up here in Ohio country, watching recognition dawn in her eyes like the slow light of morning.\n\nPast the water-filled quarry the houses rose up from the earth, brick and stucco set back from the road on half-acre plots tended like holy ground. Spring brought forth flowers planted by hands that knew the seasons, knew the trees that died and lived again with each turn of the year. Mercedes machines gleamed in driveways like chrome beasts drinking the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived three houses down, always outside, always singing above his mower's drone. Doctor once, they said. Now just a man who'd lost pieces of himself to time, melding with the grass and his green John Deere like some strange hybrid creature born of lawn and machine.\n\nOur house stood grey against grey sky. Geese claimed the side yard til the terrier drove them off. Behind lay the stream that fed the quarry, carrying bullfrog song and cattle lowing from distant pastures. Cross the wooden bridge we built with our hands and you'd find yourself in untamed country. Wild flowers and herbs grew there among trees that knew no master.\n\nThis was where childhood lived. Where we built fortresses in trees and stalked imaginary prey. Where neighborhood children appeared like spirits through the brush, companions in our wild games.\n\nWinter came hard and merciless but brought its own terrible beauty. The yard transformed from living green to dead white wilderness. Trees that once bloomed pink and purple stood naked now, their dark bones reaching toward leaden sky. Snow came in the night like judgment, covering all. My sister's angels lay scattered in drifts while snowmen stood sentinel. We warred with packed ice, building frozen ramparts to shield our arsenal of winter weapons. Here in our sealed white world we played at life while real life waited somewhere beyond the fields, beyond the corn, beyond our knowing. We were children then. We knew nothing of what waited."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This land aint got no gleaming towers nor the bright lights of commerce that other folk speak of. Just farmland stretching out like a tired blanket til it meets them tourist towns. No malls here. No Walmarts. No chain restaurants with their neon signs blazing against the night sky. Everything you need is a drive away through the empty country.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold something ancient and true. Two lakes lap at the edges of our town like giant mirrors laid flat against the earth. Lake Michigan to one side vast and cold, Lake Charlevoix to the other. Everywhere you turn theres sand waiting for bare feet, water waiting to swallow your reflection.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old soldiers who've seen too much. Aint no matching faces here. Each one tells its own story. Some got fresh paint and new windows, others wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see from the road, dug deep into the Michigan clay. Aluminum siding gone gray with time covers most, colors faded like old photographs left in the sun.\n\nChildren run wild in the streets like scattered birds. Dogs tug at their leashes. Bikes leave thin trails in the dust. Folk here know each other. Know who belongs and who dont. They wave from their grills, smoke rising up like prayers. They nod as they pass, dogs padding alongside.\n\nThe yards stay trim, grass cut low like a military haircut. No dead leaves allowed to gather and rot. Plants stand in neat rows like prisoners. Its not beautiful in the way that makes people stop and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes them want to stay. Safe. Quiet. Like the world before it went wrong.\n\nThe jail squats at the edge of town, gray and watchful. The health department beside it like some kind of promise. Planes drone overhead from the small airport, their shadows crossing yards where baseball games echo from nearby fields. The recycling center hums its own quiet song of preservation.\n\nIce cream can be had by foot, and downtown aint far if youre of a mind to walk it. Children pedal their bikes to the park like pilgrims to a shrine, eight blocks through the heart of what we call home. This here's a place where the world still makes sense. Where people can still find their way back to what matters. A place where the day ends soft and quiet, like a prayer whispered in the dark.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in the dead heat of morning. Row upon row of them identical and stark against the pallid sky. No variation in their countenance save what the homeowners association would permit in their godlike governance of such things. Small patches of grass lay before each dwelling trimmed and manicured like cemetery plots. Gravel beds with their decorative stones bleached white in the sun. The driveways short and perfect leading to garages that could shelter two vehicles and nothing more.\n\nThey'd paved these roads not long past. Fresh concrete unmarred by time or neglect stretched out before you like a river of bone. No potholes here. No imperfection that might speak to the passage of years or the weight of vehicles gone before. Some dwellings rose two stories tall but most crouched low against the earth as if wary of drawing attention to themselves.\n\nThe mailboxes stood gathered at the street's end like prisoners awaiting judgment. Not separate markers for each home as you might expect but a congregation of metal boxes bound together, each secured by its own key. Two larger chambers for parcels that might come. The association had ordained it thus and so it remained.\n\nAt the city's edge where suburban order gave way to rural chaos the neighborhood sprawled vast and purposeful. Swimming pools lay behind iron gates available to any who lived here and could prove their belonging. Walking paths wound through the emptiness like the tracks of ancient creatures long extinct. You could walk your dog there or take evening constitutional without need of designated parkland. The retired folk who made up most of the population would watch from their windows, guardians of this manufactured peace. Young professionals moved among them like ghosts, outnumbered but tolerated.\n\nThe city itself lay fifteen minutes distant by automobile, a sprawling thing that somehow maintained its small-town pretense. One mall stood there, neither grand nor humble but sufficient to its purpose. Markets of various persuasion lined the streets from the organic temples of the wealthy to the bare-bones outlets where the poor sought sustenance.\n\nThis was a place of safety and order. A place where man had imposed his will upon the landscape and called it good. The swimming pools gleamed like blind eyes in the sun. The walking trails wound their way through carefully managed wilderness. And all of it lay just far enough from commerce to maintain its isolation while remaining within reach of every chain store and market that modern life demanded. This was civilization's compromise with chaos, and it endured.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished. Strange thing to hear in a city where folk paid thousands just to lay their heads. None I knew spoke of such tales. Maybe it's the weight of living crushing down. Some nights you hear the sobbing through the walls, through the floors. Folk learn to scrape by. Learn to love the smell of other people's castoffs, mothballed clothes and broken toys laid out on folding tables in the dust. The smell of youth dies quiet. Some take to smoking. Some just forget what clean air tastes like. But the flea market smell, it stays. Settles in like death. Smells like forgotten magazines yellowing on a dead piano. Gets in the leather and wont wash out no matter what you do.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking. Start at the far end, you can work your way through two charity shops, the library with its musty books, rare book dealer, curio shop with its shelves of dead men's treasures. Downtown's thick with bodies and machines, morning till night, but step inside them stores and the world goes quiet as a tomb. Good place to lose yourself. More of them coming every year, the bodies and machines. Growing city, they say. Some big company dealing in clicks and packages made its home here. Like New York in a way. Everyone got their own heading, don't nobody ask much of you. Can keep to yourself, quiet-like, independent. Not like down South where caring means prying. Here you can keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like waves on a dead shore.\n\nLife still moves though. Got a piano player next door, couple singers upstairs always working their scales. Less strangers sharing walls than a kind of family. Come together when needs must. Share the birthdays, the funerals, the hard times. Lucky in a way. Most of them treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. Trade favors like mail delivery. See them smile when I pass and think maybe they're glad of me like I'm glad of them. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but it's them makes me think I ain't totally lost my way after all.",
            "The town lies just beyond where the city's reach ends. A small place. Midwestern. We live on the east side where the poorest folk dwell in homes worth little more than kindling. Rental signs stand like sentries on grassless yards. But there aint no ugliness here like you might expect. Folk still nod and speak when you pass. They remember such things.\n\nViolence visits sometimes like an unwelcome relative that wont leave. Gunshots in the night. Blood on sidewalks. The neighbors boy got killed outside some bar last year. His mother still sits on that porch watching nothing. We lost a few things left outside but nothing more. The real killer here is that white powder. Fentanyl. It takes them quick and quiet. Town's got places for them that want help. Teaching folks how to bring the dead back with that Narcan. Some make it. Most dont.\n\nThe boy goes to school where they treat him right despite his differences. Good people there. Teachers that still care about such things. Parents meeting regular to plan things for the children. More than twenty of every hundred here cant feed their own so the school feeds em all. Breakfast and lunch. No child marked for being poor.\n\nThe council men build their gardens and fix their roads but mostly in the middle of town or the west side where the money lives. East side gets forgotten like an old dog under the porch. But we been here sixteen years in this little house that aint worth much but keeps the rain out. Stores enough to get by. Good people mostly. Cant imagine being nowhere else though sometimes at night I hear them shots and wonder if the devil aint living here too somewhere in them shadows.",
            "The neighborhood rises like some ancient beast from the belly of the city, its spine a ridge of weathered buildings crowned with histories dark and deep. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater stands sentinel, its marquee dead and silent now like the eyes of something long buried. Down the slope there's a place where folk gather when the nights turn warm, an arcade bar they call it, though it bears little resemblance to the penny arcades of old. They queue there in the summer months, June and July mostly, standing patient and solemn like mourners at some perpetual wake.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast and empty save for the concrete that rings it like a collar, steps carved into its throat like the marks of some ancient ceremony. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents arrayed in rows precise as headstones. Rain comes more often than snow, beating against canvas like nature's own dirge. They huddle close, these wanderers, seeking warmth in numbers, closer to the heart of things than out there in what they call the jungle. The family center stands like a beacon, offering water and soap and brief moments of dignity.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks to me, nor them proud old buildings that march down toward the sea. It's the people carrying their histories like scripture. Hilltop, they say, was once mean as a rattler, gang violence flowing through its streets like poison. Federal men came through with their badges and guns, sweeping clean what couldn't be cleaned. The stories persist, passed down like dark gospels, mother to child, stranger to stranger.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens, though outsiders still speak of danger. White folk, they say, best clear out after dark. But that's just echoes, old fears speaking with dead tongues. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass, or maybe Hilltop knows its own - them that understand how fear and ignorance breed like rats in the walls of this supposed melting pot paradise.\n\nThis is home now. These streets know me like I know them. Strangers offer warmth more often than harm. The laundry woman keeps her lights burning when the rain comes horizontal and mean. I've sat against cold concrete, thinking myself invisible as ash, only to have some passerby reach down with a five-dollar bill and words sweet as scripture: you're beautiful, they say, you're valuable. And in this place, in this moment, it rings true as gospel.",
            "They came to this place when he was thirteen summers old, before the boy had learned the ways of men. The houses stood like sentinels, two stories tall and identical in their suburban uniformity, stretched out along the asphalt road that wound through the development like a black river. The boy had no friends then but time brought him two companions, one who lived two doors down and another who dwelt further along the street. Both gone now but their ghosts remained.\n\nThe neighborhood stood unchanged. Like some photograph yellowed with age but preserved in its essence. Children's voices carried on the warm wind whenever the sun showed itself, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. Most days the streets lay quiet. No quarrels with neighbors. No strife. A place where solitude was respected save when aid was needed. Packages left on porches remained untouched, as if protected by some unspoken covenant between the dwellers of this place.\n\nThere was a park. Not more than a hundred yards distant. A place of memories both blessed and cursed. Where basketballs had arced through summer evenings and footballs spiraled against gray autumn skies. Where blood had flowed from the boy's nose one cold afternoon, crimson drops staining white winter ground. Now he brought his cousin's children there, watching them swing and slide in their innocent joy, their excitement pure and untainted by time's passing.\n\nThe streets around teemed with the foods of many nations. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All within walking distance though most now summoned their sustenance through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints squatted on corners like gargoyles, identical to those in every other suburb in this vast land. Pizza parlors too, their red signs glowing in the dusk.\n\nStores lined the streets like trading posts of old. Dry cleaners. Drug stores facing each other across the road like duelists. A grocery store bearing a name known only to those who dwelled in these northern territories. And there was the Indian store, its shelves stocked with spices and strange grains, preserved foods in jars like specimens in some exotic museum.\n\nHe thought of other neighborhoods he'd read about. Places where darkness dwelt in men's hearts and evil walked abroad in daylight. This place was not like those. Here was peace of a sort. Here was home.",
            "The college stands near where I live, a blessing of sorts in this godless stretch of urban decay. Apartment buildings rise like ancient monoliths against a gray sky, their facades weathered and worn by time's merciless march. Between them stand the bars and eateries where the young gather, counting their meager coins for watered-down spirits. One such establishment recently took on a new name, as if christening could wash away its sins of overpriced libations and indifferent service.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes: the students, temporary as morning frost, and the poor souls anchored by poverty to these crumbling walls. Children too, their voices carrying across concrete and asphalt from the schoolyard nearby. My neighbors remain strangers by choice, though their marijuana smoke seeps through walls like some spectral presence. Management's solution: a plastic box spewing artificial freshness, a joke told in the language of corporate impotence.\n\nDown the road stand new buildings, false promises wrapped in cheap materials and high rent. Their walls thin as playing cards, built by men who knew nothing of permanence. A restaurant serves microwaved sustenance on paper plates, a temple to disposable living. Beside it squats a gas station, where desperate men trade hours of their lives for dollars.\n\nThe city, in its infinite wisdom, laid new concrete paths and planted grass in strips, as if nature could be parceled and contained. My building hunkers beneath ancient trees, some now reduced to stumps like broken teeth in a dying mouth. Behind us lies 43rd Street, a darker reflection of our own, where cracked sidewalks spider-web beneath feet and buildings wear their shame openly. Crime blooms there like black mold, though it seeps across boundaries, respecting no borders we devise.\n\nYet I remain, tethered by economics and convenience to this place. The university stands within walking distance, and buses carry the carless to their destinations like modern-day ferrymen. This is my station now, among the concrete and the dying trees, in this purgatory between poverty and promise.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, their white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They'd built them to look separate but they wasnt. Folk gathered most evenings at the end of whatever drive suited them, speaking soft words while their young ones made chalk marks on the concrete or sent their kites up into that vast blue nothing. Like some forgotten time it was. A place where the mechanical world hadnt yet laid its cold hand.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up black against the sky where clouds moved like great white ships. But the weather it had turned. Last night the sirens came wailing through the darkness and we knew what was coming. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever treasures I thought to save while the big one paced the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles hitting the earth. When it was done the road steamed like some creature breathing its last and the temperature had dropped from ninety-two to seventy-five quick as a thought. The hail melted where it struck the burning pavement and then the sun broke through and the rain came again and with it two rainbows arced across the sky like some biblical covenant.\n\nThe houses stood quiet for a time after, till folk began to drift back from wherever they'd sheltered. Then it was like always. Women watching their young ones while dinner cooked inside. Different from New Hampshire this place was, forty minutes outside Charlotte where I'd come to rest. The southern voices soft and strange like music from another country. Two bedrooms and two baths in each unit though some were smaller inside than others which didnt make no sense but that's how it was.\n\nBehind the houses there was a pond where swimming wasnt allowed and I'd walk there sometimes seeing deer moving like ghosts through the morning mist while bullfrogs sang their ancient songs. Roosters called from the surrounding farms each dawn and sometimes in the evening a donkey would bray into the growing dark like he was telling the world he still drew breath. A good place it was. A place a body could call home.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Memory holds the move from Riverdale to Stockbridge like a photograph faded at the edges. Tears came then, for what was lost and what was loved, though mama and daddy had their reasons. Better schools they said. Better houses. Places where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nTime passed like water through fingers. Made friends and enemies both, though neighbors remained strangers save for Mr. Glen and Dennis living adjacent. Good folk. Like blood almost. Remember Mr. Glen's wedding clear as yesterday, him taking another wife. Caught the white garter when Ms. Veda sent it sailing through the lamplight. Danced with Marsharii that night, her face young and full of promise. Never saw her after. World swallows some whole.\n\nThe streets here wind like snakes in summer grass. GPS helps now but before it was just wandering. Me and Kason and Curtis, we'd lose ourselves in video games, in the simple pleasure of being young and alive. Sometimes I'd walk alone to the park where the trees stand sentinel. Brought sticks from the hardware store to practice balance, brought the wooden sword too. Something holy in that solitude.\n\nCourts there for basketball and tennis both, empty now but waiting. Daddy and Mr. Graves taught us tennis years back, worked us till our muscles burned and our hearts sang. Good times those were. Simple times.\n\nReckon there's more stories buried in these streets than I could tell in a day. But these are the ones that stick like burrs to the soul, that won't shake loose no matter how far you walk. And somewhere ahead the future waits, patient as stone, holding whatever comes next in its dark hands.",
            "Johnston lay there in the South Carolina heat like some forgotten outpost of civilization. A town that breathed peaches. The welcome sign proclaimed it proud, Peach Capital of the World, though the world had long since moved on from such declarations. Fields stretched out beyond sight, peach trees standing sentinel over the cattle that grazed in the spaces between. Houses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming under the merciless sun or gray shingles dulled by time and weather, each dwelling an island in the agricultural sea.\n\nThe town center nothing more than a single stoplight swaying in the wind at a fourway crossing, watching over the few establishments that clung to existence there. Hong Kong, run by a family whose story was never told. Fiesta Mexican. Gary's with its burgers. The pizzeria long gone now, its windows dark and empty like dead eyes. Maxwell and Halford Drug still poured cherry cola like some remnant of an older time. IGA stood charging prices that drove folk twenty miles to Batesburg-Leesville where the Walmart waited like some retail paradise.\n\nDollar General remained the heart of it all, its fluorescent pulse drawing people from sunup to sundown. Possibilities Furniture & More occupied its corner, the owner's kindness a currency more valuable than money, her two movers like disciples of her trade. Next door the pet groomer tended to the town's companions, washing and clipping away the dust of rural life.\n\nThe doctor and the vet practiced their arts in quiet buildings away from the center, treating the living things of Johnston with what tools they had. The elementary school stood alone, releasing its children to other towns once they grew too old for its walls. They were building a park now, two and a half acres of hope for a future that might never come.\n\nNo theaters here. No bowling alleys. No places for youth to gather and dream of escape. Just the road through town, quick enough to miss in a blink, like a dream you cant quite remember come morning. The town endured, neither dying nor truly living, suspended in the humid air like a peach not yet ready to fall.",
            "The street runs between two highways like a vein between arteries, carrying the lifeblood of traffic past our house that stands sentinel at the corner where the pavement bends. Tennessee. Small town. The kind of place where folk dont come and go much anymore, like the world done forgot about it somehow. We watch them all from here, me and the wife and the two girls, eleven and fourteen, watching through windows like pale ghosts in a house that's become our world entire.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out before us like some dying thing, houses scattered among trees that was here long before any of us. Folk go about their business like they always have. Mowing grass till the machines sound like theyre calling to one another across the yards, March through October when the grass finally yields to the coming cold. Then the leaves begin their death march, drifting down in browns and reds till they carpet the ground and we burn them, the smoke rising up like prayers in the autumn air.\n\nWinter ain't what it used to be. More like autumn that won't die, hanging on past its time. The children still find their way down the hill on sleds when the snow comes, which ain't often anymore. Most days its just bikes and dogs and walkers moving through the street like specters in some half-remembered dream.\n\nThe garage stands at the back of the house where I work on my truck, doors open to the world like wounds. Front door might as well be sealed shut for all we use it. Holidays bring the strangers, cars lined up and down the street like mourners at a wake. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and they go and the street returns to its silence.\n\nSometimes we cook out back, smoke rising from the grill like signals to whoever might be watching. Sometimes we play in the rain, the water washing away whatever sins we might have gathered. But mostly we just watch. Watch the cars pass, watch the seasons change, watch the neighbors move through their lives like actors in some great theater we cant quite understand. This street, this life, this endless procession of days. It'd be perfect if it weren't for the traffic. But nothing's perfect anymore. Maybe it never was.",
            "The land stretches out brown and dead, nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. Dirt and more dirt still. Nobody knows what it means less they lived here, less they woke each morning to that vast brown emptiness, the rare patch of green lawn standing like some rich man's mockery of nature itself. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart, scattered like bones across the waste. Still do mostly, though new structures rise up now, civilization creeping in slow but steady like some horrid tide.\n\nPlace grows more citified with each passing season though that's the way of things everywhere now. Folk here are kindly enough but like anywhere there's good and there's bad and there's worse. My patch is ringed with old folk, friendly enough, marking this as one of the better places though that don't mean much. The stores are all them chain operations. Food For Less. Smart and Final. Nothing fancy. You want that kind of thing you got to travel and even then.\n\nConstruction work's what keeps most alive out here. Not from reading no statistics but from watching. Makes sense with all this empty space waiting to be filled. That thought sits in my gut like a stone. Left the big city to get away from all that. Now I work construction myself, hanging drywall and ceiling bars, watching the spread of it.\n\nBut it's the animals make this place what it is. Folk come here for different reasons but mainly it's the stark beauty of it, the challenge of it. Desert's got its own rules, its own way of being. Got creatures living here can't live nowhere else. Human folk best learn to live alongside em proper. My young ones took to it natural. Even now they're out there hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen, learning the ways of this hard land.\n\nTown's got its attractions if you want em. County fair comes through regular. Folks head up to Wrightwood when they need to see snow, learn to slide down mountains for sport. Museum's got old bones and Indian things, tells how this place came to be what it is. But that ain't what matters. What matters is the desert itself, vast and empty, waiting patient as stone while we scurry bout building our little lives atop it, temporary as morning dew.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete labyrinth. Gray and godless. He reckons it his neighborhood though he knows such words mean little now. Not like the neighborhoods of old where families dwelt in their separate houses and children played in streets now long dead and gone.\n\nThe buildings rise up like ancient monoliths. Three kinds there are. The apartments first, stacked two stories high with their identical windows staring out blind and dark. Twenty souls perhaps in each one, though he cannot be sure. Then the houses proper, scattered few and far between, where the old guard dwells. Alumni they're called, though such words mean little now. And last the dormitories, great concrete hives where hundreds sleep two by two in cells no bigger than prison holds.\n\nThe people here are of all kinds and colors, though that matters little now. The elders keep to their houses while the young ones crowd the dorms and the ones between take the apartments. Like some great sorting of souls, each to their designated place in this concrete purgatory.\n\nThere are stores too, though they ain't like the stores of old. Places to eat and places to buy clothes marked with symbols of learning. A single park remains, kept clean by some unspoken covenant among those who dwell here. At night it lies empty and dark, the swings creaking soft in the wind like hanging men.\n\nHe studies it all through eyes grown tired of looking. This is his neighborhood now, this place of learning and waiting. Self-contained and sealed off from the world beyond like some great ark adrift on a sea of asphalt and concrete. He knows no other home now. Knows too that home is just a word, like neighborhood, like community. Words that mean less with each passing day.\n\nBut still they persist here, all of them, in their concrete caves and their borrowed beds. Still they wake each morning and go about their rituals of learning, as if such things still matter in a world grown strange and cold. Perhaps they do. Perhaps this is all that's left to them now. This place. These people. This neighborhood that ain't really a neighborhood at all.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward from where the house stands like some ancient sentinel at the peak of what they call the workout hill, though there aint nothing about exercise in its nature. Just gravity and the weight of things. Folk walk in the road cause there aint no choice about it. The pavement's broke and scarred like an old fighter's face, pocked with holes that'll tear the heart out of any vehicle daring enough to pass. Above it all hang the wires, patched and mended like a vagrant's coat, victims of countless storms that rake through here regular as grief. The repairmen come and go and the wires get uglier.\n\nTrees rise up everywhere. Tall evergreens that folk hate cause they block the view of the water. They cut em down with a vengeance born of greed, building their glass houses higher and higher, reaching up like drowning men for a glimpse of the bay. At sunset the water burns like molten copper but mostly its hidden behind clouds thick as wool blankets, the light filtering through like some weak memory of brightness. The damp claims everything here. Moss creeps across the world like a plague, turning roofs and cars and metal to green fur. Left my own vehicle out once and nature took it back, took three hours of scraping to reclaim it from the green.\n\nAint many children. Just old folk waiting out their days, and dogs. Dogs everywhere, running wild and free, sneaking into houses like thieves through any door left open by the careless. Found one in my living room once, staring at me like I was the intruder. The rabbits too, big as cats some of them, tearing up gardens till my cats hunted em down. Birds pass through - sparrows, hummingbirds small as thoughts, and sometimes a hawk floating overhead till the crows drive it off like some dark army protecting their territory.\n\nDown by the water there's places to eat what the bay provides, though there aint much beach to speak of. Just rocks for throwing into the gray water. The opposite shore sits out there in the mist like some dream of civilization, close enough to see but too far to touch. Just watching and waiting while the fog rolls in.",
            "They say Bensonhurst aint hard to find. The trains come and go like metal serpents through the concrete canyons of Brooklyn, carrying souls worn thin by the city's weight. The streets lay dark and solemn beneath perpetual sheets of gray sky.\n\nThe neighborhood bears its own particular darkness. Not the darkness of empty places but the darkness of too many souls pressed together in weathered buildings that stand like tired sentinels. Asian letters flash their neon promises from every storefront, marking territory claimed over decades past. Supermarkets and laundromats line the streets like prayer beads on a rosary, each one identical to the last, each one necessary as breath.\n\nWhere I stand now there are four markets within sight of each other, their windows fogged with steam and voices speaking in tongues I do not know. The people here are pilgrims all, first and second sons of immigrants seeking something they cannot name. The businesses belong mostly to the Asians now, their industry as relentless as the tide.\n\nThey built a park nearby. Ten courts for basketball where children play their endless games. Soccer fields stretch out like dead grass seas. Handball courts stand silent as tombs until filled with the echo of rubber balls and young voices. A fountain spits water in summer months, blessing the children with temporary baptism.\n\nThe buildings here are low and humble. No glass towers reach for God. Just homes stacked two deep where families weather the long nights. Music bleeds from passing cars like wounds, engines roar their defiance at the dawn. Nights bring their own particular terrors. The streets grow teeth. Men with hollow eyes seek prey among the shadows.\n\nI knew their violence once. Felt fists against flesh, learned the taste of blood and fear. Now thieves hunt packages left on stoops like carrion birds. And everywhere the dogs leave their offerings, ignored by masters who have forgotten the meaning of civilization. The city fines mean nothing here where law is just a whisper carried away by wind.\n\nWatch your step in Bensonhurst. The concrete remembers everything it has seen.",
            "You got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon fore you can understand the place itself. Written up on some building that serves pizza and liquor and flesh and music and probably breaks half dozen laws doing it are the words Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say its bout remembering the old days when the city wasnt so known and wasnt so dear and folk could make something different of themselves here. Others hear it like a calling. Come to Portland theyd say. We'll call you weird here too but we'll mean it kind.\n\nThe Californians came with their money and their condos rose like concrete weeds from the earth but Portland stayed weird all the same. Not that weird means kind exactly. More like accepting things others wont accept. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere else in this godforsaken country. Weird aint about that.\n\nIn my part of town the houses stand painted in colors that'd make a carnival jealous. Gardens growing wild with herbs and flowers pressing up through cracks in the sidewalk like nature trying to take back whats hers. And there's them free boxes. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic. Like offerings to whatever gods still care to look down on us. Books and clothes mostly but could be anything. Something bout walking these streets in Southeast makes you believe in magic again. Least thats how I see it but Im just one kind of weird in this city of thousands.\n\nSome folk wouldnt touch nothing from a sidewalk box. They do their yoga with goats. Yes real goats. Or they go watch them Timbers kick a ball round a field. Portland's got all kinds. Dreamers and drunks and them that cant tell the difference no more.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray and constant like God crying. Brings the darkness in peoples minds. We got drugs here sure. Got homeless too. More than most places cause we try to help em but we dont help enough. Never enough. The rest of us we care bout em or we hate em depending on the day. In that we aint weird at all. Just human. Poor sorry humans same as anywhere else.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel. Always there in the north, bearing witness to the coming and going of light like some ancient gods carved from stone. A man might forget them in the daily toil of existence but they remain, unmoved and unchanging, like thoughts in the mind of God. When the weight of living becomes too much they call out with their silence and a man might look upon them and find some measure of peace in their permanence.\n\nI came here first as a young man. The university stretched out below them peaks like some congregation before an altar. Fine buildings there were and pools of water reflecting the sky and trees that had stood longer than any man's memory but it was them mountains that held dominion over all. The town beneath grew like weeds in the shadow of stone. Coffee houses with their bitter smell where young folk bent over books in the small hours. The downtown with its old brick worn smooth by time and weather, buildings pressed together like folk huddled against the cold. For them few blocks it was like some greater city had sprouted up out of the quiet earth but that feeling passed quick as it came once you walked past the library.\n\nMemories collect in such places like water in a basin. Some sweet and some bitter. Walking with friends past playground swings gone to rust in the darkness after studying all night. Running through crowded streets to catch some picture show in that fancy theater. But there were darker times too. Sitting by them ponds at two in the morning watching ducks and turtles going about their business while inside your head the darkness grows. Watching them creatures each with their purpose while your own seems lost in the vastness of living.\n\nSo I walked. Past the pond and the park and them little houses all lined up neat like graves. When I reached the main road the sun was coming up, painting everything in fire and shadow. Palm trees stood like sentries and above it all them mountains remained. Cutting into that fire-touched sky like they had done since before man walked upright. And something in that permanence spoke without speaking. Some truth older than words about carrying on. About enduring.",
            "You wouldnt see it at first passing. Just retail facades and empty lots where folk once shopped for organic produce and whatnot. But beyond the dead Whole Foods and past them hotels that only breathe life when summer brings the reunions of blood kin, there's a whole world moving and breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like great concrete monoliths laid out in perfect succession, each one watching the other in some kind of architectural vigil. First ones got darkness in their history. Best leave them be. Truth aint always what papers tell.\n\nBeyond these stands another world. Silent. Unknown to most. College buildings squatting low against the earth, students dragging themselves through iron gates that screech like dying things in the dawn light. Traffic backed up while morning folk curse from their vehicles, their words lost in the heavy air.\n\nRoad ends at a T, park on one side and them bone-mending folks on the other. Their porch with its wicker chairs and that ceiling fan turning slow circles in air thick as molasses. Children spinning themselves through the grass like gyroscopes while bees work the flowers growing wild by the roadside. Old ones walking their dogs, eyeing the young ones on their boards with suspicion born of years. Girls gather like birds on playground metal, speaking secrets about boys and whatever moving pictures light up their phones these days.\n\nStrip mall stands sentinel. Sushi joint never full but keeping on somehow. Swimming store. Nail place. All of it lined up neat like artifacts in some museum of modern living. Frozen yogurt spot drawing them young ones like moths, their cups sweating in the heat while they show off on wheels and breathe sweet smoke into the heavy air, thinking themselves immortal.\n\nThis here's a piece of the old south. Time moves different here. Like molasses in winter. Everything preserved in amber, waiting. Just waiting.",
            "The houses stood like ancient sentinels. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still in their weathered communion. Small yards stretched before them and narrow drives lay alongside like pale wounds in the earth. They spoke of times past when suburban living was the dream that held this country in its grip but that dream was loosening now like a rope worn thin by time and weather. Yet these neighborhoods persisted. Called out their testament to any who'd listen that the dream hadnt died entirely.\n\nThe people walked different now. Less hope in their step. Yards gone wild where once they'd been kept pristine but still the cars sat in drives two by two like creatures waiting for the flood. Children played in the streets as if the world ended at its borders. The school stood ninety years strong conjuring futures in the young while stirring ghosts in the old. Churches sparse and empty but the basketball courts filled with life and motion. Houses different as thumbprints but kindred somehow in their bones.\n\nSuper A they called it. Run by Yemenis, perhaps the only Arab folk for miles in this sea of black faces. Streets wide as rivers where children played their games, scattering like starlings when cars approached. Folk here could trace their blood back generations in this place. Tell tales of when neighbor knew neighbor like kin.\n\nWhere once stood a karate school now stood a pharmacy. Dreams of martial glory faded with the moving pictures that spawned them. Pills took their place. The old theatre still showed its ancient reels, saved from crowds by young folk's scorn but blessed by the elders who found comfort in its dimness, away from children's eyes.\n\nA single highway passed through but never touched ground here. Young ones wanted an exit built but the elders knew better. Knew that progress was just another word for death. They were building a new school now. Talking of mascots. Some spoke of a mechanical man with a country drawl and a cabin of logs. But in this place nothing was ever truly new. Just old things wearing different faces.",
            "The city sprawls vast and merciless before him. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a gray sky that holds neither promise nor redemption. Streets wind through the maze of steel and glass, some bearing names in foreign tongues - Koreatown, Little Armenia - each a world sealed within itself. Traffic moves like blood through clogged arteries, two hours to traverse ten miles, the vehicles packed together in mindless congregation.\n\nHe studies the neighborhood from his window. Orthodox Jews in black coats moving like shadows through the morning light. Soviet refugees carrying their histories like wounds that won't heal. Rainbow flags hanging limp in windows, testaments to loves that dare speak their names. All of them moving through the same dead space, breathing the same tired air.\n\nThe parks stand like green islands in the concrete sea. Children play there still, their voices carrying across time itself, reminiscent of days when he too ran wild with the neighbor boy, before the world grew cold and strange. Now neighbors pass like ghosts, nameless, faceless, sealed behind walls and doors that never open.\n\nConstruction cranes loom against the horizon like ancient siege machines. New towers rising, steel bones reaching skyward, while below the streets grow more congested, more choked with each passing season. Parking spaces become rare as gold. The city devours itself and grows hungry still.\n\nHouses crouch between the towers - single homes, duplexes, small apartment blocks - each one a universe unto itself. Some dating back to times when people still knew their neighbors' names, when communities weren't just words in real estate listings. But those days are gone now, gone like smoke in the wind, like all things must go.\n\nThe streets fill and empty, fill and empty, an endless tide of humanity washing through the concrete canyons. Each soul carrying its own story, its own burden, moving through the vastness alone. The city holds them all, indifferent as God, while the sun wheels overhead in a sky the color of beaten lead.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn. This is it, I told her. She'd never known such emptiness, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The corn stretched out beyond sight, row upon row like soldiers in formation, waiting. I told her bout growing up here in Ohio country, watching recognition dawn in her eyes like the slow light of morning.\n\nPast the water-filled quarry the houses rose up from the earth, brick and stucco set back from the road on half-acre plots tended like holy ground. Spring brought forth flowers planted by hands that knew the seasons, knew the trees that died and lived again with each turn of the year. Mercedes machines gleamed in driveways like chrome beasts drinking the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived three houses down, always outside, always singing above his mower's drone. Doctor once, they said. Now just a man who'd lost pieces of himself to time, melding with the grass and his green John Deere like some strange hybrid creature born of lawn and machine.\n\nOur house stood grey against grey sky. Geese claimed the side yard til the terrier drove them off. Behind lay the stream that fed the quarry, carrying bullfrog song and cattle lowing from distant pastures. Cross the wooden bridge we built with our hands and you'd find yourself in untamed country. Wild flowers and herbs grew there among trees that knew no master.\n\nThis was where childhood lived. Where we built fortresses in trees and stalked imaginary prey. Where neighborhood children appeared like spirits through the brush, companions in our wild games.\n\nWinter came hard and merciless but brought its own terrible beauty. The yard transformed from living green to dead white wilderness. Trees that once bloomed pink and purple stood naked now, their dark bones reaching toward leaden sky. Snow came in the night like judgment, covering all. My sister's angels lay scattered in drifts while snowmen stood sentinel. We warred with packed ice, building frozen ramparts to shield our arsenal of winter weapons. Here in our sealed white world we played at life while real life waited somewhere beyond the fields, beyond the corn, beyond our knowing. We were children then. We knew nothing of what waited."
