            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Small town Michigan where the farmland bleeds into tourist towns like blood seeping through gauze. Aint no malls here. No Walmart. No chain restaurants with their neon signs burning holes in the night. Everything's a drive. But Lord if it aint beautiful, this water-blessed land. My piece of earth sits between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix like a child between two vast mothers. Water everywhere you turn. Always some shore waiting to swallow your feet.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks of small places, of lives lived close to the ground. Houses stand apart from each other like stubborn old men, each one different, each one carrying its years in its own way. Some got new faces, others wear their age plain. Most got basements you can see from the road, like bones showing through worn skin. Aluminum siding gone gray and weary on many. Colors everywhere though, like God himself couldn't make up his mind.\n\nYards stretch out wild and lived-in. Trampolines standing like black metal insects. Garden plots where folks work the earth with their hands. Fences holding dogs and memories. These houses, they hold Middle America. Working folk who wake up tired and go to bed tired and somewhere in between raise up their young.\n\nChildren run these streets like water. Dogs and bikes and roller skates. Neighbors know each other's shadows. They can smell a stranger. Folk grilling in their yards raise a hand to passersby, dog walkers nod like old friends. The grass stays cut, the bushes trimmed, leaves dont linger come autumn. Aint beautiful like them magazine neighborhoods, but its good. Safe. The kind of place where you can lay your head down at night and know your children sleep easy.\n\nSheriff's office sits close enough to walk to. Health department too. Recycling center down the way where trucks come and go like mechanical pilgrims. Baseball fields echo with voices calling names into the evening air. Small planes growl overhead from the town airport, their engines speaking in tongues only pilots know. Ice cream place is walking distance. Downtown too if your legs are willing. Children can ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through these quiet streets where everyone knows everyone and the water's always waiting at the edge of town.\n\nThis is my place. This is where we are.",
            "The houses stood like grave markers in that suburban waste. Row after row of them identical and mute beneath the scorching sun. No character to speak of save what the homeowners association deemed fit in their godless pursuit of uniformity. Each yard a mirror of the last. Small patches of grass maintained with religious fervor and decorative stone scattered like the bones of some ancient thing and driveways too short for any proper use. Trees stood dwarfed and regulated, testimony to man's desire to control even nature herself.\n\nThe concrete roads stretched pristine and perfect through the development, unmarred by time or wear as if laid down yesterday though they weren't. No mailboxes stood sentry before the homes like in times past. Instead they'd built communal boxes at the street's end, all locked away behind cold metal doors with two larger chambers for packages, as if the very act of mail delivery needed to be sanitized and controlled.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the city's edge where suburbia met the wild lands in an uneasy truce. They'd built pools there, gated and watched, and walking trails that wound through what remained of the natural world. Retired folk mostly inhabited these parts now, with some younger professionals mixed in like pepper in salt. They watched each other with practiced vigilance, each serving as the other's keeper in this manufactured paradise.\n\nThe city itself sprawled vast but retained something of its small-town heart, like a child trying on its father's clothes. One mall stood testament to progress, neither grand nor humble but sufficient to its purpose. Fifteen minutes drive in any direction would take you to the temples of commerce - stores high and low, from the organic sanctuaries of the wealthy to the bare-bones outlets where the poor sought sustenance.\n\nThe whole of it lay there beneath the empty sky, safe and maintained and typical as a dream. A place where even chaos had been ordered into submission, where wildness had been tamed and packaged for consumption. Where you could drive your car to any chain store your heart desired, so long as you were willing to trade fifteen minutes of your life to get there.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the missing. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more each month to inhabit and none had spoken of such tales before. Not my companions nor any other soul. Perhaps it's the weight of living that silences them. Some nights you can hear them weeping through the walls, my friends, crushed under the burden of survival. Time teaches you to live lean. You learn to love the scent of secondhand things, those castoff toys and clothes wrapped in time's shroud. The nose grows dull with age. Some take to tobacco. Others just forget what clean truly meant.\n\nBut the markets of the poor persist. They smell of adulthood itself, like magazines gone yellow atop a piano that ain't been opened in years. The smell works its way into leather and stays, defying soap and water both. Three such stores stand within walking distance. Starting from the far end you can make your pilgrimage through two charity shops, past the library, through a place that trades in rare books, ending at the curiosity shop. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but them shops stay quiet as tombs. Silent sanctuaries where afternoon light dies slow.\n\nYear by year the city grows fat with cars and bodies. They call it development. Some great digital empire made its throne here, and the city groans with growing pains like New York before it. Everyone carries their own purpose here, asks nothing of nobody. A man can wrap himself in solitude and none will try to pierce that shell. Not like down South where concern passes for caring. Here the city breaks against you like waves on stone and recedes just the same.\n\nLife moves through the walls. A pianist dwells next door, two would-be singers above. Less strangers sharing walls than a fellowship of sorts. We come together in need, mark births and deaths alike, extend help when we can. Fortune smiled on me in this. My neighbors treat me kindly and I do the same. I mind my mess and share my food and they return the gesture. We pass letters between us like sacred things. I've made my home in this concrete labyrinth but it's them that makes it bearable. Makes me think I ain't ruined everything after all.",
            "The town lies just beyond the reach of the city, a small midwestern place where the wind carries stories of better days. On the east side where we dwell the houses stand weathered and wanting, their paint peeling like old scabs, rented or bought by those who carry little in their pockets save hope and copper pennies. But there aint no ugliness here. The people nod and speak when you pass. They remember what courtesy means in a world that's forgotten.\n\nThe violence comes sometimes like a thief in the night. Gunshots echo in the darkness. People disappear. The neighbors lost their boy outside a bar last year, his blood soaking into cracked pavement while music played inside. We've been spared such grief save for the occasional taking of things left too long on the porch, like offerings to hungry ghosts.\n\nThe poison that men call fentanyl has worked its way through the veins of this town like a slow cancer. Bodies stack up in the morgue while the living learn to push needles of salvation into dying flesh. Narcan they call it. A resurrection in a bottle.\n\nThe boy goes to school where good people still work at being good. Special needs, they say, but he aint never been treated as less than whole. The teachers remember what kindness means. They feed all the children here, knowing hunger dont care about pride. Twenty percent below the poverty line, the numbers say, but numbers dont tell about the heart of things.\n\nThe city men work their improvements in the center of town and the west side where the money flows. Fresh pavement, new trees, parks where children play. But the east side waits like a forgotten child, watching its brothers get new shoes while its own feet stay bare.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint worth much in dollars but it keeps out the rain and holds our memories. The people here they get by. They remember what community means. Sometimes at night I stand on the porch and listen to the town breathing, all its broken dreams and stubborn hopes rising up like smoke from chimneys in winter. This is home. There aint no other place we'd rather be.",
            "The neighborhood set upon the hill like some ancient fortress, buildings standing sentinel with their histories etched deep in mortar and stone. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater stands dark and brooding, its marquee dead these many years. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather when the warmth comes, an arcade where beer flows and laughter echoes against brick walls. Lines of them standing patient in the summer dark, waiting their turn at whatever salvation lies within.\n\nThe park spreads vast above it all, ringed in concrete like the walls of some forgotten coliseum. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents lined neat as gravestones along the steps where the rain beats its endless dirge. They huddle close, these wanderers, seeking warmth in numbers, closer to where mercy flows from shower heads and soap dispensers in the family center down below.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks to me, nor them proud buildings reaching toward whatever god might still be watching. It's the people carrying their histories like scars. Hilltop, they called it, when blood ran in gutters and federal men swept through like locusts, badges glinting, taking what they would. Stories pass like scripture now, whispered in doorways, told to newcomers like me who came seeking something real.\n\nWhite folk dont walk these streets after dark, they say, though that warning rings hollow as an old church bell, echoing from days when fear ruled these blocks. Maybe its that my skin carries enough shadow to pass, or maybe the Hill sees in me what it sees in itself - the weight of old wounds, the knowing that fear and ignorance still poison the well we all drink from.\n\nThese streets know me now. They've sheltered me when rain fell like judgment. Seen me huddled against concrete while strangers passed carrying kindness like lanterns in the dark. Five dollars pressed into a cold palm, words of worth spoken soft as prayer. The Hill claims its own, and I am claimed, marked by this place where laundromat lights burn late for them that need charging, where jackets appear like miracles on cold shoulders.\n\nThis is home. These streets. These people. This history written in brick and blood and mercy. The Hill abides, and I abide with it.",
            "When I came to this place I was just a boy, not yet fourteen, the houses standing like sentinels in the dull August heat. Making friends dont come easy to a boy that age but there was two others lived close by, one two doors down and another somewhere along that same street. They're gone now but the memories aint. Most that was here then is here still. Houses like you'd see anywhere in this country, two stories high with vinyl siding gone gray in the weather, pressed together like old friends sharing secrets. Summer weekends you can hear the children, their voices carrying across yards gone brown in the heat, their laughter echoing off aluminum gutters and chain link fences.\n\nQuiet mostly. The kind of quiet that speaks to something deeper than just the absence of sound. Folk here mind their own unless there's need otherwise. Packages come and stay where they're left. Trust aint something you find easy these days but here it remains like some relic of an older time.\n\nThe park sits just beyond where the houses end. Basketball courts where the asphalt's cracked and weeds push through. Football fields where blood was spilled, my own once when some boy's elbow found my nose. But that aint what I remember most. What I remember is the good times, times that seem now like they belonged to someone else. These days I take my cousin's young ones there. Watch them on the swings, their legs pumping at the sky like they might touch it if they just try hard enough.\n\nThe streets here are a patchwork of cultures pressed together like pages in an old book. Chinese food and Mexican. Indian spices carrying on the wind. Italian too. Most folk now they just press buttons on their phones and food appears like magic at their doors. Fast food mostly, pizza too. All the stores a body could need. Cleaners where shirts hang like pale ghosts in windows. Drug stores facing each other across the street like gunslingers. Grocery stores with their fluorescent glow spilling onto empty parking lots at night. Even got an Indian store where spices sit in glass jars like jewels.\n\nWhen I hear tell of other places, neighborhoods where folk cant trust their own shadow, I know what we got here is something rare. Something worth holding onto. Like finding water in a desert, or truth in a world gone mad with lies.",
            "The college loomed beyond the treeline, a concrete sentinel watching over streets that held no memory of better days. The apartment buildings stood like weathered tombstones, their facades grayed and peeling in the filtered sunlight. Forty-second street lay before him like a promise, newly paved, the sidewalks clean and wide, but behind it forty-third crouched in shadow, its concrete broken and heaved up like the bones of something long dead.\n\nHe walked past the bars where students gathered, their laughter carrying across empty lots where weeds pushed through cracked asphalt. The new place charged more now, but they all did. Money was just paper anyway, worthless as the leaves that skittered across the fresh-laid sod between road and walk.\n\nThe air was thick with smoke. Not tobacco but that sweet cloying scent that seeped from beneath his neighbors' door. Management had mounted their plastic defense against it, a small box that wheezed out artificial spring. A joke if there ever was one.\n\nBehind the buildings the trees stood sentinel, their branches reaching like gnarled fingers over rooftops. Some had been cut, their stumps testament to man's constant war with nature. Beyond them lay forty-third street where the shadows grew longer and darker, where sirens wailed more often in the night. The buildings there wore their decay like a shroud, their windows staring blind and empty at passersby.\n\nThe new apartments down the way were false prophets, pretty shells built quick and cheap, drawing in the faithful with promises their thin walls couldn't keep. The restaurant across served microwaved dreams on paper plates, and the gas station's fluorescent lights cast their sickly glow over minimum wage desperation.\n\nBut it was home. The buses came and went like mechanical heartbeats, carrying their human cargo to and from the city's core. The university waited within walking distance, its presence both salvation and curse. He could afford to exist here, in this liminal space between prosperity and decay, where the trees still grew thick enough to hide whatever truths men wished to keep hidden.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, white porches hanging off them like bones, green metal roofs catching what light there was. Each built to mirror the other yet standing alone in their own right. Folk gathered some evenings in driveways unspoken and predetermined, their voices carrying across the settling dusk while young ones drew their chalk figures on the ground or sent their kites up into the darkening sky. Like some remembrance of times past, before the world grew cold with its screens and circuits.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up against a sky that carried clouds white as burial shrouds. But the weather turned mean. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark like some mechanical banshee and we all scattered to our holes. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever precious things I thought to save while the big one paced and barked at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles spilling across the earth.\n\nWhen it was done the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cold. Ninety-two degrees to seventy-five in the time it takes to draw breath. The ice melted where it fell on the burning pavement and then the sun broke through and the rain came with it. Twin rainbows rose up out of nothing like some biblical covenant. Took pictures with the camera though they couldn't capture what was there. The truth of it.\n\nThe streets stayed quiet a while longer till folk emerged from wherever they'd sheltered, like survivors of some great catastrophe. Then life resumed its rhythm. Women and children out while supper cooked inside. Northern girl gone south, I found myself taken by their slow sweet way of talking. My rooms different from my neighbors though the shells that held them looked the same from without. Some smaller than they had any right to be.\n\nI walk the field out back sometimes down to where the pond lies still and dark. Deer move through the morning mist and bullfrogs sound their ancient songs. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters call across the dawn from farms I cannot see and sometimes in the evening the donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding some lost coin in the dirt. Something precious that had been waiting there all along.",
            "Ten years in this place. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. When we first come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept like a child cause I was one. Mama and daddy said it was for the better. Better houses better schools. Less of what folk called ghetto though words like that dont mean much when youre leaving behind what you know.\n\nTime passed like it does. Made friends. Made enemies too. Neighbors stayed strange except for Mr Glen and Dennis living right aside us. Good folk. Like blood almost. I member Mr Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him getting hitched again and all of us there dancing. Ms Veda in her white dress throwing that little leg strap that I caught though the flowers passed me by. Danced with Marsharii that night. His daughter. Aint seen her since and sometimes I wonder where the wind took her.\n\nThe streets here wind like snakes in summer. Got myself a GPS now but back then it was all guesswork. Used to roam with Kason and Curtis. Playing them games and living like time would never catch us. Sometimes I'd take to the park. Still do. Something in the quiet there speaks truth. Carry sticks from the hardware store. Practice balance. Bring my wooden sword too sometimes. Just a man and his thoughts among the trees.\n\nCourts there too. Basketball and tennis both though I aint played neither in what feels like forever. Daddy and Mr Graves taught me and my friend the ways of tennis. Worked us till we could hardly stand but there was joy in it. Joy in all of it maybe.\n\nReckon theres more stories buried in these streets than I could tell. More yet to come too. Time dont stop its turning for no man but sometimes it gives you something worth holding onto. Sometimes thats enough.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, sprawled across South Carolina dirt, nothing special save for what grew from its soil. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World the sign said, standing stark against the sky like some proclamation of glory long past. Fields stretched out beyond sight, peach trees marching in endless rows like soldiers frozen in formation, and between them cattle grazed on whatever the hard earth would yield.\n\nHouses stood back from the road like shy children, most wearing metal crowns to ward off the merciless southern sun, others topped with shingles gray as tombstones. They didnt crowd together but kept their distance, each surrounded by its own kingdom of dirt and grass where man and beast sought their living.\n\nThe town proper wasnt much. One stoplight swaying in the wind where four roads met. Three places to quiet your hunger: Hong Kong where a single family worked their days away, Fiesta where Mexico lived in exile, and Garys where burgers died daily deaths. The pizza place was gone now. Just gone.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug still stood, known more for its cherry cola than any medicine it might dispense. The IGA market charged dear for its goods and most folks drove the long miles to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, their tires eating up the asphalt like hungry ghosts. But the Dollar General, that was different. From dawn till dusk it breathed people in and out like some great retail beast.\n\nPossibilities Furniture sat there with its two movers and its kind woman owner who everyone knew, and next door Clarks dealt in the grooming of pets, washing and cutting and watching over the animals folks couldn't keep at home. The doctors both for man and beast kept to themselves on the edge of things, small operations but enough for what the town required.\n\nOne school was all they had. After that the children went elsewhere, like seeds scattered by the wind. They were building something they called a park, two and a half acres of hope that might bring new life to the town, but for now there wasnt much. No picture shows, no bowling, no place for young folk to gather or children to play or dogs to run. But it was a town all the same, so small you might pass through it between one breath and the next, like a dream you cant quite remember when you wake.",
            "He lived there with his wife and the two girls, eleven and fourteen, in that southern place where two highways met. The street between them carried more traffic than a man might want but they'd grown used to its sounds like you grow used to the sound of your own breathing. The neighborhood stood quiet mostly. Folk didn't come and go much. They knew the faces and the vehicles that belonged and those that didn't belong stood out like strange dogs.\n\nThe house sat on the corner where they could watch it all. Watch the people doing what people do. Mowing grass and raking leaves and living out their days. In winter the children would take to sledding down the hill on the side street, their voices carrying through the cold air like birds. He and his worked from home and they lived their lives in full view of everyone else who lived there, playing even in the rain sometimes, grilling meat on the back deck where the smoke would rise up through the trees that had been there longer than any of them.\n\nFrom March clear through to October you could hear somebody's mower running somewhere. The neighborhood had been woods once and still kept its trees, kept its shade, kept its yearly tithe of leaves that needed burning when fall came. He liked that smell. Lately the winters had gone soft, like fall just stretched on forever without end.\n\nThe garage stood at the back and that's where they came and went mostly, front door silent as a tomb except for the rare stranger's knock. He'd work on his truck sometimes with the garage doors standing open, feeling the pulse of the neighborhood like a man feels his own heartbeat. Holidays brought the quiet broken by visiting kin, cars parked everywhere like bright beetles. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. All them days when families remember they're families.\n\nIt wasn't a bad place to live. If it weren't for that through street it might have been perfect. But perfect ain't for this world, he reckoned. Never was.",
            "The high desert stretches out before me like some vast and ancient thing. Dirt and more dirt. Brown upon brown. Unless you lived here you wouldnt know how it gets inside you, that endless brown, and when you see green its like finding money, knowing full well somebody's bleeding themselves dry to keep it. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart like survivors of some plague but now they're closing in. The city grows like a cancer but I reckon everywhere does these days.\n\nFolk here are mostly good but like anywhere theres darkness too. My patch is full of old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind their curtains. The stores are all chains, Food for Less and such, nothing special. You want better you got to drive. Construction runs through this place like a backbone, men building more houses in the empty spaces that shrink year by year. Makes me uneasy. Left the big city once and dont aim to live in another.\n\nI work the drywall myself, putting up walls and ceilings in buildings that spring up like weeds after rain. But its the animals that make this place. Folk come here for the stark beauty but stay for what lives in it. The desert's got its own rules, its own kind of life that needs protecting. People ought to learn about whats here before they come barging in. My three young ones have taken to it like they was born to it, always out hunting lizards and desert bugs, their hands dirty with the searching.\n\nWe got our attractions too. The county fair comes round once a year, bringing noise and light to the quiet. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like some ancient thing waiting. The museum holds bones and artifacts, telling stories of what came before, when different folk walked these parts. But mostly its just the desert stretching out, patient and eternal, not caring much whether we stay or go.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland. Dormitories rise up from the earth like ancient monoliths, their windows dead and dark in the failing light. He considers this place his neighborhood though he knows it aint like other men's neighborhoods. No. This here's different.\n\nThree kinds of dwellings stand sentinel in this concrete valley. The apartments first, stacked like burial chambers two floors high, twenty souls or thereabouts contained within their walls. Then the houses proper, scattered few and far between, where the older ones dwell. Alumni they call them, though that word means little now in this godless place. Last come the dormitories themselves, great concrete beasts swallowing hundreds of young lives whole, two to a cell like prisoners waiting out their sentence.\n\nThe people here come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds thrown together in this stone garden like leaves in a dead autumn wind. Professional folk claim the houses while the young ones, green as spring corn, huddle in their dormitory caves. The older students take to the apartments like wounded animals seeking shelter, marking time until their own exodus comes.\n\nStores line the concrete arteries like the last outposts of some fallen civilization. Food halls where young bodies gather to feed. Clothing shops bearing the mark of the institution like some tribal totem. A single park remains, an oasis in this academic desert, kept clean by unspoken law and communal vigilance. Everything a body might need contained within these borders, he thinks. Everything and nothing.\n\nHe watches them move through this strange country, these pilgrims of knowledge, their backpacks like the burdens of ancient wanderers. Each one carrying their own history, their own destiny. Each one both stranger and kin in this place that aint quite a home but aint quite not neither. The sun sets behind the library's towering spire, casting long shadows across the quad like prison bars, and he knows that this here's his neighborhood now, for better or worse, until the time comes to move on.",
            "Aint no sidewalks here. Everything runs down and away like water in a drain and the house sits alone atop the highest rise where folk come to test their legs against the slope. They call it the workout hill though there aint nothing organized about it. Just people running up and down like blood through veins. No path but the road itself, pocked and scarred like an old mans face. Above the power lines hang in disarray, patched and mended from countless storms, a patchwork of copper and steel that tells its own history of wind and rain.\n\nThe trees stand like dark sentinels. Evergreens thick as night but the people here hate them. Take axe and saw to them whenever they can, wanting nothing between their eyes and the water below. Houses rise up proud and gleaming, glass faces turned toward the bay like worshipers. When the sun sets the water burns orange beneath the clouds that hover permanent as death. Most days the world is gray and wet. Moss claims everything that dont move and some things that do. Left my truck sitting one month and found it turned to green velvet, took half a day to scrape the life from its metal skin.\n\nChildren are scarce as sunshine though theres a school nearby. Old folk mostly, retired and waiting. Dogs run the streets like they own them. Bold as thieves theyll come right in your house if you leave a door standing open. Found one in my parlor once, staring at me like I was the intruder. Rabbits too, big as cats sometimes, digging up the earth like tiny gravediggers. My cats hunt them though, keeping nature in its proper balance. Birds wheel overhead, little ones and sometimes the great raptors until the crows drive them off like black-winged sheriffs.\n\nNo stores to speak of but down by the water where the land gives way to stone you can find places that serve up what the bay provides. The shore aint much for swimming but the rocks make good missiles to throw at the gray water. The far shore sits quiet through the mist, close enough to see but far enough to keep its secrets. Just water and stone and sky, same as its always been.",
            "The streets of Bensonhurst lay before him like some great concrete labyrinth, the subway trains rumbling deep beneath the earth like ancient beasts. He walked these streets as countless others had before him, the new world rising up from the bones of the old. Asian storefront signs hung stark against the gray buildings, their neon characters bleeding into the morning mist.\n\nEvery block held another market or laundromat, testament to the changing tides of humanity that washed through these streets year after year. The markets stood shoulder to shoulder, four within two minutes walking, their shelves stocked with strange fruits and dried things in jars that caught the light like creatures preserved in formaldehyde. The prices were good. The food fresh. The people came.\n\nHe thought about how the neighborhood had changed. Waves of immigrants washing up on these shores like tidewrack, each generation laying claim to their small piece of the world. Their children speaking a new tongue, American born but carrying the old world in their blood.\n\nThe park stood renovated, pristine. Basketball courts stretched out like graves, ten in all. Soccer fields and baseball diamonds where children played in the dying light. Water fountains spraying their benediction in summer heat. All of them there together, different colors, different tongues, but children just the same.\n\nAt night the streets changed. Music thundered from passing cars like war drums, engines screaming into the darkness. The thieves came too, taking what wasnt theirs, leaving their mark like animals marking territory. Violence lurked in doorways and alleyways, senseless and brutal as nature itself.\n\nHe'd seen it himself years ago, felt fists against flesh, tasted blood. The neighborhood was safer now but still held danger in its shadows. Even the simple act of receiving packages had become a kind of warfare, boxes disappearing from doorsteps like prey snatched by unseen predators.\n\nAnd everywhere the dog shit lay like landmines on the sidewalk, despite signs and fines and civilized intentions. Each morning brought new deposits, fresh evidence of mans disregard for his fellow man. He watched his step carefully, threading his way through the minefield of human indifference, carrying the weight of all he'd seen in this place that was both heaven and hell, sanctuary and prison, home and exile all at once.",
            "You have to know what weird means here in Portland Oregon and know it well. Like some dark prophecy written on brick and mortar behind a place that serves pizza and drink and flesh and song, all of it skirting the edges of what men call legal. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk say it's a remembrance of older days when the city was cheaper and unknown and bred strange cultures in its belly like some great beast. Others hear it like a calling, come here where your strangeness aint strange no more but something folk smile upon.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their steel and glass towers rising up like teeth from the earth but the weird remains. Not that weird means welcome to all things but it welcomes what other places cast out. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere else in this tired world. Weird aint the opposite of normal cause we got that too. Got our yoga folk and our coffee drinkers in pressed shirts but maybe we just dont hold so tight to the pretending that comes with it all.\n\nWhere I lay my head the houses stand painted like fever dreams. Gardens grow wild along the streets, herbs and flowers tangled together like lovers. Come summer the free boxes appear. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic. Like gifts from some nameless god, they hold treasures meant for whoever passes by. Clothes mostly. Books. But sometimes other things. Things you never knew you needed till you saw them there in the box.\n\nThe magic of these streets is what Portland means to me though Im just one kind of strange in an ocean of strange. Some wouldnt touch those sidewalk offerings. They do their bending with goats or scream at men kicking balls in green jerseys. All kinds here. Dreamers and failed dreamers drinking away the memory of dreams in dark bars.\n\nThe drugs are here too. Always are where minds break under gray skies and endless rain. Got our homeless too, drawn by what little help we give though its never enough. Never is anywhere. The rest of us shift between pity and rage like weather. In that we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. North they stretch like ancient gods bearing witness to each dawn and dusk that passes over this land. A man might forget them in the mundane sufferings of his days but they remain. Unmoving. Unchanging. When the darkness of mind comes heavy upon you they call out with their silence and their strength flows into your bones like water into parched earth. One day following another until the days lose count.\n\nI came here young. A boy really. The university stretched out below them mountains that stood watch over all like sentinels of stone. The campus had its own beauty right enough. Old buildings and trees and pools of water that caught the sky in their depths but it was them mountains that owned my soul complete.\n\nThe town lay scattered below like bones bleached in the sun. Little cafes where students sat hunched over books and computers drinking bitter coffee till their hands shook. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks faded to colors you couldn't name. For them few blocks it was like some bigger place. Some city where people moved quick and talked loud but it didn't last. Past the library the quiet came back like it had never left.\n\nStrange how a place can hold both peace and pain in equal measure. I seen both there. Walked with friends past playground swings gone to rust. Ran through them downtown streets to catch some picture show in a theater too fine for the likes of us. But I seen darker things too. Sat by them ponds at night watching creatures go about their business while my mind wandered down paths best left untrod. Wondering what purpose God or the devil had in mind when he put me here.\n\nSometimes I'd walk. Past the pond and the park and them little houses all lined up neat like children waiting to be counted. Till I hit the main road where palm trees caught the morning sun like fire. And looking north there they'd be. Them mountains touching the sky like they always had and always would. Speaking without words about carrying on. About persevering. About enduring like stone.",
            "You wouldnt see it at first. Not with them strip malls and empty stores standing like sentinels against the gray sky. Behind the old Whole Foods that aint whole no more and past them hotels where folk only come in summer when the air hangs thick like molasses, theres life. Real life.\n\nStreets wind back there like veins in a corpse. Apartment buildings stood shoulder to shoulder like old soldiers, each one darker than the last. First ones got trouble in em. Bad trouble that makes the news but we dont speak on that. Evil finds its way everywhere. But them other buildings, three of em standing there like brothers, they was different. Across the road the community college squatted low, quiet-like, where sleepy students drift in carrying their coffee cups like holy things. Iron gates screech their morning song while cars stack up behind em, drivers cursing the day.\n\nRoad ends at a T, park on one side where broken folk go to mend their bones. They got chairs out front where the ceiling fan turns slow, pushing the thick air round and round like God stirring soup. Children run wild in the grass across the way, their bodies writing stories in the air while bees dance drunk in the flowers. Old folk walking dogs eye the skateboard kids like they was carrying plague. Young girls gather like crows by the playground equipment, talking bout things that dont matter none.\n\nStrip mall stands guard over it all. Sushi place never has no customers but stays open like its waiting for something. Swimming store. Nail shop. All of em lined up neat like teeth in a skull. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish. Them teenagers from the park get their frozen sugar and their nicotine clouds, thinking they invented being young.\n\nThis here's a piece of something old. Something that dont change much. Time moves different here, like molasses in winter, thick and slow and dark. The south holding onto its ghosts, keeping em close like precious things.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in the quiet streets. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins sharing organs neither could live without. Small yards stretched before them and narrow driveways ran alongside like dried-up creek beds. They were monuments to some American notion that had taken root in the hearts of men and flowered brief and violent before withering away leaving only these husks behind. Yet they endured. Silent testimony to what once was and what might yet be again.\n\nThe people moved about their days like sleepwalkers. Yards unkempt now where once they'd been manicured like cemetery plots. But automobiles still occupied the drives two by two like animals come to some concrete ark and children played in the streets as if the world ended at the town limits. The old school building rose up from the earth like some ancient pueblo dwelling. Ninety years of hopes and dreams etched into its weathered walls. Churches stood empty save for dust and memories but the basketball courts thrummed with life like the beating heart of some great beast.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years. The market run by the Yemen family stood like an outpost in a foreign land, Arabs among blacks, all of them carrying stories of better days when neighbor knew neighbor and children played without fear. Where the karate school once stood now stood a pharmacy dispensing chemical dreams to replace the celluloid ones that had died with the last kung fu movie. The theatre remained, showing fragments of the past to gray heads who remembered when pictures moved slower and cost less.\n\nThe expressway passed through like a river of steel and concrete but gave no sustenance to the town. The old ones had seen to that, turning away the exit ramps like biblical plagues that would destroy their eden. Now they built a new school while arguing over totems and symbols as if choosing right might keep the future at bay. But the future came anyway, seeping in through the cracks like the ash-gray dawn of another day.",
            "The city stretches out endless and gray. Buildings rise like ancient monoliths from the cracked earth, some tall as mountains, others squatting low against the ground like creatures waiting to die. Between them the streets run like dried riverbeds, choked with machines that crawl forward and stop and crawl forward again in their mindless procession.\n\nHe walked the streets where the storefronts pressed against one another, names in different tongues marking their territories. Korean letters. Chinese symbols. Armenian script that looked like the marks of birds in wet sand. The people moved past him like ghosts, their eyes never meeting his, each sealed away in their own private darkness.\n\nThe parks stood as islands in the concrete waste. Children played there still, their voices carrying across the dead grass while their minders watched from wooden benches worn smooth by countless others before them. Jews in their black coats. The queer folk with their bright colors. The Russians speaking their harsh tongue. All of them together yet apart, like creatures sharing the same cage but separated by invisible walls.\n\nAt night the roads filled with red lights stretching to the horizon. Two hours to travel ten miles. The machines idling in their endless migration. No one walked anymore. They'd forgotten how, like fish forgetting to swim. New towers rose everywhere, steel bones reaching toward a sky they'd never touch. The people who lived in the old places watched them rise and shook their heads and muttered about the newcomers who'd come to fill them.\n\nHe remembered when things were different. Playing in the street with the boy next door, their mothers watching from windows now dark and empty. But that was long ago. Now the neighbors were strangers, their faces blank as courthouse walls, their names unknown and unknowable. The community had died but no one had bothered to bury it. It just went on existing, like everything else in this place, neither alive nor dead but somewhere in between.",
            "She looked out at the endless rows of corn stretching toward the dimming horizon and asked where everything was. This is it, I told her. She'd never known such emptiness, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The fields stretched out before us like some biblical wasteland, stalks bent and swaying in the wind that swept eternal across the Ohio plains.\n\nWe drove on down a road no wider than two cars might pass. Beyond the quarry water black as oil lay the development where I lived. Houses of brick and stucco rose up from half-acre plots tended with a devotion bordering on violence. Spring brought forth flowers planted with mechanical precision alongside trees that died and were reborn with each turning of the seasons. Mercedes automobiles gleamed in driveways like chrome coffins catching the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. Ancient now but still he rode his mower like some pagan god of suburban order, singing songs in a tongue none understood. Doctor once, they said. Now just another ghost drifting across the manufactured grass, John Deere his mechanical familiar.\n\nOur house stood grey and stark against the sky. Geese moved through the side yard like pale wraiths while the terrier gave chase, all fury and purpose. A stream whispered past carrying secrets to the quarry. Bullfrogs sang their throaty hymns while cattle lowed in distant fields like mourners at a wake. Past the bridge we'd built lay wilderness untamed. Trees and herbs and flowers that grew by no man's leave. This was my kingdom in younger days. Built forts in those trees like shelter against the coming dark. Hunted phantoms through the woods with neighborhood children who've long since vanished into memory.\n\nWinter came cruel as judgment. The yard transformed from verdant life to barren waste. Trees that once blazed with color stood skeletal and bare against the leaden sky. Snow fell like ash from heaven, turning all to white desolation. My sister's angels pressed into the drifts like fossil records of innocence. We warred with snowballs hurled from fortresses of ice and stick, playing at destruction in our private universe where nothing existed beyond the moment. Just children then, before the world revealed its teeth."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Small town Michigan where the farmland bleeds into tourist towns like blood seeping through gauze. Aint no malls here. No Walmart. No chain restaurants with their neon signs burning holes in the night. Everything's a drive. But Lord if it aint beautiful, this water-blessed land. My piece of earth sits between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix like a child between two vast mothers. Water everywhere you turn. Always some shore waiting to swallow your feet.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks of small places, of lives lived close to the ground. Houses stand apart from each other like stubborn old men, each one different, each one carrying its years in its own way. Some got new faces, others wear their age plain. Most got basements you can see from the road, like bones showing through worn skin. Aluminum siding gone gray and weary on many. Colors everywhere though, like God himself couldn't make up his mind.\n\nYards stretch out wild and lived-in. Trampolines standing like black metal insects. Garden plots where folks work the earth with their hands. Fences holding dogs and memories. These houses, they hold Middle America. Working folk who wake up tired and go to bed tired and somewhere in between raise up their young.\n\nChildren run these streets like water. Dogs and bikes and roller skates. Neighbors know each other's shadows. They can smell a stranger. Folk grilling in their yards raise a hand to passersby, dog walkers nod like old friends. The grass stays cut, the bushes trimmed, leaves dont linger come autumn. Aint beautiful like them magazine neighborhoods, but its good. Safe. The kind of place where you can lay your head down at night and know your children sleep easy.\n\nSheriff's office sits close enough to walk to. Health department too. Recycling center down the way where trucks come and go like mechanical pilgrims. Baseball fields echo with voices calling names into the evening air. Small planes growl overhead from the town airport, their engines speaking in tongues only pilots know. Ice cream place is walking distance. Downtown too if your legs are willing. Children can ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through these quiet streets where everyone knows everyone and the water's always waiting at the edge of town.\n\nThis is my place. This is where we are.",
            "The houses stood like grave markers in that suburban waste. Row after row of them identical and mute beneath the scorching sun. No character to speak of save what the homeowners association deemed fit in their godless pursuit of uniformity. Each yard a mirror of the last. Small patches of grass maintained with religious fervor and decorative stone scattered like the bones of some ancient thing and driveways too short for any proper use. Trees stood dwarfed and regulated, testimony to man's desire to control even nature herself.\n\nThe concrete roads stretched pristine and perfect through the development, unmarred by time or wear as if laid down yesterday though they weren't. No mailboxes stood sentry before the homes like in times past. Instead they'd built communal boxes at the street's end, all locked away behind cold metal doors with two larger chambers for packages, as if the very act of mail delivery needed to be sanitized and controlled.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the city's edge where suburbia met the wild lands in an uneasy truce. They'd built pools there, gated and watched, and walking trails that wound through what remained of the natural world. Retired folk mostly inhabited these parts now, with some younger professionals mixed in like pepper in salt. They watched each other with practiced vigilance, each serving as the other's keeper in this manufactured paradise.\n\nThe city itself sprawled vast but retained something of its small-town heart, like a child trying on its father's clothes. One mall stood testament to progress, neither grand nor humble but sufficient to its purpose. Fifteen minutes drive in any direction would take you to the temples of commerce - stores high and low, from the organic sanctuaries of the wealthy to the bare-bones outlets where the poor sought sustenance.\n\nThe whole of it lay there beneath the empty sky, safe and maintained and typical as a dream. A place where even chaos had been ordered into submission, where wildness had been tamed and packaged for consumption. Where you could drive your car to any chain store your heart desired, so long as you were willing to trade fifteen minutes of your life to get there.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the missing. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more each month to inhabit and none had spoken of such tales before. Not my companions nor any other soul. Perhaps it's the weight of living that silences them. Some nights you can hear them weeping through the walls, my friends, crushed under the burden of survival. Time teaches you to live lean. You learn to love the scent of secondhand things, those castoff toys and clothes wrapped in time's shroud. The nose grows dull with age. Some take to tobacco. Others just forget what clean truly meant.\n\nBut the markets of the poor persist. They smell of adulthood itself, like magazines gone yellow atop a piano that ain't been opened in years. The smell works its way into leather and stays, defying soap and water both. Three such stores stand within walking distance. Starting from the far end you can make your pilgrimage through two charity shops, past the library, through a place that trades in rare books, ending at the curiosity shop. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but them shops stay quiet as tombs. Silent sanctuaries where afternoon light dies slow.\n\nYear by year the city grows fat with cars and bodies. They call it development. Some great digital empire made its throne here, and the city groans with growing pains like New York before it. Everyone carries their own purpose here, asks nothing of nobody. A man can wrap himself in solitude and none will try to pierce that shell. Not like down South where concern passes for caring. Here the city breaks against you like waves on stone and recedes just the same.\n\nLife moves through the walls. A pianist dwells next door, two would-be singers above. Less strangers sharing walls than a fellowship of sorts. We come together in need, mark births and deaths alike, extend help when we can. Fortune smiled on me in this. My neighbors treat me kindly and I do the same. I mind my mess and share my food and they return the gesture. We pass letters between us like sacred things. I've made my home in this concrete labyrinth but it's them that makes it bearable. Makes me think I ain't ruined everything after all.",
            "The town lies just beyond the reach of the city, a small midwestern place where the wind carries stories of better days. On the east side where we dwell the houses stand weathered and wanting, their paint peeling like old scabs, rented or bought by those who carry little in their pockets save hope and copper pennies. But there aint no ugliness here. The people nod and speak when you pass. They remember what courtesy means in a world that's forgotten.\n\nThe violence comes sometimes like a thief in the night. Gunshots echo in the darkness. People disappear. The neighbors lost their boy outside a bar last year, his blood soaking into cracked pavement while music played inside. We've been spared such grief save for the occasional taking of things left too long on the porch, like offerings to hungry ghosts.\n\nThe poison that men call fentanyl has worked its way through the veins of this town like a slow cancer. Bodies stack up in the morgue while the living learn to push needles of salvation into dying flesh. Narcan they call it. A resurrection in a bottle.\n\nThe boy goes to school where good people still work at being good. Special needs, they say, but he aint never been treated as less than whole. The teachers remember what kindness means. They feed all the children here, knowing hunger dont care about pride. Twenty percent below the poverty line, the numbers say, but numbers dont tell about the heart of things.\n\nThe city men work their improvements in the center of town and the west side where the money flows. Fresh pavement, new trees, parks where children play. But the east side waits like a forgotten child, watching its brothers get new shoes while its own feet stay bare.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint worth much in dollars but it keeps out the rain and holds our memories. The people here they get by. They remember what community means. Sometimes at night I stand on the porch and listen to the town breathing, all its broken dreams and stubborn hopes rising up like smoke from chimneys in winter. This is home. There aint no other place we'd rather be.",
            "The neighborhood set upon the hill like some ancient fortress, buildings standing sentinel with their histories etched deep in mortar and stone. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater stands dark and brooding, its marquee dead these many years. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather when the warmth comes, an arcade where beer flows and laughter echoes against brick walls. Lines of them standing patient in the summer dark, waiting their turn at whatever salvation lies within.\n\nThe park spreads vast above it all, ringed in concrete like the walls of some forgotten coliseum. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents lined neat as gravestones along the steps where the rain beats its endless dirge. They huddle close, these wanderers, seeking warmth in numbers, closer to where mercy flows from shower heads and soap dispensers in the family center down below.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks to me, nor them proud buildings reaching toward whatever god might still be watching. It's the people carrying their histories like scars. Hilltop, they called it, when blood ran in gutters and federal men swept through like locusts, badges glinting, taking what they would. Stories pass like scripture now, whispered in doorways, told to newcomers like me who came seeking something real.\n\nWhite folk dont walk these streets after dark, they say, though that warning rings hollow as an old church bell, echoing from days when fear ruled these blocks. Maybe its that my skin carries enough shadow to pass, or maybe the Hill sees in me what it sees in itself - the weight of old wounds, the knowing that fear and ignorance still poison the well we all drink from.\n\nThese streets know me now. They've sheltered me when rain fell like judgment. Seen me huddled against concrete while strangers passed carrying kindness like lanterns in the dark. Five dollars pressed into a cold palm, words of worth spoken soft as prayer. The Hill claims its own, and I am claimed, marked by this place where laundromat lights burn late for them that need charging, where jackets appear like miracles on cold shoulders.\n\nThis is home. These streets. These people. This history written in brick and blood and mercy. The Hill abides, and I abide with it.",
            "When I came to this place I was just a boy, not yet fourteen, the houses standing like sentinels in the dull August heat. Making friends dont come easy to a boy that age but there was two others lived close by, one two doors down and another somewhere along that same street. They're gone now but the memories aint. Most that was here then is here still. Houses like you'd see anywhere in this country, two stories high with vinyl siding gone gray in the weather, pressed together like old friends sharing secrets. Summer weekends you can hear the children, their voices carrying across yards gone brown in the heat, their laughter echoing off aluminum gutters and chain link fences.\n\nQuiet mostly. The kind of quiet that speaks to something deeper than just the absence of sound. Folk here mind their own unless there's need otherwise. Packages come and stay where they're left. Trust aint something you find easy these days but here it remains like some relic of an older time.\n\nThe park sits just beyond where the houses end. Basketball courts where the asphalt's cracked and weeds push through. Football fields where blood was spilled, my own once when some boy's elbow found my nose. But that aint what I remember most. What I remember is the good times, times that seem now like they belonged to someone else. These days I take my cousin's young ones there. Watch them on the swings, their legs pumping at the sky like they might touch it if they just try hard enough.\n\nThe streets here are a patchwork of cultures pressed together like pages in an old book. Chinese food and Mexican. Indian spices carrying on the wind. Italian too. Most folk now they just press buttons on their phones and food appears like magic at their doors. Fast food mostly, pizza too. All the stores a body could need. Cleaners where shirts hang like pale ghosts in windows. Drug stores facing each other across the street like gunslingers. Grocery stores with their fluorescent glow spilling onto empty parking lots at night. Even got an Indian store where spices sit in glass jars like jewels.\n\nWhen I hear tell of other places, neighborhoods where folk cant trust their own shadow, I know what we got here is something rare. Something worth holding onto. Like finding water in a desert, or truth in a world gone mad with lies.",
            "The college loomed beyond the treeline, a concrete sentinel watching over streets that held no memory of better days. The apartment buildings stood like weathered tombstones, their facades grayed and peeling in the filtered sunlight. Forty-second street lay before him like a promise, newly paved, the sidewalks clean and wide, but behind it forty-third crouched in shadow, its concrete broken and heaved up like the bones of something long dead.\n\nHe walked past the bars where students gathered, their laughter carrying across empty lots where weeds pushed through cracked asphalt. The new place charged more now, but they all did. Money was just paper anyway, worthless as the leaves that skittered across the fresh-laid sod between road and walk.\n\nThe air was thick with smoke. Not tobacco but that sweet cloying scent that seeped from beneath his neighbors' door. Management had mounted their plastic defense against it, a small box that wheezed out artificial spring. A joke if there ever was one.\n\nBehind the buildings the trees stood sentinel, their branches reaching like gnarled fingers over rooftops. Some had been cut, their stumps testament to man's constant war with nature. Beyond them lay forty-third street where the shadows grew longer and darker, where sirens wailed more often in the night. The buildings there wore their decay like a shroud, their windows staring blind and empty at passersby.\n\nThe new apartments down the way were false prophets, pretty shells built quick and cheap, drawing in the faithful with promises their thin walls couldn't keep. The restaurant across served microwaved dreams on paper plates, and the gas station's fluorescent lights cast their sickly glow over minimum wage desperation.\n\nBut it was home. The buses came and went like mechanical heartbeats, carrying their human cargo to and from the city's core. The university waited within walking distance, its presence both salvation and curse. He could afford to exist here, in this liminal space between prosperity and decay, where the trees still grew thick enough to hide whatever truths men wished to keep hidden.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, white porches hanging off them like bones, green metal roofs catching what light there was. Each built to mirror the other yet standing alone in their own right. Folk gathered some evenings in driveways unspoken and predetermined, their voices carrying across the settling dusk while young ones drew their chalk figures on the ground or sent their kites up into the darkening sky. Like some remembrance of times past, before the world grew cold with its screens and circuits.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up against a sky that carried clouds white as burial shrouds. But the weather turned mean. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark like some mechanical banshee and we all scattered to our holes. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever precious things I thought to save while the big one paced and barked at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles spilling across the earth.\n\nWhen it was done the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cold. Ninety-two degrees to seventy-five in the time it takes to draw breath. The ice melted where it fell on the burning pavement and then the sun broke through and the rain came with it. Twin rainbows rose up out of nothing like some biblical covenant. Took pictures with the camera though they couldn't capture what was there. The truth of it.\n\nThe streets stayed quiet a while longer till folk emerged from wherever they'd sheltered, like survivors of some great catastrophe. Then life resumed its rhythm. Women and children out while supper cooked inside. Northern girl gone south, I found myself taken by their slow sweet way of talking. My rooms different from my neighbors though the shells that held them looked the same from without. Some smaller than they had any right to be.\n\nI walk the field out back sometimes down to where the pond lies still and dark. Deer move through the morning mist and bullfrogs sound their ancient songs. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters call across the dawn from farms I cannot see and sometimes in the evening the donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding some lost coin in the dirt. Something precious that had been waiting there all along.",
            "Ten years in this place. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. When we first come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept like a child cause I was one. Mama and daddy said it was for the better. Better houses better schools. Less of what folk called ghetto though words like that dont mean much when youre leaving behind what you know.\n\nTime passed like it does. Made friends. Made enemies too. Neighbors stayed strange except for Mr Glen and Dennis living right aside us. Good folk. Like blood almost. I member Mr Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him getting hitched again and all of us there dancing. Ms Veda in her white dress throwing that little leg strap that I caught though the flowers passed me by. Danced with Marsharii that night. His daughter. Aint seen her since and sometimes I wonder where the wind took her.\n\nThe streets here wind like snakes in summer. Got myself a GPS now but back then it was all guesswork. Used to roam with Kason and Curtis. Playing them games and living like time would never catch us. Sometimes I'd take to the park. Still do. Something in the quiet there speaks truth. Carry sticks from the hardware store. Practice balance. Bring my wooden sword too sometimes. Just a man and his thoughts among the trees.\n\nCourts there too. Basketball and tennis both though I aint played neither in what feels like forever. Daddy and Mr Graves taught me and my friend the ways of tennis. Worked us till we could hardly stand but there was joy in it. Joy in all of it maybe.\n\nReckon theres more stories buried in these streets than I could tell. More yet to come too. Time dont stop its turning for no man but sometimes it gives you something worth holding onto. Sometimes thats enough.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, sprawled across South Carolina dirt, nothing special save for what grew from its soil. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World the sign said, standing stark against the sky like some proclamation of glory long past. Fields stretched out beyond sight, peach trees marching in endless rows like soldiers frozen in formation, and between them cattle grazed on whatever the hard earth would yield.\n\nHouses stood back from the road like shy children, most wearing metal crowns to ward off the merciless southern sun, others topped with shingles gray as tombstones. They didnt crowd together but kept their distance, each surrounded by its own kingdom of dirt and grass where man and beast sought their living.\n\nThe town proper wasnt much. One stoplight swaying in the wind where four roads met. Three places to quiet your hunger: Hong Kong where a single family worked their days away, Fiesta where Mexico lived in exile, and Garys where burgers died daily deaths. The pizza place was gone now. Just gone.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug still stood, known more for its cherry cola than any medicine it might dispense. The IGA market charged dear for its goods and most folks drove the long miles to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, their tires eating up the asphalt like hungry ghosts. But the Dollar General, that was different. From dawn till dusk it breathed people in and out like some great retail beast.\n\nPossibilities Furniture sat there with its two movers and its kind woman owner who everyone knew, and next door Clarks dealt in the grooming of pets, washing and cutting and watching over the animals folks couldn't keep at home. The doctors both for man and beast kept to themselves on the edge of things, small operations but enough for what the town required.\n\nOne school was all they had. After that the children went elsewhere, like seeds scattered by the wind. They were building something they called a park, two and a half acres of hope that might bring new life to the town, but for now there wasnt much. No picture shows, no bowling, no place for young folk to gather or children to play or dogs to run. But it was a town all the same, so small you might pass through it between one breath and the next, like a dream you cant quite remember when you wake.",
            "He lived there with his wife and the two girls, eleven and fourteen, in that southern place where two highways met. The street between them carried more traffic than a man might want but they'd grown used to its sounds like you grow used to the sound of your own breathing. The neighborhood stood quiet mostly. Folk didn't come and go much. They knew the faces and the vehicles that belonged and those that didn't belong stood out like strange dogs.\n\nThe house sat on the corner where they could watch it all. Watch the people doing what people do. Mowing grass and raking leaves and living out their days. In winter the children would take to sledding down the hill on the side street, their voices carrying through the cold air like birds. He and his worked from home and they lived their lives in full view of everyone else who lived there, playing even in the rain sometimes, grilling meat on the back deck where the smoke would rise up through the trees that had been there longer than any of them.\n\nFrom March clear through to October you could hear somebody's mower running somewhere. The neighborhood had been woods once and still kept its trees, kept its shade, kept its yearly tithe of leaves that needed burning when fall came. He liked that smell. Lately the winters had gone soft, like fall just stretched on forever without end.\n\nThe garage stood at the back and that's where they came and went mostly, front door silent as a tomb except for the rare stranger's knock. He'd work on his truck sometimes with the garage doors standing open, feeling the pulse of the neighborhood like a man feels his own heartbeat. Holidays brought the quiet broken by visiting kin, cars parked everywhere like bright beetles. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. All them days when families remember they're families.\n\nIt wasn't a bad place to live. If it weren't for that through street it might have been perfect. But perfect ain't for this world, he reckoned. Never was.",
            "The high desert stretches out before me like some vast and ancient thing. Dirt and more dirt. Brown upon brown. Unless you lived here you wouldnt know how it gets inside you, that endless brown, and when you see green its like finding money, knowing full well somebody's bleeding themselves dry to keep it. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart like survivors of some plague but now they're closing in. The city grows like a cancer but I reckon everywhere does these days.\n\nFolk here are mostly good but like anywhere theres darkness too. My patch is full of old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind their curtains. The stores are all chains, Food for Less and such, nothing special. You want better you got to drive. Construction runs through this place like a backbone, men building more houses in the empty spaces that shrink year by year. Makes me uneasy. Left the big city once and dont aim to live in another.\n\nI work the drywall myself, putting up walls and ceilings in buildings that spring up like weeds after rain. But its the animals that make this place. Folk come here for the stark beauty but stay for what lives in it. The desert's got its own rules, its own kind of life that needs protecting. People ought to learn about whats here before they come barging in. My three young ones have taken to it like they was born to it, always out hunting lizards and desert bugs, their hands dirty with the searching.\n\nWe got our attractions too. The county fair comes round once a year, bringing noise and light to the quiet. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like some ancient thing waiting. The museum holds bones and artifacts, telling stories of what came before, when different folk walked these parts. But mostly its just the desert stretching out, patient and eternal, not caring much whether we stay or go.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland. Dormitories rise up from the earth like ancient monoliths, their windows dead and dark in the failing light. He considers this place his neighborhood though he knows it aint like other men's neighborhoods. No. This here's different.\n\nThree kinds of dwellings stand sentinel in this concrete valley. The apartments first, stacked like burial chambers two floors high, twenty souls or thereabouts contained within their walls. Then the houses proper, scattered few and far between, where the older ones dwell. Alumni they call them, though that word means little now in this godless place. Last come the dormitories themselves, great concrete beasts swallowing hundreds of young lives whole, two to a cell like prisoners waiting out their sentence.\n\nThe people here come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds thrown together in this stone garden like leaves in a dead autumn wind. Professional folk claim the houses while the young ones, green as spring corn, huddle in their dormitory caves. The older students take to the apartments like wounded animals seeking shelter, marking time until their own exodus comes.\n\nStores line the concrete arteries like the last outposts of some fallen civilization. Food halls where young bodies gather to feed. Clothing shops bearing the mark of the institution like some tribal totem. A single park remains, an oasis in this academic desert, kept clean by unspoken law and communal vigilance. Everything a body might need contained within these borders, he thinks. Everything and nothing.\n\nHe watches them move through this strange country, these pilgrims of knowledge, their backpacks like the burdens of ancient wanderers. Each one carrying their own history, their own destiny. Each one both stranger and kin in this place that aint quite a home but aint quite not neither. The sun sets behind the library's towering spire, casting long shadows across the quad like prison bars, and he knows that this here's his neighborhood now, for better or worse, until the time comes to move on.",
            "Aint no sidewalks here. Everything runs down and away like water in a drain and the house sits alone atop the highest rise where folk come to test their legs against the slope. They call it the workout hill though there aint nothing organized about it. Just people running up and down like blood through veins. No path but the road itself, pocked and scarred like an old mans face. Above the power lines hang in disarray, patched and mended from countless storms, a patchwork of copper and steel that tells its own history of wind and rain.\n\nThe trees stand like dark sentinels. Evergreens thick as night but the people here hate them. Take axe and saw to them whenever they can, wanting nothing between their eyes and the water below. Houses rise up proud and gleaming, glass faces turned toward the bay like worshipers. When the sun sets the water burns orange beneath the clouds that hover permanent as death. Most days the world is gray and wet. Moss claims everything that dont move and some things that do. Left my truck sitting one month and found it turned to green velvet, took half a day to scrape the life from its metal skin.\n\nChildren are scarce as sunshine though theres a school nearby. Old folk mostly, retired and waiting. Dogs run the streets like they own them. Bold as thieves theyll come right in your house if you leave a door standing open. Found one in my parlor once, staring at me like I was the intruder. Rabbits too, big as cats sometimes, digging up the earth like tiny gravediggers. My cats hunt them though, keeping nature in its proper balance. Birds wheel overhead, little ones and sometimes the great raptors until the crows drive them off like black-winged sheriffs.\n\nNo stores to speak of but down by the water where the land gives way to stone you can find places that serve up what the bay provides. The shore aint much for swimming but the rocks make good missiles to throw at the gray water. The far shore sits quiet through the mist, close enough to see but far enough to keep its secrets. Just water and stone and sky, same as its always been.",
            "The streets of Bensonhurst lay before him like some great concrete labyrinth, the subway trains rumbling deep beneath the earth like ancient beasts. He walked these streets as countless others had before him, the new world rising up from the bones of the old. Asian storefront signs hung stark against the gray buildings, their neon characters bleeding into the morning mist.\n\nEvery block held another market or laundromat, testament to the changing tides of humanity that washed through these streets year after year. The markets stood shoulder to shoulder, four within two minutes walking, their shelves stocked with strange fruits and dried things in jars that caught the light like creatures preserved in formaldehyde. The prices were good. The food fresh. The people came.\n\nHe thought about how the neighborhood had changed. Waves of immigrants washing up on these shores like tidewrack, each generation laying claim to their small piece of the world. Their children speaking a new tongue, American born but carrying the old world in their blood.\n\nThe park stood renovated, pristine. Basketball courts stretched out like graves, ten in all. Soccer fields and baseball diamonds where children played in the dying light. Water fountains spraying their benediction in summer heat. All of them there together, different colors, different tongues, but children just the same.\n\nAt night the streets changed. Music thundered from passing cars like war drums, engines screaming into the darkness. The thieves came too, taking what wasnt theirs, leaving their mark like animals marking territory. Violence lurked in doorways and alleyways, senseless and brutal as nature itself.\n\nHe'd seen it himself years ago, felt fists against flesh, tasted blood. The neighborhood was safer now but still held danger in its shadows. Even the simple act of receiving packages had become a kind of warfare, boxes disappearing from doorsteps like prey snatched by unseen predators.\n\nAnd everywhere the dog shit lay like landmines on the sidewalk, despite signs and fines and civilized intentions. Each morning brought new deposits, fresh evidence of mans disregard for his fellow man. He watched his step carefully, threading his way through the minefield of human indifference, carrying the weight of all he'd seen in this place that was both heaven and hell, sanctuary and prison, home and exile all at once.",
            "You have to know what weird means here in Portland Oregon and know it well. Like some dark prophecy written on brick and mortar behind a place that serves pizza and drink and flesh and song, all of it skirting the edges of what men call legal. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk say it's a remembrance of older days when the city was cheaper and unknown and bred strange cultures in its belly like some great beast. Others hear it like a calling, come here where your strangeness aint strange no more but something folk smile upon.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their steel and glass towers rising up like teeth from the earth but the weird remains. Not that weird means welcome to all things but it welcomes what other places cast out. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere else in this tired world. Weird aint the opposite of normal cause we got that too. Got our yoga folk and our coffee drinkers in pressed shirts but maybe we just dont hold so tight to the pretending that comes with it all.\n\nWhere I lay my head the houses stand painted like fever dreams. Gardens grow wild along the streets, herbs and flowers tangled together like lovers. Come summer the free boxes appear. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic. Like gifts from some nameless god, they hold treasures meant for whoever passes by. Clothes mostly. Books. But sometimes other things. Things you never knew you needed till you saw them there in the box.\n\nThe magic of these streets is what Portland means to me though Im just one kind of strange in an ocean of strange. Some wouldnt touch those sidewalk offerings. They do their bending with goats or scream at men kicking balls in green jerseys. All kinds here. Dreamers and failed dreamers drinking away the memory of dreams in dark bars.\n\nThe drugs are here too. Always are where minds break under gray skies and endless rain. Got our homeless too, drawn by what little help we give though its never enough. Never is anywhere. The rest of us shift between pity and rage like weather. In that we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. North they stretch like ancient gods bearing witness to each dawn and dusk that passes over this land. A man might forget them in the mundane sufferings of his days but they remain. Unmoving. Unchanging. When the darkness of mind comes heavy upon you they call out with their silence and their strength flows into your bones like water into parched earth. One day following another until the days lose count.\n\nI came here young. A boy really. The university stretched out below them mountains that stood watch over all like sentinels of stone. The campus had its own beauty right enough. Old buildings and trees and pools of water that caught the sky in their depths but it was them mountains that owned my soul complete.\n\nThe town lay scattered below like bones bleached in the sun. Little cafes where students sat hunched over books and computers drinking bitter coffee till their hands shook. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks faded to colors you couldn't name. For them few blocks it was like some bigger place. Some city where people moved quick and talked loud but it didn't last. Past the library the quiet came back like it had never left.\n\nStrange how a place can hold both peace and pain in equal measure. I seen both there. Walked with friends past playground swings gone to rust. Ran through them downtown streets to catch some picture show in a theater too fine for the likes of us. But I seen darker things too. Sat by them ponds at night watching creatures go about their business while my mind wandered down paths best left untrod. Wondering what purpose God or the devil had in mind when he put me here.\n\nSometimes I'd walk. Past the pond and the park and them little houses all lined up neat like children waiting to be counted. Till I hit the main road where palm trees caught the morning sun like fire. And looking north there they'd be. Them mountains touching the sky like they always had and always would. Speaking without words about carrying on. About persevering. About enduring like stone.",
            "You wouldnt see it at first. Not with them strip malls and empty stores standing like sentinels against the gray sky. Behind the old Whole Foods that aint whole no more and past them hotels where folk only come in summer when the air hangs thick like molasses, theres life. Real life.\n\nStreets wind back there like veins in a corpse. Apartment buildings stood shoulder to shoulder like old soldiers, each one darker than the last. First ones got trouble in em. Bad trouble that makes the news but we dont speak on that. Evil finds its way everywhere. But them other buildings, three of em standing there like brothers, they was different. Across the road the community college squatted low, quiet-like, where sleepy students drift in carrying their coffee cups like holy things. Iron gates screech their morning song while cars stack up behind em, drivers cursing the day.\n\nRoad ends at a T, park on one side where broken folk go to mend their bones. They got chairs out front where the ceiling fan turns slow, pushing the thick air round and round like God stirring soup. Children run wild in the grass across the way, their bodies writing stories in the air while bees dance drunk in the flowers. Old folk walking dogs eye the skateboard kids like they was carrying plague. Young girls gather like crows by the playground equipment, talking bout things that dont matter none.\n\nStrip mall stands guard over it all. Sushi place never has no customers but stays open like its waiting for something. Swimming store. Nail shop. All of em lined up neat like teeth in a skull. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish. Them teenagers from the park get their frozen sugar and their nicotine clouds, thinking they invented being young.\n\nThis here's a piece of something old. Something that dont change much. Time moves different here, like molasses in winter, thick and slow and dark. The south holding onto its ghosts, keeping em close like precious things.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in the quiet streets. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins sharing organs neither could live without. Small yards stretched before them and narrow driveways ran alongside like dried-up creek beds. They were monuments to some American notion that had taken root in the hearts of men and flowered brief and violent before withering away leaving only these husks behind. Yet they endured. Silent testimony to what once was and what might yet be again.\n\nThe people moved about their days like sleepwalkers. Yards unkempt now where once they'd been manicured like cemetery plots. But automobiles still occupied the drives two by two like animals come to some concrete ark and children played in the streets as if the world ended at the town limits. The old school building rose up from the earth like some ancient pueblo dwelling. Ninety years of hopes and dreams etched into its weathered walls. Churches stood empty save for dust and memories but the basketball courts thrummed with life like the beating heart of some great beast.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years. The market run by the Yemen family stood like an outpost in a foreign land, Arabs among blacks, all of them carrying stories of better days when neighbor knew neighbor and children played without fear. Where the karate school once stood now stood a pharmacy dispensing chemical dreams to replace the celluloid ones that had died with the last kung fu movie. The theatre remained, showing fragments of the past to gray heads who remembered when pictures moved slower and cost less.\n\nThe expressway passed through like a river of steel and concrete but gave no sustenance to the town. The old ones had seen to that, turning away the exit ramps like biblical plagues that would destroy their eden. Now they built a new school while arguing over totems and symbols as if choosing right might keep the future at bay. But the future came anyway, seeping in through the cracks like the ash-gray dawn of another day.",
            "The city stretches out endless and gray. Buildings rise like ancient monoliths from the cracked earth, some tall as mountains, others squatting low against the ground like creatures waiting to die. Between them the streets run like dried riverbeds, choked with machines that crawl forward and stop and crawl forward again in their mindless procession.\n\nHe walked the streets where the storefronts pressed against one another, names in different tongues marking their territories. Korean letters. Chinese symbols. Armenian script that looked like the marks of birds in wet sand. The people moved past him like ghosts, their eyes never meeting his, each sealed away in their own private darkness.\n\nThe parks stood as islands in the concrete waste. Children played there still, their voices carrying across the dead grass while their minders watched from wooden benches worn smooth by countless others before them. Jews in their black coats. The queer folk with their bright colors. The Russians speaking their harsh tongue. All of them together yet apart, like creatures sharing the same cage but separated by invisible walls.\n\nAt night the roads filled with red lights stretching to the horizon. Two hours to travel ten miles. The machines idling in their endless migration. No one walked anymore. They'd forgotten how, like fish forgetting to swim. New towers rose everywhere, steel bones reaching toward a sky they'd never touch. The people who lived in the old places watched them rise and shook their heads and muttered about the newcomers who'd come to fill them.\n\nHe remembered when things were different. Playing in the street with the boy next door, their mothers watching from windows now dark and empty. But that was long ago. Now the neighbors were strangers, their faces blank as courthouse walls, their names unknown and unknowable. The community had died but no one had bothered to bury it. It just went on existing, like everything else in this place, neither alive nor dead but somewhere in between.",
            "She looked out at the endless rows of corn stretching toward the dimming horizon and asked where everything was. This is it, I told her. She'd never known such emptiness, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The fields stretched out before us like some biblical wasteland, stalks bent and swaying in the wind that swept eternal across the Ohio plains.\n\nWe drove on down a road no wider than two cars might pass. Beyond the quarry water black as oil lay the development where I lived. Houses of brick and stucco rose up from half-acre plots tended with a devotion bordering on violence. Spring brought forth flowers planted with mechanical precision alongside trees that died and were reborn with each turning of the seasons. Mercedes automobiles gleamed in driveways like chrome coffins catching the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. Ancient now but still he rode his mower like some pagan god of suburban order, singing songs in a tongue none understood. Doctor once, they said. Now just another ghost drifting across the manufactured grass, John Deere his mechanical familiar.\n\nOur house stood grey and stark against the sky. Geese moved through the side yard like pale wraiths while the terrier gave chase, all fury and purpose. A stream whispered past carrying secrets to the quarry. Bullfrogs sang their throaty hymns while cattle lowed in distant fields like mourners at a wake. Past the bridge we'd built lay wilderness untamed. Trees and herbs and flowers that grew by no man's leave. This was my kingdom in younger days. Built forts in those trees like shelter against the coming dark. Hunted phantoms through the woods with neighborhood children who've long since vanished into memory.\n\nWinter came cruel as judgment. The yard transformed from verdant life to barren waste. Trees that once blazed with color stood skeletal and bare against the leaden sky. Snow fell like ash from heaven, turning all to white desolation. My sister's angels pressed into the drifts like fossil records of innocence. We warred with snowballs hurled from fortresses of ice and stick, playing at destruction in our private universe where nothing existed beyond the moment. Just children then, before the world revealed its teeth."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This here's Rural America. Small town Michigan where the farmland bleeds into tourist towns like blood seeping through gauze. Aint no malls here. No Walmart. No chain restaurants with their neon signs burning holes in the night. Everything's a drive. But Lord if it aint beautiful, this water-blessed land. My piece of earth sits between Lake Michigan and Lake Charlevoix like a child between two vast mothers. Water everywhere you turn. Always some shore waiting to swallow your feet.\n\nThe neighborhood speaks of small places, of lives lived close to the ground. Houses stand apart from each other like stubborn old men, each one different, each one carrying its years in its own way. Some got new faces, others wear their age plain. Most got basements you can see from the road, like bones showing through worn skin. Aluminum siding gone gray and weary on many. Colors everywhere though, like God himself couldn't make up his mind.\n\nYards stretch out wild and lived-in. Trampolines standing like black metal insects. Garden plots where folks work the earth with their hands. Fences holding dogs and memories. These houses, they hold Middle America. Working folk who wake up tired and go to bed tired and somewhere in between raise up their young.\n\nChildren run these streets like water. Dogs and bikes and roller skates. Neighbors know each other's shadows. They can smell a stranger. Folk grilling in their yards raise a hand to passersby, dog walkers nod like old friends. The grass stays cut, the bushes trimmed, leaves dont linger come autumn. Aint beautiful like them magazine neighborhoods, but its good. Safe. The kind of place where you can lay your head down at night and know your children sleep easy.\n\nSheriff's office sits close enough to walk to. Health department too. Recycling center down the way where trucks come and go like mechanical pilgrims. Baseball fields echo with voices calling names into the evening air. Small planes growl overhead from the town airport, their engines speaking in tongues only pilots know. Ice cream place is walking distance. Downtown too if your legs are willing. Children can ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through these quiet streets where everyone knows everyone and the water's always waiting at the edge of town.\n\nThis is my place. This is where we are.",
            "The houses stood like grave markers in that suburban waste. Row after row of them identical and mute beneath the scorching sun. No character to speak of save what the homeowners association deemed fit in their godless pursuit of uniformity. Each yard a mirror of the last. Small patches of grass maintained with religious fervor and decorative stone scattered like the bones of some ancient thing and driveways too short for any proper use. Trees stood dwarfed and regulated, testimony to man's desire to control even nature herself.\n\nThe concrete roads stretched pristine and perfect through the development, unmarred by time or wear as if laid down yesterday though they weren't. No mailboxes stood sentry before the homes like in times past. Instead they'd built communal boxes at the street's end, all locked away behind cold metal doors with two larger chambers for packages, as if the very act of mail delivery needed to be sanitized and controlled.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the city's edge where suburbia met the wild lands in an uneasy truce. They'd built pools there, gated and watched, and walking trails that wound through what remained of the natural world. Retired folk mostly inhabited these parts now, with some younger professionals mixed in like pepper in salt. They watched each other with practiced vigilance, each serving as the other's keeper in this manufactured paradise.\n\nThe city itself sprawled vast but retained something of its small-town heart, like a child trying on its father's clothes. One mall stood testament to progress, neither grand nor humble but sufficient to its purpose. Fifteen minutes drive in any direction would take you to the temples of commerce - stores high and low, from the organic sanctuaries of the wealthy to the bare-bones outlets where the poor sought sustenance.\n\nThe whole of it lay there beneath the empty sky, safe and maintained and typical as a dream. A place where even chaos had been ordered into submission, where wildness had been tamed and packaged for consumption. Where you could drive your car to any chain store your heart desired, so long as you were willing to trade fifteen minutes of your life to get there.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the missing. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more each month to inhabit and none had spoken of such tales before. Not my companions nor any other soul. Perhaps it's the weight of living that silences them. Some nights you can hear them weeping through the walls, my friends, crushed under the burden of survival. Time teaches you to live lean. You learn to love the scent of secondhand things, those castoff toys and clothes wrapped in time's shroud. The nose grows dull with age. Some take to tobacco. Others just forget what clean truly meant.\n\nBut the markets of the poor persist. They smell of adulthood itself, like magazines gone yellow atop a piano that ain't been opened in years. The smell works its way into leather and stays, defying soap and water both. Three such stores stand within walking distance. Starting from the far end you can make your pilgrimage through two charity shops, past the library, through a place that trades in rare books, ending at the curiosity shop. Downtown swells with metal and flesh each morning but them shops stay quiet as tombs. Silent sanctuaries where afternoon light dies slow.\n\nYear by year the city grows fat with cars and bodies. They call it development. Some great digital empire made its throne here, and the city groans with growing pains like New York before it. Everyone carries their own purpose here, asks nothing of nobody. A man can wrap himself in solitude and none will try to pierce that shell. Not like down South where concern passes for caring. Here the city breaks against you like waves on stone and recedes just the same.\n\nLife moves through the walls. A pianist dwells next door, two would-be singers above. Less strangers sharing walls than a fellowship of sorts. We come together in need, mark births and deaths alike, extend help when we can. Fortune smiled on me in this. My neighbors treat me kindly and I do the same. I mind my mess and share my food and they return the gesture. We pass letters between us like sacred things. I've made my home in this concrete labyrinth but it's them that makes it bearable. Makes me think I ain't ruined everything after all.",
            "The town lies just beyond the reach of the city, a small midwestern place where the wind carries stories of better days. On the east side where we dwell the houses stand weathered and wanting, their paint peeling like old scabs, rented or bought by those who carry little in their pockets save hope and copper pennies. But there aint no ugliness here. The people nod and speak when you pass. They remember what courtesy means in a world that's forgotten.\n\nThe violence comes sometimes like a thief in the night. Gunshots echo in the darkness. People disappear. The neighbors lost their boy outside a bar last year, his blood soaking into cracked pavement while music played inside. We've been spared such grief save for the occasional taking of things left too long on the porch, like offerings to hungry ghosts.\n\nThe poison that men call fentanyl has worked its way through the veins of this town like a slow cancer. Bodies stack up in the morgue while the living learn to push needles of salvation into dying flesh. Narcan they call it. A resurrection in a bottle.\n\nThe boy goes to school where good people still work at being good. Special needs, they say, but he aint never been treated as less than whole. The teachers remember what kindness means. They feed all the children here, knowing hunger dont care about pride. Twenty percent below the poverty line, the numbers say, but numbers dont tell about the heart of things.\n\nThe city men work their improvements in the center of town and the west side where the money flows. Fresh pavement, new trees, parks where children play. But the east side waits like a forgotten child, watching its brothers get new shoes while its own feet stay bare.\n\nSixteen years we've lived here. The house aint worth much in dollars but it keeps out the rain and holds our memories. The people here they get by. They remember what community means. Sometimes at night I stand on the porch and listen to the town breathing, all its broken dreams and stubborn hopes rising up like smoke from chimneys in winter. This is home. There aint no other place we'd rather be.",
            "The neighborhood set upon the hill like some ancient fortress, buildings standing sentinel with their histories etched deep in mortar and stone. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater stands dark and brooding, its marquee dead these many years. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather when the warmth comes, an arcade where beer flows and laughter echoes against brick walls. Lines of them standing patient in the summer dark, waiting their turn at whatever salvation lies within.\n\nThe park spreads vast above it all, ringed in concrete like the walls of some forgotten coliseum. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents lined neat as gravestones along the steps where the rain beats its endless dirge. They huddle close, these wanderers, seeking warmth in numbers, closer to where mercy flows from shower heads and soap dispensers in the family center down below.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks to me, nor them proud buildings reaching toward whatever god might still be watching. It's the people carrying their histories like scars. Hilltop, they called it, when blood ran in gutters and federal men swept through like locusts, badges glinting, taking what they would. Stories pass like scripture now, whispered in doorways, told to newcomers like me who came seeking something real.\n\nWhite folk dont walk these streets after dark, they say, though that warning rings hollow as an old church bell, echoing from days when fear ruled these blocks. Maybe its that my skin carries enough shadow to pass, or maybe the Hill sees in me what it sees in itself - the weight of old wounds, the knowing that fear and ignorance still poison the well we all drink from.\n\nThese streets know me now. They've sheltered me when rain fell like judgment. Seen me huddled against concrete while strangers passed carrying kindness like lanterns in the dark. Five dollars pressed into a cold palm, words of worth spoken soft as prayer. The Hill claims its own, and I am claimed, marked by this place where laundromat lights burn late for them that need charging, where jackets appear like miracles on cold shoulders.\n\nThis is home. These streets. These people. This history written in brick and blood and mercy. The Hill abides, and I abide with it.",
            "When I came to this place I was just a boy, not yet fourteen, the houses standing like sentinels in the dull August heat. Making friends dont come easy to a boy that age but there was two others lived close by, one two doors down and another somewhere along that same street. They're gone now but the memories aint. Most that was here then is here still. Houses like you'd see anywhere in this country, two stories high with vinyl siding gone gray in the weather, pressed together like old friends sharing secrets. Summer weekends you can hear the children, their voices carrying across yards gone brown in the heat, their laughter echoing off aluminum gutters and chain link fences.\n\nQuiet mostly. The kind of quiet that speaks to something deeper than just the absence of sound. Folk here mind their own unless there's need otherwise. Packages come and stay where they're left. Trust aint something you find easy these days but here it remains like some relic of an older time.\n\nThe park sits just beyond where the houses end. Basketball courts where the asphalt's cracked and weeds push through. Football fields where blood was spilled, my own once when some boy's elbow found my nose. But that aint what I remember most. What I remember is the good times, times that seem now like they belonged to someone else. These days I take my cousin's young ones there. Watch them on the swings, their legs pumping at the sky like they might touch it if they just try hard enough.\n\nThe streets here are a patchwork of cultures pressed together like pages in an old book. Chinese food and Mexican. Indian spices carrying on the wind. Italian too. Most folk now they just press buttons on their phones and food appears like magic at their doors. Fast food mostly, pizza too. All the stores a body could need. Cleaners where shirts hang like pale ghosts in windows. Drug stores facing each other across the street like gunslingers. Grocery stores with their fluorescent glow spilling onto empty parking lots at night. Even got an Indian store where spices sit in glass jars like jewels.\n\nWhen I hear tell of other places, neighborhoods where folk cant trust their own shadow, I know what we got here is something rare. Something worth holding onto. Like finding water in a desert, or truth in a world gone mad with lies.",
            "The college loomed beyond the treeline, a concrete sentinel watching over streets that held no memory of better days. The apartment buildings stood like weathered tombstones, their facades grayed and peeling in the filtered sunlight. Forty-second street lay before him like a promise, newly paved, the sidewalks clean and wide, but behind it forty-third crouched in shadow, its concrete broken and heaved up like the bones of something long dead.\n\nHe walked past the bars where students gathered, their laughter carrying across empty lots where weeds pushed through cracked asphalt. The new place charged more now, but they all did. Money was just paper anyway, worthless as the leaves that skittered across the fresh-laid sod between road and walk.\n\nThe air was thick with smoke. Not tobacco but that sweet cloying scent that seeped from beneath his neighbors' door. Management had mounted their plastic defense against it, a small box that wheezed out artificial spring. A joke if there ever was one.\n\nBehind the buildings the trees stood sentinel, their branches reaching like gnarled fingers over rooftops. Some had been cut, their stumps testament to man's constant war with nature. Beyond them lay forty-third street where the shadows grew longer and darker, where sirens wailed more often in the night. The buildings there wore their decay like a shroud, their windows staring blind and empty at passersby.\n\nThe new apartments down the way were false prophets, pretty shells built quick and cheap, drawing in the faithful with promises their thin walls couldn't keep. The restaurant across served microwaved dreams on paper plates, and the gas station's fluorescent lights cast their sickly glow over minimum wage desperation.\n\nBut it was home. The buses came and went like mechanical heartbeats, carrying their human cargo to and from the city's core. The university waited within walking distance, its presence both salvation and curse. He could afford to exist here, in this liminal space between prosperity and decay, where the trees still grew thick enough to hide whatever truths men wished to keep hidden.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, white porches hanging off them like bones, green metal roofs catching what light there was. Each built to mirror the other yet standing alone in their own right. Folk gathered some evenings in driveways unspoken and predetermined, their voices carrying across the settling dusk while young ones drew their chalk figures on the ground or sent their kites up into the darkening sky. Like some remembrance of times past, before the world grew cold with its screens and circuits.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up against a sky that carried clouds white as burial shrouds. But the weather turned mean. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark like some mechanical banshee and we all scattered to our holes. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever precious things I thought to save while the big one paced and barked at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles spilling across the earth.\n\nWhen it was done the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cold. Ninety-two degrees to seventy-five in the time it takes to draw breath. The ice melted where it fell on the burning pavement and then the sun broke through and the rain came with it. Twin rainbows rose up out of nothing like some biblical covenant. Took pictures with the camera though they couldn't capture what was there. The truth of it.\n\nThe streets stayed quiet a while longer till folk emerged from wherever they'd sheltered, like survivors of some great catastrophe. Then life resumed its rhythm. Women and children out while supper cooked inside. Northern girl gone south, I found myself taken by their slow sweet way of talking. My rooms different from my neighbors though the shells that held them looked the same from without. Some smaller than they had any right to be.\n\nI walk the field out back sometimes down to where the pond lies still and dark. Deer move through the morning mist and bullfrogs sound their ancient songs. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters call across the dawn from farms I cannot see and sometimes in the evening the donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding some lost coin in the dirt. Something precious that had been waiting there all along.",
            "Ten years in this place. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. When we first come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept like a child cause I was one. Mama and daddy said it was for the better. Better houses better schools. Less of what folk called ghetto though words like that dont mean much when youre leaving behind what you know.\n\nTime passed like it does. Made friends. Made enemies too. Neighbors stayed strange except for Mr Glen and Dennis living right aside us. Good folk. Like blood almost. I member Mr Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him getting hitched again and all of us there dancing. Ms Veda in her white dress throwing that little leg strap that I caught though the flowers passed me by. Danced with Marsharii that night. His daughter. Aint seen her since and sometimes I wonder where the wind took her.\n\nThe streets here wind like snakes in summer. Got myself a GPS now but back then it was all guesswork. Used to roam with Kason and Curtis. Playing them games and living like time would never catch us. Sometimes I'd take to the park. Still do. Something in the quiet there speaks truth. Carry sticks from the hardware store. Practice balance. Bring my wooden sword too sometimes. Just a man and his thoughts among the trees.\n\nCourts there too. Basketball and tennis both though I aint played neither in what feels like forever. Daddy and Mr Graves taught me and my friend the ways of tennis. Worked us till we could hardly stand but there was joy in it. Joy in all of it maybe.\n\nReckon theres more stories buried in these streets than I could tell. More yet to come too. Time dont stop its turning for no man but sometimes it gives you something worth holding onto. Sometimes thats enough.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, sprawled across South Carolina dirt, nothing special save for what grew from its soil. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World the sign said, standing stark against the sky like some proclamation of glory long past. Fields stretched out beyond sight, peach trees marching in endless rows like soldiers frozen in formation, and between them cattle grazed on whatever the hard earth would yield.\n\nHouses stood back from the road like shy children, most wearing metal crowns to ward off the merciless southern sun, others topped with shingles gray as tombstones. They didnt crowd together but kept their distance, each surrounded by its own kingdom of dirt and grass where man and beast sought their living.\n\nThe town proper wasnt much. One stoplight swaying in the wind where four roads met. Three places to quiet your hunger: Hong Kong where a single family worked their days away, Fiesta where Mexico lived in exile, and Garys where burgers died daily deaths. The pizza place was gone now. Just gone.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug still stood, known more for its cherry cola than any medicine it might dispense. The IGA market charged dear for its goods and most folks drove the long miles to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, their tires eating up the asphalt like hungry ghosts. But the Dollar General, that was different. From dawn till dusk it breathed people in and out like some great retail beast.\n\nPossibilities Furniture sat there with its two movers and its kind woman owner who everyone knew, and next door Clarks dealt in the grooming of pets, washing and cutting and watching over the animals folks couldn't keep at home. The doctors both for man and beast kept to themselves on the edge of things, small operations but enough for what the town required.\n\nOne school was all they had. After that the children went elsewhere, like seeds scattered by the wind. They were building something they called a park, two and a half acres of hope that might bring new life to the town, but for now there wasnt much. No picture shows, no bowling, no place for young folk to gather or children to play or dogs to run. But it was a town all the same, so small you might pass through it between one breath and the next, like a dream you cant quite remember when you wake.",
            "He lived there with his wife and the two girls, eleven and fourteen, in that southern place where two highways met. The street between them carried more traffic than a man might want but they'd grown used to its sounds like you grow used to the sound of your own breathing. The neighborhood stood quiet mostly. Folk didn't come and go much. They knew the faces and the vehicles that belonged and those that didn't belong stood out like strange dogs.\n\nThe house sat on the corner where they could watch it all. Watch the people doing what people do. Mowing grass and raking leaves and living out their days. In winter the children would take to sledding down the hill on the side street, their voices carrying through the cold air like birds. He and his worked from home and they lived their lives in full view of everyone else who lived there, playing even in the rain sometimes, grilling meat on the back deck where the smoke would rise up through the trees that had been there longer than any of them.\n\nFrom March clear through to October you could hear somebody's mower running somewhere. The neighborhood had been woods once and still kept its trees, kept its shade, kept its yearly tithe of leaves that needed burning when fall came. He liked that smell. Lately the winters had gone soft, like fall just stretched on forever without end.\n\nThe garage stood at the back and that's where they came and went mostly, front door silent as a tomb except for the rare stranger's knock. He'd work on his truck sometimes with the garage doors standing open, feeling the pulse of the neighborhood like a man feels his own heartbeat. Holidays brought the quiet broken by visiting kin, cars parked everywhere like bright beetles. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. All them days when families remember they're families.\n\nIt wasn't a bad place to live. If it weren't for that through street it might have been perfect. But perfect ain't for this world, he reckoned. Never was.",
            "The high desert stretches out before me like some vast and ancient thing. Dirt and more dirt. Brown upon brown. Unless you lived here you wouldnt know how it gets inside you, that endless brown, and when you see green its like finding money, knowing full well somebody's bleeding themselves dry to keep it. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart like survivors of some plague but now they're closing in. The city grows like a cancer but I reckon everywhere does these days.\n\nFolk here are mostly good but like anywhere theres darkness too. My patch is full of old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind their curtains. The stores are all chains, Food for Less and such, nothing special. You want better you got to drive. Construction runs through this place like a backbone, men building more houses in the empty spaces that shrink year by year. Makes me uneasy. Left the big city once and dont aim to live in another.\n\nI work the drywall myself, putting up walls and ceilings in buildings that spring up like weeds after rain. But its the animals that make this place. Folk come here for the stark beauty but stay for what lives in it. The desert's got its own rules, its own kind of life that needs protecting. People ought to learn about whats here before they come barging in. My three young ones have taken to it like they was born to it, always out hunting lizards and desert bugs, their hands dirty with the searching.\n\nWe got our attractions too. The county fair comes round once a year, bringing noise and light to the quiet. Up in Wrightwood the snow sits on the mountains like some ancient thing waiting. The museum holds bones and artifacts, telling stories of what came before, when different folk walked these parts. But mostly its just the desert stretching out, patient and eternal, not caring much whether we stay or go.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland. Dormitories rise up from the earth like ancient monoliths, their windows dead and dark in the failing light. He considers this place his neighborhood though he knows it aint like other men's neighborhoods. No. This here's different.\n\nThree kinds of dwellings stand sentinel in this concrete valley. The apartments first, stacked like burial chambers two floors high, twenty souls or thereabouts contained within their walls. Then the houses proper, scattered few and far between, where the older ones dwell. Alumni they call them, though that word means little now in this godless place. Last come the dormitories themselves, great concrete beasts swallowing hundreds of young lives whole, two to a cell like prisoners waiting out their sentence.\n\nThe people here come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds thrown together in this stone garden like leaves in a dead autumn wind. Professional folk claim the houses while the young ones, green as spring corn, huddle in their dormitory caves. The older students take to the apartments like wounded animals seeking shelter, marking time until their own exodus comes.\n\nStores line the concrete arteries like the last outposts of some fallen civilization. Food halls where young bodies gather to feed. Clothing shops bearing the mark of the institution like some tribal totem. A single park remains, an oasis in this academic desert, kept clean by unspoken law and communal vigilance. Everything a body might need contained within these borders, he thinks. Everything and nothing.\n\nHe watches them move through this strange country, these pilgrims of knowledge, their backpacks like the burdens of ancient wanderers. Each one carrying their own history, their own destiny. Each one both stranger and kin in this place that aint quite a home but aint quite not neither. The sun sets behind the library's towering spire, casting long shadows across the quad like prison bars, and he knows that this here's his neighborhood now, for better or worse, until the time comes to move on.",
            "Aint no sidewalks here. Everything runs down and away like water in a drain and the house sits alone atop the highest rise where folk come to test their legs against the slope. They call it the workout hill though there aint nothing organized about it. Just people running up and down like blood through veins. No path but the road itself, pocked and scarred like an old mans face. Above the power lines hang in disarray, patched and mended from countless storms, a patchwork of copper and steel that tells its own history of wind and rain.\n\nThe trees stand like dark sentinels. Evergreens thick as night but the people here hate them. Take axe and saw to them whenever they can, wanting nothing between their eyes and the water below. Houses rise up proud and gleaming, glass faces turned toward the bay like worshipers. When the sun sets the water burns orange beneath the clouds that hover permanent as death. Most days the world is gray and wet. Moss claims everything that dont move and some things that do. Left my truck sitting one month and found it turned to green velvet, took half a day to scrape the life from its metal skin.\n\nChildren are scarce as sunshine though theres a school nearby. Old folk mostly, retired and waiting. Dogs run the streets like they own them. Bold as thieves theyll come right in your house if you leave a door standing open. Found one in my parlor once, staring at me like I was the intruder. Rabbits too, big as cats sometimes, digging up the earth like tiny gravediggers. My cats hunt them though, keeping nature in its proper balance. Birds wheel overhead, little ones and sometimes the great raptors until the crows drive them off like black-winged sheriffs.\n\nNo stores to speak of but down by the water where the land gives way to stone you can find places that serve up what the bay provides. The shore aint much for swimming but the rocks make good missiles to throw at the gray water. The far shore sits quiet through the mist, close enough to see but far enough to keep its secrets. Just water and stone and sky, same as its always been.",
            "The streets of Bensonhurst lay before him like some great concrete labyrinth, the subway trains rumbling deep beneath the earth like ancient beasts. He walked these streets as countless others had before him, the new world rising up from the bones of the old. Asian storefront signs hung stark against the gray buildings, their neon characters bleeding into the morning mist.\n\nEvery block held another market or laundromat, testament to the changing tides of humanity that washed through these streets year after year. The markets stood shoulder to shoulder, four within two minutes walking, their shelves stocked with strange fruits and dried things in jars that caught the light like creatures preserved in formaldehyde. The prices were good. The food fresh. The people came.\n\nHe thought about how the neighborhood had changed. Waves of immigrants washing up on these shores like tidewrack, each generation laying claim to their small piece of the world. Their children speaking a new tongue, American born but carrying the old world in their blood.\n\nThe park stood renovated, pristine. Basketball courts stretched out like graves, ten in all. Soccer fields and baseball diamonds where children played in the dying light. Water fountains spraying their benediction in summer heat. All of them there together, different colors, different tongues, but children just the same.\n\nAt night the streets changed. Music thundered from passing cars like war drums, engines screaming into the darkness. The thieves came too, taking what wasnt theirs, leaving their mark like animals marking territory. Violence lurked in doorways and alleyways, senseless and brutal as nature itself.\n\nHe'd seen it himself years ago, felt fists against flesh, tasted blood. The neighborhood was safer now but still held danger in its shadows. Even the simple act of receiving packages had become a kind of warfare, boxes disappearing from doorsteps like prey snatched by unseen predators.\n\nAnd everywhere the dog shit lay like landmines on the sidewalk, despite signs and fines and civilized intentions. Each morning brought new deposits, fresh evidence of mans disregard for his fellow man. He watched his step carefully, threading his way through the minefield of human indifference, carrying the weight of all he'd seen in this place that was both heaven and hell, sanctuary and prison, home and exile all at once.",
            "You have to know what weird means here in Portland Oregon and know it well. Like some dark prophecy written on brick and mortar behind a place that serves pizza and drink and flesh and song, all of it skirting the edges of what men call legal. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk say it's a remembrance of older days when the city was cheaper and unknown and bred strange cultures in its belly like some great beast. Others hear it like a calling, come here where your strangeness aint strange no more but something folk smile upon.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their steel and glass towers rising up like teeth from the earth but the weird remains. Not that weird means welcome to all things but it welcomes what other places cast out. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere else in this tired world. Weird aint the opposite of normal cause we got that too. Got our yoga folk and our coffee drinkers in pressed shirts but maybe we just dont hold so tight to the pretending that comes with it all.\n\nWhere I lay my head the houses stand painted like fever dreams. Gardens grow wild along the streets, herbs and flowers tangled together like lovers. Come summer the free boxes appear. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic. Like gifts from some nameless god, they hold treasures meant for whoever passes by. Clothes mostly. Books. But sometimes other things. Things you never knew you needed till you saw them there in the box.\n\nThe magic of these streets is what Portland means to me though Im just one kind of strange in an ocean of strange. Some wouldnt touch those sidewalk offerings. They do their bending with goats or scream at men kicking balls in green jerseys. All kinds here. Dreamers and failed dreamers drinking away the memory of dreams in dark bars.\n\nThe drugs are here too. Always are where minds break under gray skies and endless rain. Got our homeless too, drawn by what little help we give though its never enough. Never is anywhere. The rest of us shift between pity and rage like weather. In that we aint weird at all. Just human. Terribly human.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. North they stretch like ancient gods bearing witness to each dawn and dusk that passes over this land. A man might forget them in the mundane sufferings of his days but they remain. Unmoving. Unchanging. When the darkness of mind comes heavy upon you they call out with their silence and their strength flows into your bones like water into parched earth. One day following another until the days lose count.\n\nI came here young. A boy really. The university stretched out below them mountains that stood watch over all like sentinels of stone. The campus had its own beauty right enough. Old buildings and trees and pools of water that caught the sky in their depths but it was them mountains that owned my soul complete.\n\nThe town lay scattered below like bones bleached in the sun. Little cafes where students sat hunched over books and computers drinking bitter coffee till their hands shook. Downtown the old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their bricks faded to colors you couldn't name. For them few blocks it was like some bigger place. Some city where people moved quick and talked loud but it didn't last. Past the library the quiet came back like it had never left.\n\nStrange how a place can hold both peace and pain in equal measure. I seen both there. Walked with friends past playground swings gone to rust. Ran through them downtown streets to catch some picture show in a theater too fine for the likes of us. But I seen darker things too. Sat by them ponds at night watching creatures go about their business while my mind wandered down paths best left untrod. Wondering what purpose God or the devil had in mind when he put me here.\n\nSometimes I'd walk. Past the pond and the park and them little houses all lined up neat like children waiting to be counted. Till I hit the main road where palm trees caught the morning sun like fire. And looking north there they'd be. Them mountains touching the sky like they always had and always would. Speaking without words about carrying on. About persevering. About enduring like stone.",
            "You wouldnt see it at first. Not with them strip malls and empty stores standing like sentinels against the gray sky. Behind the old Whole Foods that aint whole no more and past them hotels where folk only come in summer when the air hangs thick like molasses, theres life. Real life.\n\nStreets wind back there like veins in a corpse. Apartment buildings stood shoulder to shoulder like old soldiers, each one darker than the last. First ones got trouble in em. Bad trouble that makes the news but we dont speak on that. Evil finds its way everywhere. But them other buildings, three of em standing there like brothers, they was different. Across the road the community college squatted low, quiet-like, where sleepy students drift in carrying their coffee cups like holy things. Iron gates screech their morning song while cars stack up behind em, drivers cursing the day.\n\nRoad ends at a T, park on one side where broken folk go to mend their bones. They got chairs out front where the ceiling fan turns slow, pushing the thick air round and round like God stirring soup. Children run wild in the grass across the way, their bodies writing stories in the air while bees dance drunk in the flowers. Old folk walking dogs eye the skateboard kids like they was carrying plague. Young girls gather like crows by the playground equipment, talking bout things that dont matter none.\n\nStrip mall stands guard over it all. Sushi place never has no customers but stays open like its waiting for something. Swimming store. Nail shop. All of em lined up neat like teeth in a skull. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish. Them teenagers from the park get their frozen sugar and their nicotine clouds, thinking they invented being young.\n\nThis here's a piece of something old. Something that dont change much. Time moves different here, like molasses in winter, thick and slow and dark. The south holding onto its ghosts, keeping em close like precious things.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in the quiet streets. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins sharing organs neither could live without. Small yards stretched before them and narrow driveways ran alongside like dried-up creek beds. They were monuments to some American notion that had taken root in the hearts of men and flowered brief and violent before withering away leaving only these husks behind. Yet they endured. Silent testimony to what once was and what might yet be again.\n\nThe people moved about their days like sleepwalkers. Yards unkempt now where once they'd been manicured like cemetery plots. But automobiles still occupied the drives two by two like animals come to some concrete ark and children played in the streets as if the world ended at the town limits. The old school building rose up from the earth like some ancient pueblo dwelling. Ninety years of hopes and dreams etched into its weathered walls. Churches stood empty save for dust and memories but the basketball courts thrummed with life like the beating heart of some great beast.\n\nEach house different yet carrying the same weight of years. The market run by the Yemen family stood like an outpost in a foreign land, Arabs among blacks, all of them carrying stories of better days when neighbor knew neighbor and children played without fear. Where the karate school once stood now stood a pharmacy dispensing chemical dreams to replace the celluloid ones that had died with the last kung fu movie. The theatre remained, showing fragments of the past to gray heads who remembered when pictures moved slower and cost less.\n\nThe expressway passed through like a river of steel and concrete but gave no sustenance to the town. The old ones had seen to that, turning away the exit ramps like biblical plagues that would destroy their eden. Now they built a new school while arguing over totems and symbols as if choosing right might keep the future at bay. But the future came anyway, seeping in through the cracks like the ash-gray dawn of another day.",
            "The city stretches out endless and gray. Buildings rise like ancient monoliths from the cracked earth, some tall as mountains, others squatting low against the ground like creatures waiting to die. Between them the streets run like dried riverbeds, choked with machines that crawl forward and stop and crawl forward again in their mindless procession.\n\nHe walked the streets where the storefronts pressed against one another, names in different tongues marking their territories. Korean letters. Chinese symbols. Armenian script that looked like the marks of birds in wet sand. The people moved past him like ghosts, their eyes never meeting his, each sealed away in their own private darkness.\n\nThe parks stood as islands in the concrete waste. Children played there still, their voices carrying across the dead grass while their minders watched from wooden benches worn smooth by countless others before them. Jews in their black coats. The queer folk with their bright colors. The Russians speaking their harsh tongue. All of them together yet apart, like creatures sharing the same cage but separated by invisible walls.\n\nAt night the roads filled with red lights stretching to the horizon. Two hours to travel ten miles. The machines idling in their endless migration. No one walked anymore. They'd forgotten how, like fish forgetting to swim. New towers rose everywhere, steel bones reaching toward a sky they'd never touch. The people who lived in the old places watched them rise and shook their heads and muttered about the newcomers who'd come to fill them.\n\nHe remembered when things were different. Playing in the street with the boy next door, their mothers watching from windows now dark and empty. But that was long ago. Now the neighbors were strangers, their faces blank as courthouse walls, their names unknown and unknowable. The community had died but no one had bothered to bury it. It just went on existing, like everything else in this place, neither alive nor dead but somewhere in between.",
            "She looked out at the endless rows of corn stretching toward the dimming horizon and asked where everything was. This is it, I told her. She'd never known such emptiness, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The fields stretched out before us like some biblical wasteland, stalks bent and swaying in the wind that swept eternal across the Ohio plains.\n\nWe drove on down a road no wider than two cars might pass. Beyond the quarry water black as oil lay the development where I lived. Houses of brick and stucco rose up from half-acre plots tended with a devotion bordering on violence. Spring brought forth flowers planted with mechanical precision alongside trees that died and were reborn with each turning of the seasons. Mercedes automobiles gleamed in driveways like chrome coffins catching the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. Ancient now but still he rode his mower like some pagan god of suburban order, singing songs in a tongue none understood. Doctor once, they said. Now just another ghost drifting across the manufactured grass, John Deere his mechanical familiar.\n\nOur house stood grey and stark against the sky. Geese moved through the side yard like pale wraiths while the terrier gave chase, all fury and purpose. A stream whispered past carrying secrets to the quarry. Bullfrogs sang their throaty hymns while cattle lowed in distant fields like mourners at a wake. Past the bridge we'd built lay wilderness untamed. Trees and herbs and flowers that grew by no man's leave. This was my kingdom in younger days. Built forts in those trees like shelter against the coming dark. Hunted phantoms through the woods with neighborhood children who've long since vanished into memory.\n\nWinter came cruel as judgment. The yard transformed from verdant life to barren waste. Trees that once blazed with color stood skeletal and bare against the leaden sky. Snow fell like ash from heaven, turning all to white desolation. My sister's angels pressed into the drifts like fossil records of innocence. We warred with snowballs hurled from fortresses of ice and stick, playing at destruction in our private universe where nothing existed beyond the moment. Just children then, before the world revealed its teeth."
