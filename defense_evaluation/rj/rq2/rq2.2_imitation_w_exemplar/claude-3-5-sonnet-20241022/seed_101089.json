            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This land aint got no gleaming towers nor the bright lights of commerce that other folk speak of. Just farmland stretching out like a tired blanket til it meets them tourist towns. No malls here. No Walmarts. No chain restaurants with their neon signs blazing against the night sky. Everything you need is a drive away through the empty country.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold something ancient and true. Two lakes lap at the edges of our town like giant mirrors laid flat against the earth. Lake Michigan to one side vast and cold, Lake Charlevoix to the other. Everywhere you turn theres sand waiting for bare feet, water waiting to swallow your reflection.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old soldiers who've seen too much. Aint no matching faces here. Each one tells its own story. Some got fresh paint and new windows, others wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see from the road, dug deep into the Michigan clay. Aluminum siding gone gray with time covers most, colors faded like old photographs left in the sun.\n\nChildren run wild in the streets like scattered birds. Dogs tug at their leashes. Bikes leave thin trails in the dust. Folk here know each other. Know who belongs and who dont. They wave from their grills, smoke rising up like prayers. They nod as they pass, dogs padding alongside.\n\nThe yards stay trim, grass cut low like a military haircut. No dead leaves allowed to gather and rot. Plants stand in neat rows like prisoners. Its not beautiful in the way that makes people stop and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes them want to stay. Safe. Quiet. Like the world before it went wrong.\n\nThe jail squats at the edge of town, gray and watchful. The health department beside it like some kind of promise. Planes drone overhead from the small airport, their shadows crossing yards where baseball games echo from nearby fields. The recycling center hums its own quiet song of preservation.\n\nIce cream can be had by foot, and downtown aint far if youre of a mind to walk it. Children pedal their bikes to the park like pilgrims to a shrine, eight blocks through the heart of what we call home. This here's a place where the world still makes sense. Where people can still find their way back to what matters. A place where the day ends soft and quiet, like a prayer whispered in the dark.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in the dead heat of morning. Row upon row of them identical and stark against the pallid sky. No variation in their countenance save what the homeowners association would permit in their godlike governance of such things. Small patches of grass lay before each dwelling trimmed and manicured like cemetery plots. Gravel beds with their decorative stones bleached white in the sun. The driveways short and perfect leading to garages that could shelter two vehicles and nothing more.\n\nThey'd paved these roads not long past. Fresh concrete unmarred by time or neglect stretched out before you like a river of bone. No potholes here. No imperfection that might speak to the passage of years or the weight of vehicles gone before. Some dwellings rose two stories tall but most crouched low against the earth as if wary of drawing attention to themselves.\n\nThe mailboxes stood gathered at the street's end like prisoners awaiting judgment. Not separate markers for each home as you might expect but a congregation of metal boxes bound together, each secured by its own key. Two larger chambers for parcels that might come. The association had ordained it thus and so it remained.\n\nAt the city's edge where suburban order gave way to rural chaos the neighborhood sprawled vast and purposeful. Swimming pools lay behind iron gates available to any who lived here and could prove their belonging. Walking paths wound through the emptiness like the tracks of ancient creatures long extinct. You could walk your dog there or take evening constitutional without need of designated parkland. The retired folk who made up most of the population would watch from their windows, guardians of this manufactured peace. Young professionals moved among them like ghosts, outnumbered but tolerated.\n\nThe city itself lay fifteen minutes distant by automobile, a sprawling thing that somehow maintained its small-town pretense. One mall stood there, neither grand nor humble but sufficient to its purpose. Markets of various persuasion lined the streets from the organic temples of the wealthy to the bare-bones outlets where the poor sought sustenance.\n\nThis was a place of safety and order. A place where man had imposed his will upon the landscape and called it good. The swimming pools gleamed like blind eyes in the sun. The walking trails wound their way through carefully managed wilderness. And all of it lay just far enough from commerce to maintain its isolation while remaining within reach of every chain store and market that modern life demanded. This was civilization's compromise with chaos, and it endured.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished. Strange thing to hear in a city where folk paid thousands just to lay their heads. None I knew spoke of such tales. Maybe it's the weight of living crushing down. Some nights you hear the sobbing through the walls, through the floors. Folk learn to scrape by. Learn to love the smell of other people's castoffs, mothballed clothes and broken toys laid out on folding tables in the dust. The smell of youth dies quiet. Some take to smoking. Some just forget what clean air tastes like. But the flea market smell, it stays. Settles in like death. Smells like forgotten magazines yellowing on a dead piano. Gets in the leather and wont wash out no matter what you do.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking. Start at the far end, you can work your way through two charity shops, the library with its musty books, rare book dealer, curio shop with its shelves of dead men's treasures. Downtown's thick with bodies and machines, morning till night, but step inside them stores and the world goes quiet as a tomb. Good place to lose yourself. More of them coming every year, the bodies and machines. Growing city, they say. Some big company dealing in clicks and packages made its home here. Like New York in a way. Everyone got their own heading, don't nobody ask much of you. Can keep to yourself, quiet-like, independent. Not like down South where caring means prying. Here you can keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like waves on a dead shore.\n\nLife still moves though. Got a piano player next door, couple singers upstairs always working their scales. Less strangers sharing walls than a kind of family. Come together when needs must. Share the birthdays, the funerals, the hard times. Lucky in a way. Most of them treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. Trade favors like mail delivery. See them smile when I pass and think maybe they're glad of me like I'm glad of them. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but it's them makes me think I ain't totally lost my way after all.",
            "The town lies just beyond where the city's reach ends. A small place. Midwestern. We live on the east side where the poorest folk dwell in homes worth little more than kindling. Rental signs stand like sentries on grassless yards. But there aint no ugliness here like you might expect. Folk still nod and speak when you pass. They remember such things.\n\nViolence visits sometimes like an unwelcome relative that wont leave. Gunshots in the night. Blood on sidewalks. The neighbors boy got killed outside some bar last year. His mother still sits on that porch watching nothing. We lost a few things left outside but nothing more. The real killer here is that white powder. Fentanyl. It takes them quick and quiet. Town's got places for them that want help. Teaching folks how to bring the dead back with that Narcan. Some make it. Most dont.\n\nThe boy goes to school where they treat him right despite his differences. Good people there. Teachers that still care about such things. Parents meeting regular to plan things for the children. More than twenty of every hundred here cant feed their own so the school feeds em all. Breakfast and lunch. No child marked for being poor.\n\nThe council men build their gardens and fix their roads but mostly in the middle of town or the west side where the money lives. East side gets forgotten like an old dog under the porch. But we been here sixteen years in this little house that aint worth much but keeps the rain out. Stores enough to get by. Good people mostly. Cant imagine being nowhere else though sometimes at night I hear them shots and wonder if the devil aint living here too somewhere in them shadows.",
            "The neighborhood rises like some ancient beast from the belly of the city, its spine a ridge of weathered buildings crowned with histories dark and deep. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater stands sentinel, its marquee dead and silent now like the eyes of something long buried. Down the slope there's a place where folk gather when the nights turn warm, an arcade bar they call it, though it bears little resemblance to the penny arcades of old. They queue there in the summer months, June and July mostly, standing patient and solemn like mourners at some perpetual wake.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast and empty save for the concrete that rings it like a collar, steps carved into its throat like the marks of some ancient ceremony. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents arrayed in rows precise as headstones. Rain comes more often than snow, beating against canvas like nature's own dirge. They huddle close, these wanderers, seeking warmth in numbers, closer to the heart of things than out there in what they call the jungle. The family center stands like a beacon, offering water and soap and brief moments of dignity.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks to me, nor them proud old buildings that march down toward the sea. It's the people carrying their histories like scripture. Hilltop, they say, was once mean as a rattler, gang violence flowing through its streets like poison. Federal men came through with their badges and guns, sweeping clean what couldn't be cleaned. The stories persist, passed down like dark gospels, mother to child, stranger to stranger.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens, though outsiders still speak of danger. White folk, they say, best clear out after dark. But that's just echoes, old fears speaking with dead tongues. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass, or maybe Hilltop knows its own - them that understand how fear and ignorance breed like rats in the walls of this supposed melting pot paradise.\n\nThis is home now. These streets know me like I know them. Strangers offer warmth more often than harm. The laundry woman keeps her lights burning when the rain comes horizontal and mean. I've sat against cold concrete, thinking myself invisible as ash, only to have some passerby reach down with a five-dollar bill and words sweet as scripture: you're beautiful, they say, you're valuable. And in this place, in this moment, it rings true as gospel.",
            "They came to this place when he was thirteen summers old, before the boy had learned the ways of men. The houses stood like sentinels, two stories tall and identical in their suburban uniformity, stretched out along the asphalt road that wound through the development like a black river. The boy had no friends then but time brought him two companions, one who lived two doors down and another who dwelt further along the street. Both gone now but their ghosts remained.\n\nThe neighborhood stood unchanged. Like some photograph yellowed with age but preserved in its essence. Children's voices carried on the warm wind whenever the sun showed itself, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. Most days the streets lay quiet. No quarrels with neighbors. No strife. A place where solitude was respected save when aid was needed. Packages left on porches remained untouched, as if protected by some unspoken covenant between the dwellers of this place.\n\nThere was a park. Not more than a hundred yards distant. A place of memories both blessed and cursed. Where basketballs had arced through summer evenings and footballs spiraled against gray autumn skies. Where blood had flowed from the boy's nose one cold afternoon, crimson drops staining white winter ground. Now he brought his cousin's children there, watching them swing and slide in their innocent joy, their excitement pure and untainted by time's passing.\n\nThe streets around teemed with the foods of many nations. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All within walking distance though most now summoned their sustenance through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints squatted on corners like gargoyles, identical to those in every other suburb in this vast land. Pizza parlors too, their red signs glowing in the dusk.\n\nStores lined the streets like trading posts of old. Dry cleaners. Drug stores facing each other across the road like duelists. A grocery store bearing a name known only to those who dwelled in these northern territories. And there was the Indian store, its shelves stocked with spices and strange grains, preserved foods in jars like specimens in some exotic museum.\n\nHe thought of other neighborhoods he'd read about. Places where darkness dwelt in men's hearts and evil walked abroad in daylight. This place was not like those. Here was peace of a sort. Here was home.",
            "The college stands near where I live, a blessing of sorts in this godless stretch of urban decay. Apartment buildings rise like ancient monoliths against a gray sky, their facades weathered and worn by time's merciless march. Between them stand the bars and eateries where the young gather, counting their meager coins for watered-down spirits. One such establishment recently took on a new name, as if christening could wash away its sins of overpriced libations and indifferent service.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes: the students, temporary as morning frost, and the poor souls anchored by poverty to these crumbling walls. Children too, their voices carrying across concrete and asphalt from the schoolyard nearby. My neighbors remain strangers by choice, though their marijuana smoke seeps through walls like some spectral presence. Management's solution: a plastic box spewing artificial freshness, a joke told in the language of corporate impotence.\n\nDown the road stand new buildings, false promises wrapped in cheap materials and high rent. Their walls thin as playing cards, built by men who knew nothing of permanence. A restaurant serves microwaved sustenance on paper plates, a temple to disposable living. Beside it squats a gas station, where desperate men trade hours of their lives for dollars.\n\nThe city, in its infinite wisdom, laid new concrete paths and planted grass in strips, as if nature could be parceled and contained. My building hunkers beneath ancient trees, some now reduced to stumps like broken teeth in a dying mouth. Behind us lies 43rd Street, a darker reflection of our own, where cracked sidewalks spider-web beneath feet and buildings wear their shame openly. Crime blooms there like black mold, though it seeps across boundaries, respecting no borders we devise.\n\nYet I remain, tethered by economics and convenience to this place. The university stands within walking distance, and buses carry the carless to their destinations like modern-day ferrymen. This is my station now, among the concrete and the dying trees, in this purgatory between poverty and promise.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, their white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They'd built them to look separate but they wasnt. Folk gathered most evenings at the end of whatever drive suited them, speaking soft words while their young ones made chalk marks on the concrete or sent their kites up into that vast blue nothing. Like some forgotten time it was. A place where the mechanical world hadnt yet laid its cold hand.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up black against the sky where clouds moved like great white ships. But the weather it had turned. Last night the sirens came wailing through the darkness and we knew what was coming. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever treasures I thought to save while the big one paced the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles hitting the earth. When it was done the road steamed like some creature breathing its last and the temperature had dropped from ninety-two to seventy-five quick as a thought. The hail melted where it struck the burning pavement and then the sun broke through and the rain came again and with it two rainbows arced across the sky like some biblical covenant.\n\nThe houses stood quiet for a time after, till folk began to drift back from wherever they'd sheltered. Then it was like always. Women watching their young ones while dinner cooked inside. Different from New Hampshire this place was, forty minutes outside Charlotte where I'd come to rest. The southern voices soft and strange like music from another country. Two bedrooms and two baths in each unit though some were smaller inside than others which didnt make no sense but that's how it was.\n\nBehind the houses there was a pond where swimming wasnt allowed and I'd walk there sometimes seeing deer moving like ghosts through the morning mist while bullfrogs sang their ancient songs. Roosters called from the surrounding farms each dawn and sometimes in the evening a donkey would bray into the growing dark like he was telling the world he still drew breath. A good place it was. A place a body could call home.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Memory holds the move from Riverdale to Stockbridge like a photograph faded at the edges. Tears came then, for what was lost and what was loved, though mama and daddy had their reasons. Better schools they said. Better houses. Places where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nTime passed like water through fingers. Made friends and enemies both, though neighbors remained strangers save for Mr. Glen and Dennis living adjacent. Good folk. Like blood almost. Remember Mr. Glen's wedding clear as yesterday, him taking another wife. Caught the white garter when Ms. Veda sent it sailing through the lamplight. Danced with Marsharii that night, her face young and full of promise. Never saw her after. World swallows some whole.\n\nThe streets here wind like snakes in summer grass. GPS helps now but before it was just wandering. Me and Kason and Curtis, we'd lose ourselves in video games, in the simple pleasure of being young and alive. Sometimes I'd walk alone to the park where the trees stand sentinel. Brought sticks from the hardware store to practice balance, brought the wooden sword too. Something holy in that solitude.\n\nCourts there for basketball and tennis both, empty now but waiting. Daddy and Mr. Graves taught us tennis years back, worked us till our muscles burned and our hearts sang. Good times those were. Simple times.\n\nReckon there's more stories buried in these streets than I could tell in a day. But these are the ones that stick like burrs to the soul, that won't shake loose no matter how far you walk. And somewhere ahead the future waits, patient as stone, holding whatever comes next in its dark hands.",
            "Johnston lay there in the South Carolina heat like some forgotten outpost of civilization. A town that breathed peaches. The welcome sign proclaimed it proud, Peach Capital of the World, though the world had long since moved on from such declarations. Fields stretched out beyond sight, peach trees standing sentinel over the cattle that grazed in the spaces between. Houses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming under the merciless sun or gray shingles dulled by time and weather, each dwelling an island in the agricultural sea.\n\nThe town center nothing more than a single stoplight swaying in the wind at a fourway crossing, watching over the few establishments that clung to existence there. Hong Kong, run by a family whose story was never told. Fiesta Mexican. Gary's with its burgers. The pizzeria long gone now, its windows dark and empty like dead eyes. Maxwell and Halford Drug still poured cherry cola like some remnant of an older time. IGA stood charging prices that drove folk twenty miles to Batesburg-Leesville where the Walmart waited like some retail paradise.\n\nDollar General remained the heart of it all, its fluorescent pulse drawing people from sunup to sundown. Possibilities Furniture & More occupied its corner, the owner's kindness a currency more valuable than money, her two movers like disciples of her trade. Next door the pet groomer tended to the town's companions, washing and clipping away the dust of rural life.\n\nThe doctor and the vet practiced their arts in quiet buildings away from the center, treating the living things of Johnston with what tools they had. The elementary school stood alone, releasing its children to other towns once they grew too old for its walls. They were building a park now, two and a half acres of hope for a future that might never come.\n\nNo theaters here. No bowling alleys. No places for youth to gather and dream of escape. Just the road through town, quick enough to miss in a blink, like a dream you cant quite remember come morning. The town endured, neither dying nor truly living, suspended in the humid air like a peach not yet ready to fall.",
            "The street runs between two highways like a vein between arteries, carrying the lifeblood of traffic past our house that stands sentinel at the corner where the pavement bends. Tennessee. Small town. The kind of place where folk dont come and go much anymore, like the world done forgot about it somehow. We watch them all from here, me and the wife and the two girls, eleven and fourteen, watching through windows like pale ghosts in a house that's become our world entire.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out before us like some dying thing, houses scattered among trees that was here long before any of us. Folk go about their business like they always have. Mowing grass till the machines sound like theyre calling to one another across the yards, March through October when the grass finally yields to the coming cold. Then the leaves begin their death march, drifting down in browns and reds till they carpet the ground and we burn them, the smoke rising up like prayers in the autumn air.\n\nWinter ain't what it used to be. More like autumn that won't die, hanging on past its time. The children still find their way down the hill on sleds when the snow comes, which ain't often anymore. Most days its just bikes and dogs and walkers moving through the street like specters in some half-remembered dream.\n\nThe garage stands at the back of the house where I work on my truck, doors open to the world like wounds. Front door might as well be sealed shut for all we use it. Holidays bring the strangers, cars lined up and down the street like mourners at a wake. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and they go and the street returns to its silence.\n\nSometimes we cook out back, smoke rising from the grill like signals to whoever might be watching. Sometimes we play in the rain, the water washing away whatever sins we might have gathered. But mostly we just watch. Watch the cars pass, watch the seasons change, watch the neighbors move through their lives like actors in some great theater we cant quite understand. This street, this life, this endless procession of days. It'd be perfect if it weren't for the traffic. But nothing's perfect anymore. Maybe it never was.",
            "The land stretches out brown and dead, nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. Dirt and more dirt still. Nobody knows what it means less they lived here, less they woke each morning to that vast brown emptiness, the rare patch of green lawn standing like some rich man's mockery of nature itself. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart, scattered like bones across the waste. Still do mostly, though new structures rise up now, civilization creeping in slow but steady like some horrid tide.\n\nPlace grows more citified with each passing season though that's the way of things everywhere now. Folk here are kindly enough but like anywhere there's good and there's bad and there's worse. My patch is ringed with old folk, friendly enough, marking this as one of the better places though that don't mean much. The stores are all them chain operations. Food For Less. Smart and Final. Nothing fancy. You want that kind of thing you got to travel and even then.\n\nConstruction work's what keeps most alive out here. Not from reading no statistics but from watching. Makes sense with all this empty space waiting to be filled. That thought sits in my gut like a stone. Left the big city to get away from all that. Now I work construction myself, hanging drywall and ceiling bars, watching the spread of it.\n\nBut it's the animals make this place what it is. Folk come here for different reasons but mainly it's the stark beauty of it, the challenge of it. Desert's got its own rules, its own way of being. Got creatures living here can't live nowhere else. Human folk best learn to live alongside em proper. My young ones took to it natural. Even now they're out there hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen, learning the ways of this hard land.\n\nTown's got its attractions if you want em. County fair comes through regular. Folks head up to Wrightwood when they need to see snow, learn to slide down mountains for sport. Museum's got old bones and Indian things, tells how this place came to be what it is. But that ain't what matters. What matters is the desert itself, vast and empty, waiting patient as stone while we scurry bout building our little lives atop it, temporary as morning dew.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete labyrinth. Gray and godless. He reckons it his neighborhood though he knows such words mean little now. Not like the neighborhoods of old where families dwelt in their separate houses and children played in streets now long dead and gone.\n\nThe buildings rise up like ancient monoliths. Three kinds there are. The apartments first, stacked two stories high with their identical windows staring out blind and dark. Twenty souls perhaps in each one, though he cannot be sure. Then the houses proper, scattered few and far between, where the old guard dwells. Alumni they're called, though such words mean little now. And last the dormitories, great concrete hives where hundreds sleep two by two in cells no bigger than prison holds.\n\nThe people here are of all kinds and colors, though that matters little now. The elders keep to their houses while the young ones crowd the dorms and the ones between take the apartments. Like some great sorting of souls, each to their designated place in this concrete purgatory.\n\nThere are stores too, though they ain't like the stores of old. Places to eat and places to buy clothes marked with symbols of learning. A single park remains, kept clean by some unspoken covenant among those who dwell here. At night it lies empty and dark, the swings creaking soft in the wind like hanging men.\n\nHe studies it all through eyes grown tired of looking. This is his neighborhood now, this place of learning and waiting. Self-contained and sealed off from the world beyond like some great ark adrift on a sea of asphalt and concrete. He knows no other home now. Knows too that home is just a word, like neighborhood, like community. Words that mean less with each passing day.\n\nBut still they persist here, all of them, in their concrete caves and their borrowed beds. Still they wake each morning and go about their rituals of learning, as if such things still matter in a world grown strange and cold. Perhaps they do. Perhaps this is all that's left to them now. This place. These people. This neighborhood that ain't really a neighborhood at all.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward from where the house stands like some ancient sentinel at the peak of what they call the workout hill, though there aint nothing about exercise in its nature. Just gravity and the weight of things. Folk walk in the road cause there aint no choice about it. The pavement's broke and scarred like an old fighter's face, pocked with holes that'll tear the heart out of any vehicle daring enough to pass. Above it all hang the wires, patched and mended like a vagrant's coat, victims of countless storms that rake through here regular as grief. The repairmen come and go and the wires get uglier.\n\nTrees rise up everywhere. Tall evergreens that folk hate cause they block the view of the water. They cut em down with a vengeance born of greed, building their glass houses higher and higher, reaching up like drowning men for a glimpse of the bay. At sunset the water burns like molten copper but mostly its hidden behind clouds thick as wool blankets, the light filtering through like some weak memory of brightness. The damp claims everything here. Moss creeps across the world like a plague, turning roofs and cars and metal to green fur. Left my own vehicle out once and nature took it back, took three hours of scraping to reclaim it from the green.\n\nAint many children. Just old folk waiting out their days, and dogs. Dogs everywhere, running wild and free, sneaking into houses like thieves through any door left open by the careless. Found one in my living room once, staring at me like I was the intruder. The rabbits too, big as cats some of them, tearing up gardens till my cats hunted em down. Birds pass through - sparrows, hummingbirds small as thoughts, and sometimes a hawk floating overhead till the crows drive it off like some dark army protecting their territory.\n\nDown by the water there's places to eat what the bay provides, though there aint much beach to speak of. Just rocks for throwing into the gray water. The opposite shore sits out there in the mist like some dream of civilization, close enough to see but too far to touch. Just watching and waiting while the fog rolls in.",
            "They say Bensonhurst aint hard to find. The trains come and go like metal serpents through the concrete canyons of Brooklyn, carrying souls worn thin by the city's weight. The streets lay dark and solemn beneath perpetual sheets of gray sky.\n\nThe neighborhood bears its own particular darkness. Not the darkness of empty places but the darkness of too many souls pressed together in weathered buildings that stand like tired sentinels. Asian letters flash their neon promises from every storefront, marking territory claimed over decades past. Supermarkets and laundromats line the streets like prayer beads on a rosary, each one identical to the last, each one necessary as breath.\n\nWhere I stand now there are four markets within sight of each other, their windows fogged with steam and voices speaking in tongues I do not know. The people here are pilgrims all, first and second sons of immigrants seeking something they cannot name. The businesses belong mostly to the Asians now, their industry as relentless as the tide.\n\nThey built a park nearby. Ten courts for basketball where children play their endless games. Soccer fields stretch out like dead grass seas. Handball courts stand silent as tombs until filled with the echo of rubber balls and young voices. A fountain spits water in summer months, blessing the children with temporary baptism.\n\nThe buildings here are low and humble. No glass towers reach for God. Just homes stacked two deep where families weather the long nights. Music bleeds from passing cars like wounds, engines roar their defiance at the dawn. Nights bring their own particular terrors. The streets grow teeth. Men with hollow eyes seek prey among the shadows.\n\nI knew their violence once. Felt fists against flesh, learned the taste of blood and fear. Now thieves hunt packages left on stoops like carrion birds. And everywhere the dogs leave their offerings, ignored by masters who have forgotten the meaning of civilization. The city fines mean nothing here where law is just a whisper carried away by wind.\n\nWatch your step in Bensonhurst. The concrete remembers everything it has seen.",
            "You got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon fore you can understand the place itself. Written up on some building that serves pizza and liquor and flesh and music and probably breaks half dozen laws doing it are the words Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say its bout remembering the old days when the city wasnt so known and wasnt so dear and folk could make something different of themselves here. Others hear it like a calling. Come to Portland theyd say. We'll call you weird here too but we'll mean it kind.\n\nThe Californians came with their money and their condos rose like concrete weeds from the earth but Portland stayed weird all the same. Not that weird means kind exactly. More like accepting things others wont accept. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere else in this godforsaken country. Weird aint about that.\n\nIn my part of town the houses stand painted in colors that'd make a carnival jealous. Gardens growing wild with herbs and flowers pressing up through cracks in the sidewalk like nature trying to take back whats hers. And there's them free boxes. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic. Like offerings to whatever gods still care to look down on us. Books and clothes mostly but could be anything. Something bout walking these streets in Southeast makes you believe in magic again. Least thats how I see it but Im just one kind of weird in this city of thousands.\n\nSome folk wouldnt touch nothing from a sidewalk box. They do their yoga with goats. Yes real goats. Or they go watch them Timbers kick a ball round a field. Portland's got all kinds. Dreamers and drunks and them that cant tell the difference no more.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray and constant like God crying. Brings the darkness in peoples minds. We got drugs here sure. Got homeless too. More than most places cause we try to help em but we dont help enough. Never enough. The rest of us we care bout em or we hate em depending on the day. In that we aint weird at all. Just human. Poor sorry humans same as anywhere else.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel. Always there in the north, bearing witness to the coming and going of light like some ancient gods carved from stone. A man might forget them in the daily toil of existence but they remain, unmoved and unchanging, like thoughts in the mind of God. When the weight of living becomes too much they call out with their silence and a man might look upon them and find some measure of peace in their permanence.\n\nI came here first as a young man. The university stretched out below them peaks like some congregation before an altar. Fine buildings there were and pools of water reflecting the sky and trees that had stood longer than any man's memory but it was them mountains that held dominion over all. The town beneath grew like weeds in the shadow of stone. Coffee houses with their bitter smell where young folk bent over books in the small hours. The downtown with its old brick worn smooth by time and weather, buildings pressed together like folk huddled against the cold. For them few blocks it was like some greater city had sprouted up out of the quiet earth but that feeling passed quick as it came once you walked past the library.\n\nMemories collect in such places like water in a basin. Some sweet and some bitter. Walking with friends past playground swings gone to rust in the darkness after studying all night. Running through crowded streets to catch some picture show in that fancy theater. But there were darker times too. Sitting by them ponds at two in the morning watching ducks and turtles going about their business while inside your head the darkness grows. Watching them creatures each with their purpose while your own seems lost in the vastness of living.\n\nSo I walked. Past the pond and the park and them little houses all lined up neat like graves. When I reached the main road the sun was coming up, painting everything in fire and shadow. Palm trees stood like sentries and above it all them mountains remained. Cutting into that fire-touched sky like they had done since before man walked upright. And something in that permanence spoke without speaking. Some truth older than words about carrying on. About enduring.",
            "You wouldnt see it at first passing. Just retail facades and empty lots where folk once shopped for organic produce and whatnot. But beyond the dead Whole Foods and past them hotels that only breathe life when summer brings the reunions of blood kin, there's a whole world moving and breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like great concrete monoliths laid out in perfect succession, each one watching the other in some kind of architectural vigil. First ones got darkness in their history. Best leave them be. Truth aint always what papers tell.\n\nBeyond these stands another world. Silent. Unknown to most. College buildings squatting low against the earth, students dragging themselves through iron gates that screech like dying things in the dawn light. Traffic backed up while morning folk curse from their vehicles, their words lost in the heavy air.\n\nRoad ends at a T, park on one side and them bone-mending folks on the other. Their porch with its wicker chairs and that ceiling fan turning slow circles in air thick as molasses. Children spinning themselves through the grass like gyroscopes while bees work the flowers growing wild by the roadside. Old ones walking their dogs, eyeing the young ones on their boards with suspicion born of years. Girls gather like birds on playground metal, speaking secrets about boys and whatever moving pictures light up their phones these days.\n\nStrip mall stands sentinel. Sushi joint never full but keeping on somehow. Swimming store. Nail place. All of it lined up neat like artifacts in some museum of modern living. Frozen yogurt spot drawing them young ones like moths, their cups sweating in the heat while they show off on wheels and breathe sweet smoke into the heavy air, thinking themselves immortal.\n\nThis here's a piece of the old south. Time moves different here. Like molasses in winter. Everything preserved in amber, waiting. Just waiting.",
            "The houses stood like ancient sentinels. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still in their weathered communion. Small yards stretched before them and narrow drives lay alongside like pale wounds in the earth. They spoke of times past when suburban living was the dream that held this country in its grip but that dream was loosening now like a rope worn thin by time and weather. Yet these neighborhoods persisted. Called out their testament to any who'd listen that the dream hadnt died entirely.\n\nThe people walked different now. Less hope in their step. Yards gone wild where once they'd been kept pristine but still the cars sat in drives two by two like creatures waiting for the flood. Children played in the streets as if the world ended at its borders. The school stood ninety years strong conjuring futures in the young while stirring ghosts in the old. Churches sparse and empty but the basketball courts filled with life and motion. Houses different as thumbprints but kindred somehow in their bones.\n\nSuper A they called it. Run by Yemenis, perhaps the only Arab folk for miles in this sea of black faces. Streets wide as rivers where children played their games, scattering like starlings when cars approached. Folk here could trace their blood back generations in this place. Tell tales of when neighbor knew neighbor like kin.\n\nWhere once stood a karate school now stood a pharmacy. Dreams of martial glory faded with the moving pictures that spawned them. Pills took their place. The old theatre still showed its ancient reels, saved from crowds by young folk's scorn but blessed by the elders who found comfort in its dimness, away from children's eyes.\n\nA single highway passed through but never touched ground here. Young ones wanted an exit built but the elders knew better. Knew that progress was just another word for death. They were building a new school now. Talking of mascots. Some spoke of a mechanical man with a country drawl and a cabin of logs. But in this place nothing was ever truly new. Just old things wearing different faces.",
            "The city sprawls vast and merciless before him. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a gray sky that holds neither promise nor redemption. Streets wind through the maze of steel and glass, some bearing names in foreign tongues - Koreatown, Little Armenia - each a world sealed within itself. Traffic moves like blood through clogged arteries, two hours to traverse ten miles, the vehicles packed together in mindless congregation.\n\nHe studies the neighborhood from his window. Orthodox Jews in black coats moving like shadows through the morning light. Soviet refugees carrying their histories like wounds that won't heal. Rainbow flags hanging limp in windows, testaments to loves that dare speak their names. All of them moving through the same dead space, breathing the same tired air.\n\nThe parks stand like green islands in the concrete sea. Children play there still, their voices carrying across time itself, reminiscent of days when he too ran wild with the neighbor boy, before the world grew cold and strange. Now neighbors pass like ghosts, nameless, faceless, sealed behind walls and doors that never open.\n\nConstruction cranes loom against the horizon like ancient siege machines. New towers rising, steel bones reaching skyward, while below the streets grow more congested, more choked with each passing season. Parking spaces become rare as gold. The city devours itself and grows hungry still.\n\nHouses crouch between the towers - single homes, duplexes, small apartment blocks - each one a universe unto itself. Some dating back to times when people still knew their neighbors' names, when communities weren't just words in real estate listings. But those days are gone now, gone like smoke in the wind, like all things must go.\n\nThe streets fill and empty, fill and empty, an endless tide of humanity washing through the concrete canyons. Each soul carrying its own story, its own burden, moving through the vastness alone. The city holds them all, indifferent as God, while the sun wheels overhead in a sky the color of beaten lead.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn. This is it, I told her. She'd never known such emptiness, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The corn stretched out beyond sight, row upon row like soldiers in formation, waiting. I told her bout growing up here in Ohio country, watching recognition dawn in her eyes like the slow light of morning.\n\nPast the water-filled quarry the houses rose up from the earth, brick and stucco set back from the road on half-acre plots tended like holy ground. Spring brought forth flowers planted by hands that knew the seasons, knew the trees that died and lived again with each turn of the year. Mercedes machines gleamed in driveways like chrome beasts drinking the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived three houses down, always outside, always singing above his mower's drone. Doctor once, they said. Now just a man who'd lost pieces of himself to time, melding with the grass and his green John Deere like some strange hybrid creature born of lawn and machine.\n\nOur house stood grey against grey sky. Geese claimed the side yard til the terrier drove them off. Behind lay the stream that fed the quarry, carrying bullfrog song and cattle lowing from distant pastures. Cross the wooden bridge we built with our hands and you'd find yourself in untamed country. Wild flowers and herbs grew there among trees that knew no master.\n\nThis was where childhood lived. Where we built fortresses in trees and stalked imaginary prey. Where neighborhood children appeared like spirits through the brush, companions in our wild games.\n\nWinter came hard and merciless but brought its own terrible beauty. The yard transformed from living green to dead white wilderness. Trees that once bloomed pink and purple stood naked now, their dark bones reaching toward leaden sky. Snow came in the night like judgment, covering all. My sister's angels lay scattered in drifts while snowmen stood sentinel. We warred with packed ice, building frozen ramparts to shield our arsenal of winter weapons. Here in our sealed white world we played at life while real life waited somewhere beyond the fields, beyond the corn, beyond our knowing. We were children then. We knew nothing of what waited."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This land aint got no gleaming towers nor the bright lights of commerce that other folk speak of. Just farmland stretching out like a tired blanket til it meets them tourist towns. No malls here. No Walmarts. No chain restaurants with their neon signs blazing against the night sky. Everything you need is a drive away through the empty country.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold something ancient and true. Two lakes lap at the edges of our town like giant mirrors laid flat against the earth. Lake Michigan to one side vast and cold, Lake Charlevoix to the other. Everywhere you turn theres sand waiting for bare feet, water waiting to swallow your reflection.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old soldiers who've seen too much. Aint no matching faces here. Each one tells its own story. Some got fresh paint and new windows, others wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see from the road, dug deep into the Michigan clay. Aluminum siding gone gray with time covers most, colors faded like old photographs left in the sun.\n\nChildren run wild in the streets like scattered birds. Dogs tug at their leashes. Bikes leave thin trails in the dust. Folk here know each other. Know who belongs and who dont. They wave from their grills, smoke rising up like prayers. They nod as they pass, dogs padding alongside.\n\nThe yards stay trim, grass cut low like a military haircut. No dead leaves allowed to gather and rot. Plants stand in neat rows like prisoners. Its not beautiful in the way that makes people stop and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes them want to stay. Safe. Quiet. Like the world before it went wrong.\n\nThe jail squats at the edge of town, gray and watchful. The health department beside it like some kind of promise. Planes drone overhead from the small airport, their shadows crossing yards where baseball games echo from nearby fields. The recycling center hums its own quiet song of preservation.\n\nIce cream can be had by foot, and downtown aint far if youre of a mind to walk it. Children pedal their bikes to the park like pilgrims to a shrine, eight blocks through the heart of what we call home. This here's a place where the world still makes sense. Where people can still find their way back to what matters. A place where the day ends soft and quiet, like a prayer whispered in the dark.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in the dead heat of morning. Row upon row of them identical and stark against the pallid sky. No variation in their countenance save what the homeowners association would permit in their godlike governance of such things. Small patches of grass lay before each dwelling trimmed and manicured like cemetery plots. Gravel beds with their decorative stones bleached white in the sun. The driveways short and perfect leading to garages that could shelter two vehicles and nothing more.\n\nThey'd paved these roads not long past. Fresh concrete unmarred by time or neglect stretched out before you like a river of bone. No potholes here. No imperfection that might speak to the passage of years or the weight of vehicles gone before. Some dwellings rose two stories tall but most crouched low against the earth as if wary of drawing attention to themselves.\n\nThe mailboxes stood gathered at the street's end like prisoners awaiting judgment. Not separate markers for each home as you might expect but a congregation of metal boxes bound together, each secured by its own key. Two larger chambers for parcels that might come. The association had ordained it thus and so it remained.\n\nAt the city's edge where suburban order gave way to rural chaos the neighborhood sprawled vast and purposeful. Swimming pools lay behind iron gates available to any who lived here and could prove their belonging. Walking paths wound through the emptiness like the tracks of ancient creatures long extinct. You could walk your dog there or take evening constitutional without need of designated parkland. The retired folk who made up most of the population would watch from their windows, guardians of this manufactured peace. Young professionals moved among them like ghosts, outnumbered but tolerated.\n\nThe city itself lay fifteen minutes distant by automobile, a sprawling thing that somehow maintained its small-town pretense. One mall stood there, neither grand nor humble but sufficient to its purpose. Markets of various persuasion lined the streets from the organic temples of the wealthy to the bare-bones outlets where the poor sought sustenance.\n\nThis was a place of safety and order. A place where man had imposed his will upon the landscape and called it good. The swimming pools gleamed like blind eyes in the sun. The walking trails wound their way through carefully managed wilderness. And all of it lay just far enough from commerce to maintain its isolation while remaining within reach of every chain store and market that modern life demanded. This was civilization's compromise with chaos, and it endured.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished. Strange thing to hear in a city where folk paid thousands just to lay their heads. None I knew spoke of such tales. Maybe it's the weight of living crushing down. Some nights you hear the sobbing through the walls, through the floors. Folk learn to scrape by. Learn to love the smell of other people's castoffs, mothballed clothes and broken toys laid out on folding tables in the dust. The smell of youth dies quiet. Some take to smoking. Some just forget what clean air tastes like. But the flea market smell, it stays. Settles in like death. Smells like forgotten magazines yellowing on a dead piano. Gets in the leather and wont wash out no matter what you do.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking. Start at the far end, you can work your way through two charity shops, the library with its musty books, rare book dealer, curio shop with its shelves of dead men's treasures. Downtown's thick with bodies and machines, morning till night, but step inside them stores and the world goes quiet as a tomb. Good place to lose yourself. More of them coming every year, the bodies and machines. Growing city, they say. Some big company dealing in clicks and packages made its home here. Like New York in a way. Everyone got their own heading, don't nobody ask much of you. Can keep to yourself, quiet-like, independent. Not like down South where caring means prying. Here you can keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like waves on a dead shore.\n\nLife still moves though. Got a piano player next door, couple singers upstairs always working their scales. Less strangers sharing walls than a kind of family. Come together when needs must. Share the birthdays, the funerals, the hard times. Lucky in a way. Most of them treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. Trade favors like mail delivery. See them smile when I pass and think maybe they're glad of me like I'm glad of them. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but it's them makes me think I ain't totally lost my way after all.",
            "The town lies just beyond where the city's reach ends. A small place. Midwestern. We live on the east side where the poorest folk dwell in homes worth little more than kindling. Rental signs stand like sentries on grassless yards. But there aint no ugliness here like you might expect. Folk still nod and speak when you pass. They remember such things.\n\nViolence visits sometimes like an unwelcome relative that wont leave. Gunshots in the night. Blood on sidewalks. The neighbors boy got killed outside some bar last year. His mother still sits on that porch watching nothing. We lost a few things left outside but nothing more. The real killer here is that white powder. Fentanyl. It takes them quick and quiet. Town's got places for them that want help. Teaching folks how to bring the dead back with that Narcan. Some make it. Most dont.\n\nThe boy goes to school where they treat him right despite his differences. Good people there. Teachers that still care about such things. Parents meeting regular to plan things for the children. More than twenty of every hundred here cant feed their own so the school feeds em all. Breakfast and lunch. No child marked for being poor.\n\nThe council men build their gardens and fix their roads but mostly in the middle of town or the west side where the money lives. East side gets forgotten like an old dog under the porch. But we been here sixteen years in this little house that aint worth much but keeps the rain out. Stores enough to get by. Good people mostly. Cant imagine being nowhere else though sometimes at night I hear them shots and wonder if the devil aint living here too somewhere in them shadows.",
            "The neighborhood rises like some ancient beast from the belly of the city, its spine a ridge of weathered buildings crowned with histories dark and deep. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater stands sentinel, its marquee dead and silent now like the eyes of something long buried. Down the slope there's a place where folk gather when the nights turn warm, an arcade bar they call it, though it bears little resemblance to the penny arcades of old. They queue there in the summer months, June and July mostly, standing patient and solemn like mourners at some perpetual wake.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast and empty save for the concrete that rings it like a collar, steps carved into its throat like the marks of some ancient ceremony. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents arrayed in rows precise as headstones. Rain comes more often than snow, beating against canvas like nature's own dirge. They huddle close, these wanderers, seeking warmth in numbers, closer to the heart of things than out there in what they call the jungle. The family center stands like a beacon, offering water and soap and brief moments of dignity.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks to me, nor them proud old buildings that march down toward the sea. It's the people carrying their histories like scripture. Hilltop, they say, was once mean as a rattler, gang violence flowing through its streets like poison. Federal men came through with their badges and guns, sweeping clean what couldn't be cleaned. The stories persist, passed down like dark gospels, mother to child, stranger to stranger.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens, though outsiders still speak of danger. White folk, they say, best clear out after dark. But that's just echoes, old fears speaking with dead tongues. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass, or maybe Hilltop knows its own - them that understand how fear and ignorance breed like rats in the walls of this supposed melting pot paradise.\n\nThis is home now. These streets know me like I know them. Strangers offer warmth more often than harm. The laundry woman keeps her lights burning when the rain comes horizontal and mean. I've sat against cold concrete, thinking myself invisible as ash, only to have some passerby reach down with a five-dollar bill and words sweet as scripture: you're beautiful, they say, you're valuable. And in this place, in this moment, it rings true as gospel.",
            "They came to this place when he was thirteen summers old, before the boy had learned the ways of men. The houses stood like sentinels, two stories tall and identical in their suburban uniformity, stretched out along the asphalt road that wound through the development like a black river. The boy had no friends then but time brought him two companions, one who lived two doors down and another who dwelt further along the street. Both gone now but their ghosts remained.\n\nThe neighborhood stood unchanged. Like some photograph yellowed with age but preserved in its essence. Children's voices carried on the warm wind whenever the sun showed itself, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. Most days the streets lay quiet. No quarrels with neighbors. No strife. A place where solitude was respected save when aid was needed. Packages left on porches remained untouched, as if protected by some unspoken covenant between the dwellers of this place.\n\nThere was a park. Not more than a hundred yards distant. A place of memories both blessed and cursed. Where basketballs had arced through summer evenings and footballs spiraled against gray autumn skies. Where blood had flowed from the boy's nose one cold afternoon, crimson drops staining white winter ground. Now he brought his cousin's children there, watching them swing and slide in their innocent joy, their excitement pure and untainted by time's passing.\n\nThe streets around teemed with the foods of many nations. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All within walking distance though most now summoned their sustenance through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints squatted on corners like gargoyles, identical to those in every other suburb in this vast land. Pizza parlors too, their red signs glowing in the dusk.\n\nStores lined the streets like trading posts of old. Dry cleaners. Drug stores facing each other across the road like duelists. A grocery store bearing a name known only to those who dwelled in these northern territories. And there was the Indian store, its shelves stocked with spices and strange grains, preserved foods in jars like specimens in some exotic museum.\n\nHe thought of other neighborhoods he'd read about. Places where darkness dwelt in men's hearts and evil walked abroad in daylight. This place was not like those. Here was peace of a sort. Here was home.",
            "The college stands near where I live, a blessing of sorts in this godless stretch of urban decay. Apartment buildings rise like ancient monoliths against a gray sky, their facades weathered and worn by time's merciless march. Between them stand the bars and eateries where the young gather, counting their meager coins for watered-down spirits. One such establishment recently took on a new name, as if christening could wash away its sins of overpriced libations and indifferent service.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes: the students, temporary as morning frost, and the poor souls anchored by poverty to these crumbling walls. Children too, their voices carrying across concrete and asphalt from the schoolyard nearby. My neighbors remain strangers by choice, though their marijuana smoke seeps through walls like some spectral presence. Management's solution: a plastic box spewing artificial freshness, a joke told in the language of corporate impotence.\n\nDown the road stand new buildings, false promises wrapped in cheap materials and high rent. Their walls thin as playing cards, built by men who knew nothing of permanence. A restaurant serves microwaved sustenance on paper plates, a temple to disposable living. Beside it squats a gas station, where desperate men trade hours of their lives for dollars.\n\nThe city, in its infinite wisdom, laid new concrete paths and planted grass in strips, as if nature could be parceled and contained. My building hunkers beneath ancient trees, some now reduced to stumps like broken teeth in a dying mouth. Behind us lies 43rd Street, a darker reflection of our own, where cracked sidewalks spider-web beneath feet and buildings wear their shame openly. Crime blooms there like black mold, though it seeps across boundaries, respecting no borders we devise.\n\nYet I remain, tethered by economics and convenience to this place. The university stands within walking distance, and buses carry the carless to their destinations like modern-day ferrymen. This is my station now, among the concrete and the dying trees, in this purgatory between poverty and promise.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, their white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They'd built them to look separate but they wasnt. Folk gathered most evenings at the end of whatever drive suited them, speaking soft words while their young ones made chalk marks on the concrete or sent their kites up into that vast blue nothing. Like some forgotten time it was. A place where the mechanical world hadnt yet laid its cold hand.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up black against the sky where clouds moved like great white ships. But the weather it had turned. Last night the sirens came wailing through the darkness and we knew what was coming. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever treasures I thought to save while the big one paced the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles hitting the earth. When it was done the road steamed like some creature breathing its last and the temperature had dropped from ninety-two to seventy-five quick as a thought. The hail melted where it struck the burning pavement and then the sun broke through and the rain came again and with it two rainbows arced across the sky like some biblical covenant.\n\nThe houses stood quiet for a time after, till folk began to drift back from wherever they'd sheltered. Then it was like always. Women watching their young ones while dinner cooked inside. Different from New Hampshire this place was, forty minutes outside Charlotte where I'd come to rest. The southern voices soft and strange like music from another country. Two bedrooms and two baths in each unit though some were smaller inside than others which didnt make no sense but that's how it was.\n\nBehind the houses there was a pond where swimming wasnt allowed and I'd walk there sometimes seeing deer moving like ghosts through the morning mist while bullfrogs sang their ancient songs. Roosters called from the surrounding farms each dawn and sometimes in the evening a donkey would bray into the growing dark like he was telling the world he still drew breath. A good place it was. A place a body could call home.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Memory holds the move from Riverdale to Stockbridge like a photograph faded at the edges. Tears came then, for what was lost and what was loved, though mama and daddy had their reasons. Better schools they said. Better houses. Places where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nTime passed like water through fingers. Made friends and enemies both, though neighbors remained strangers save for Mr. Glen and Dennis living adjacent. Good folk. Like blood almost. Remember Mr. Glen's wedding clear as yesterday, him taking another wife. Caught the white garter when Ms. Veda sent it sailing through the lamplight. Danced with Marsharii that night, her face young and full of promise. Never saw her after. World swallows some whole.\n\nThe streets here wind like snakes in summer grass. GPS helps now but before it was just wandering. Me and Kason and Curtis, we'd lose ourselves in video games, in the simple pleasure of being young and alive. Sometimes I'd walk alone to the park where the trees stand sentinel. Brought sticks from the hardware store to practice balance, brought the wooden sword too. Something holy in that solitude.\n\nCourts there for basketball and tennis both, empty now but waiting. Daddy and Mr. Graves taught us tennis years back, worked us till our muscles burned and our hearts sang. Good times those were. Simple times.\n\nReckon there's more stories buried in these streets than I could tell in a day. But these are the ones that stick like burrs to the soul, that won't shake loose no matter how far you walk. And somewhere ahead the future waits, patient as stone, holding whatever comes next in its dark hands.",
            "Johnston lay there in the South Carolina heat like some forgotten outpost of civilization. A town that breathed peaches. The welcome sign proclaimed it proud, Peach Capital of the World, though the world had long since moved on from such declarations. Fields stretched out beyond sight, peach trees standing sentinel over the cattle that grazed in the spaces between. Houses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming under the merciless sun or gray shingles dulled by time and weather, each dwelling an island in the agricultural sea.\n\nThe town center nothing more than a single stoplight swaying in the wind at a fourway crossing, watching over the few establishments that clung to existence there. Hong Kong, run by a family whose story was never told. Fiesta Mexican. Gary's with its burgers. The pizzeria long gone now, its windows dark and empty like dead eyes. Maxwell and Halford Drug still poured cherry cola like some remnant of an older time. IGA stood charging prices that drove folk twenty miles to Batesburg-Leesville where the Walmart waited like some retail paradise.\n\nDollar General remained the heart of it all, its fluorescent pulse drawing people from sunup to sundown. Possibilities Furniture & More occupied its corner, the owner's kindness a currency more valuable than money, her two movers like disciples of her trade. Next door the pet groomer tended to the town's companions, washing and clipping away the dust of rural life.\n\nThe doctor and the vet practiced their arts in quiet buildings away from the center, treating the living things of Johnston with what tools they had. The elementary school stood alone, releasing its children to other towns once they grew too old for its walls. They were building a park now, two and a half acres of hope for a future that might never come.\n\nNo theaters here. No bowling alleys. No places for youth to gather and dream of escape. Just the road through town, quick enough to miss in a blink, like a dream you cant quite remember come morning. The town endured, neither dying nor truly living, suspended in the humid air like a peach not yet ready to fall.",
            "The street runs between two highways like a vein between arteries, carrying the lifeblood of traffic past our house that stands sentinel at the corner where the pavement bends. Tennessee. Small town. The kind of place where folk dont come and go much anymore, like the world done forgot about it somehow. We watch them all from here, me and the wife and the two girls, eleven and fourteen, watching through windows like pale ghosts in a house that's become our world entire.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out before us like some dying thing, houses scattered among trees that was here long before any of us. Folk go about their business like they always have. Mowing grass till the machines sound like theyre calling to one another across the yards, March through October when the grass finally yields to the coming cold. Then the leaves begin their death march, drifting down in browns and reds till they carpet the ground and we burn them, the smoke rising up like prayers in the autumn air.\n\nWinter ain't what it used to be. More like autumn that won't die, hanging on past its time. The children still find their way down the hill on sleds when the snow comes, which ain't often anymore. Most days its just bikes and dogs and walkers moving through the street like specters in some half-remembered dream.\n\nThe garage stands at the back of the house where I work on my truck, doors open to the world like wounds. Front door might as well be sealed shut for all we use it. Holidays bring the strangers, cars lined up and down the street like mourners at a wake. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and they go and the street returns to its silence.\n\nSometimes we cook out back, smoke rising from the grill like signals to whoever might be watching. Sometimes we play in the rain, the water washing away whatever sins we might have gathered. But mostly we just watch. Watch the cars pass, watch the seasons change, watch the neighbors move through their lives like actors in some great theater we cant quite understand. This street, this life, this endless procession of days. It'd be perfect if it weren't for the traffic. But nothing's perfect anymore. Maybe it never was.",
            "The land stretches out brown and dead, nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. Dirt and more dirt still. Nobody knows what it means less they lived here, less they woke each morning to that vast brown emptiness, the rare patch of green lawn standing like some rich man's mockery of nature itself. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart, scattered like bones across the waste. Still do mostly, though new structures rise up now, civilization creeping in slow but steady like some horrid tide.\n\nPlace grows more citified with each passing season though that's the way of things everywhere now. Folk here are kindly enough but like anywhere there's good and there's bad and there's worse. My patch is ringed with old folk, friendly enough, marking this as one of the better places though that don't mean much. The stores are all them chain operations. Food For Less. Smart and Final. Nothing fancy. You want that kind of thing you got to travel and even then.\n\nConstruction work's what keeps most alive out here. Not from reading no statistics but from watching. Makes sense with all this empty space waiting to be filled. That thought sits in my gut like a stone. Left the big city to get away from all that. Now I work construction myself, hanging drywall and ceiling bars, watching the spread of it.\n\nBut it's the animals make this place what it is. Folk come here for different reasons but mainly it's the stark beauty of it, the challenge of it. Desert's got its own rules, its own way of being. Got creatures living here can't live nowhere else. Human folk best learn to live alongside em proper. My young ones took to it natural. Even now they're out there hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen, learning the ways of this hard land.\n\nTown's got its attractions if you want em. County fair comes through regular. Folks head up to Wrightwood when they need to see snow, learn to slide down mountains for sport. Museum's got old bones and Indian things, tells how this place came to be what it is. But that ain't what matters. What matters is the desert itself, vast and empty, waiting patient as stone while we scurry bout building our little lives atop it, temporary as morning dew.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete labyrinth. Gray and godless. He reckons it his neighborhood though he knows such words mean little now. Not like the neighborhoods of old where families dwelt in their separate houses and children played in streets now long dead and gone.\n\nThe buildings rise up like ancient monoliths. Three kinds there are. The apartments first, stacked two stories high with their identical windows staring out blind and dark. Twenty souls perhaps in each one, though he cannot be sure. Then the houses proper, scattered few and far between, where the old guard dwells. Alumni they're called, though such words mean little now. And last the dormitories, great concrete hives where hundreds sleep two by two in cells no bigger than prison holds.\n\nThe people here are of all kinds and colors, though that matters little now. The elders keep to their houses while the young ones crowd the dorms and the ones between take the apartments. Like some great sorting of souls, each to their designated place in this concrete purgatory.\n\nThere are stores too, though they ain't like the stores of old. Places to eat and places to buy clothes marked with symbols of learning. A single park remains, kept clean by some unspoken covenant among those who dwell here. At night it lies empty and dark, the swings creaking soft in the wind like hanging men.\n\nHe studies it all through eyes grown tired of looking. This is his neighborhood now, this place of learning and waiting. Self-contained and sealed off from the world beyond like some great ark adrift on a sea of asphalt and concrete. He knows no other home now. Knows too that home is just a word, like neighborhood, like community. Words that mean less with each passing day.\n\nBut still they persist here, all of them, in their concrete caves and their borrowed beds. Still they wake each morning and go about their rituals of learning, as if such things still matter in a world grown strange and cold. Perhaps they do. Perhaps this is all that's left to them now. This place. These people. This neighborhood that ain't really a neighborhood at all.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward from where the house stands like some ancient sentinel at the peak of what they call the workout hill, though there aint nothing about exercise in its nature. Just gravity and the weight of things. Folk walk in the road cause there aint no choice about it. The pavement's broke and scarred like an old fighter's face, pocked with holes that'll tear the heart out of any vehicle daring enough to pass. Above it all hang the wires, patched and mended like a vagrant's coat, victims of countless storms that rake through here regular as grief. The repairmen come and go and the wires get uglier.\n\nTrees rise up everywhere. Tall evergreens that folk hate cause they block the view of the water. They cut em down with a vengeance born of greed, building their glass houses higher and higher, reaching up like drowning men for a glimpse of the bay. At sunset the water burns like molten copper but mostly its hidden behind clouds thick as wool blankets, the light filtering through like some weak memory of brightness. The damp claims everything here. Moss creeps across the world like a plague, turning roofs and cars and metal to green fur. Left my own vehicle out once and nature took it back, took three hours of scraping to reclaim it from the green.\n\nAint many children. Just old folk waiting out their days, and dogs. Dogs everywhere, running wild and free, sneaking into houses like thieves through any door left open by the careless. Found one in my living room once, staring at me like I was the intruder. The rabbits too, big as cats some of them, tearing up gardens till my cats hunted em down. Birds pass through - sparrows, hummingbirds small as thoughts, and sometimes a hawk floating overhead till the crows drive it off like some dark army protecting their territory.\n\nDown by the water there's places to eat what the bay provides, though there aint much beach to speak of. Just rocks for throwing into the gray water. The opposite shore sits out there in the mist like some dream of civilization, close enough to see but too far to touch. Just watching and waiting while the fog rolls in.",
            "They say Bensonhurst aint hard to find. The trains come and go like metal serpents through the concrete canyons of Brooklyn, carrying souls worn thin by the city's weight. The streets lay dark and solemn beneath perpetual sheets of gray sky.\n\nThe neighborhood bears its own particular darkness. Not the darkness of empty places but the darkness of too many souls pressed together in weathered buildings that stand like tired sentinels. Asian letters flash their neon promises from every storefront, marking territory claimed over decades past. Supermarkets and laundromats line the streets like prayer beads on a rosary, each one identical to the last, each one necessary as breath.\n\nWhere I stand now there are four markets within sight of each other, their windows fogged with steam and voices speaking in tongues I do not know. The people here are pilgrims all, first and second sons of immigrants seeking something they cannot name. The businesses belong mostly to the Asians now, their industry as relentless as the tide.\n\nThey built a park nearby. Ten courts for basketball where children play their endless games. Soccer fields stretch out like dead grass seas. Handball courts stand silent as tombs until filled with the echo of rubber balls and young voices. A fountain spits water in summer months, blessing the children with temporary baptism.\n\nThe buildings here are low and humble. No glass towers reach for God. Just homes stacked two deep where families weather the long nights. Music bleeds from passing cars like wounds, engines roar their defiance at the dawn. Nights bring their own particular terrors. The streets grow teeth. Men with hollow eyes seek prey among the shadows.\n\nI knew their violence once. Felt fists against flesh, learned the taste of blood and fear. Now thieves hunt packages left on stoops like carrion birds. And everywhere the dogs leave their offerings, ignored by masters who have forgotten the meaning of civilization. The city fines mean nothing here where law is just a whisper carried away by wind.\n\nWatch your step in Bensonhurst. The concrete remembers everything it has seen.",
            "You got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon fore you can understand the place itself. Written up on some building that serves pizza and liquor and flesh and music and probably breaks half dozen laws doing it are the words Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say its bout remembering the old days when the city wasnt so known and wasnt so dear and folk could make something different of themselves here. Others hear it like a calling. Come to Portland theyd say. We'll call you weird here too but we'll mean it kind.\n\nThe Californians came with their money and their condos rose like concrete weeds from the earth but Portland stayed weird all the same. Not that weird means kind exactly. More like accepting things others wont accept. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere else in this godforsaken country. Weird aint about that.\n\nIn my part of town the houses stand painted in colors that'd make a carnival jealous. Gardens growing wild with herbs and flowers pressing up through cracks in the sidewalk like nature trying to take back whats hers. And there's them free boxes. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic. Like offerings to whatever gods still care to look down on us. Books and clothes mostly but could be anything. Something bout walking these streets in Southeast makes you believe in magic again. Least thats how I see it but Im just one kind of weird in this city of thousands.\n\nSome folk wouldnt touch nothing from a sidewalk box. They do their yoga with goats. Yes real goats. Or they go watch them Timbers kick a ball round a field. Portland's got all kinds. Dreamers and drunks and them that cant tell the difference no more.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray and constant like God crying. Brings the darkness in peoples minds. We got drugs here sure. Got homeless too. More than most places cause we try to help em but we dont help enough. Never enough. The rest of us we care bout em or we hate em depending on the day. In that we aint weird at all. Just human. Poor sorry humans same as anywhere else.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel. Always there in the north, bearing witness to the coming and going of light like some ancient gods carved from stone. A man might forget them in the daily toil of existence but they remain, unmoved and unchanging, like thoughts in the mind of God. When the weight of living becomes too much they call out with their silence and a man might look upon them and find some measure of peace in their permanence.\n\nI came here first as a young man. The university stretched out below them peaks like some congregation before an altar. Fine buildings there were and pools of water reflecting the sky and trees that had stood longer than any man's memory but it was them mountains that held dominion over all. The town beneath grew like weeds in the shadow of stone. Coffee houses with their bitter smell where young folk bent over books in the small hours. The downtown with its old brick worn smooth by time and weather, buildings pressed together like folk huddled against the cold. For them few blocks it was like some greater city had sprouted up out of the quiet earth but that feeling passed quick as it came once you walked past the library.\n\nMemories collect in such places like water in a basin. Some sweet and some bitter. Walking with friends past playground swings gone to rust in the darkness after studying all night. Running through crowded streets to catch some picture show in that fancy theater. But there were darker times too. Sitting by them ponds at two in the morning watching ducks and turtles going about their business while inside your head the darkness grows. Watching them creatures each with their purpose while your own seems lost in the vastness of living.\n\nSo I walked. Past the pond and the park and them little houses all lined up neat like graves. When I reached the main road the sun was coming up, painting everything in fire and shadow. Palm trees stood like sentries and above it all them mountains remained. Cutting into that fire-touched sky like they had done since before man walked upright. And something in that permanence spoke without speaking. Some truth older than words about carrying on. About enduring.",
            "You wouldnt see it at first passing. Just retail facades and empty lots where folk once shopped for organic produce and whatnot. But beyond the dead Whole Foods and past them hotels that only breathe life when summer brings the reunions of blood kin, there's a whole world moving and breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like great concrete monoliths laid out in perfect succession, each one watching the other in some kind of architectural vigil. First ones got darkness in their history. Best leave them be. Truth aint always what papers tell.\n\nBeyond these stands another world. Silent. Unknown to most. College buildings squatting low against the earth, students dragging themselves through iron gates that screech like dying things in the dawn light. Traffic backed up while morning folk curse from their vehicles, their words lost in the heavy air.\n\nRoad ends at a T, park on one side and them bone-mending folks on the other. Their porch with its wicker chairs and that ceiling fan turning slow circles in air thick as molasses. Children spinning themselves through the grass like gyroscopes while bees work the flowers growing wild by the roadside. Old ones walking their dogs, eyeing the young ones on their boards with suspicion born of years. Girls gather like birds on playground metal, speaking secrets about boys and whatever moving pictures light up their phones these days.\n\nStrip mall stands sentinel. Sushi joint never full but keeping on somehow. Swimming store. Nail place. All of it lined up neat like artifacts in some museum of modern living. Frozen yogurt spot drawing them young ones like moths, their cups sweating in the heat while they show off on wheels and breathe sweet smoke into the heavy air, thinking themselves immortal.\n\nThis here's a piece of the old south. Time moves different here. Like molasses in winter. Everything preserved in amber, waiting. Just waiting.",
            "The houses stood like ancient sentinels. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still in their weathered communion. Small yards stretched before them and narrow drives lay alongside like pale wounds in the earth. They spoke of times past when suburban living was the dream that held this country in its grip but that dream was loosening now like a rope worn thin by time and weather. Yet these neighborhoods persisted. Called out their testament to any who'd listen that the dream hadnt died entirely.\n\nThe people walked different now. Less hope in their step. Yards gone wild where once they'd been kept pristine but still the cars sat in drives two by two like creatures waiting for the flood. Children played in the streets as if the world ended at its borders. The school stood ninety years strong conjuring futures in the young while stirring ghosts in the old. Churches sparse and empty but the basketball courts filled with life and motion. Houses different as thumbprints but kindred somehow in their bones.\n\nSuper A they called it. Run by Yemenis, perhaps the only Arab folk for miles in this sea of black faces. Streets wide as rivers where children played their games, scattering like starlings when cars approached. Folk here could trace their blood back generations in this place. Tell tales of when neighbor knew neighbor like kin.\n\nWhere once stood a karate school now stood a pharmacy. Dreams of martial glory faded with the moving pictures that spawned them. Pills took their place. The old theatre still showed its ancient reels, saved from crowds by young folk's scorn but blessed by the elders who found comfort in its dimness, away from children's eyes.\n\nA single highway passed through but never touched ground here. Young ones wanted an exit built but the elders knew better. Knew that progress was just another word for death. They were building a new school now. Talking of mascots. Some spoke of a mechanical man with a country drawl and a cabin of logs. But in this place nothing was ever truly new. Just old things wearing different faces.",
            "The city sprawls vast and merciless before him. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a gray sky that holds neither promise nor redemption. Streets wind through the maze of steel and glass, some bearing names in foreign tongues - Koreatown, Little Armenia - each a world sealed within itself. Traffic moves like blood through clogged arteries, two hours to traverse ten miles, the vehicles packed together in mindless congregation.\n\nHe studies the neighborhood from his window. Orthodox Jews in black coats moving like shadows through the morning light. Soviet refugees carrying their histories like wounds that won't heal. Rainbow flags hanging limp in windows, testaments to loves that dare speak their names. All of them moving through the same dead space, breathing the same tired air.\n\nThe parks stand like green islands in the concrete sea. Children play there still, their voices carrying across time itself, reminiscent of days when he too ran wild with the neighbor boy, before the world grew cold and strange. Now neighbors pass like ghosts, nameless, faceless, sealed behind walls and doors that never open.\n\nConstruction cranes loom against the horizon like ancient siege machines. New towers rising, steel bones reaching skyward, while below the streets grow more congested, more choked with each passing season. Parking spaces become rare as gold. The city devours itself and grows hungry still.\n\nHouses crouch between the towers - single homes, duplexes, small apartment blocks - each one a universe unto itself. Some dating back to times when people still knew their neighbors' names, when communities weren't just words in real estate listings. But those days are gone now, gone like smoke in the wind, like all things must go.\n\nThe streets fill and empty, fill and empty, an endless tide of humanity washing through the concrete canyons. Each soul carrying its own story, its own burden, moving through the vastness alone. The city holds them all, indifferent as God, while the sun wheels overhead in a sky the color of beaten lead.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn. This is it, I told her. She'd never known such emptiness, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The corn stretched out beyond sight, row upon row like soldiers in formation, waiting. I told her bout growing up here in Ohio country, watching recognition dawn in her eyes like the slow light of morning.\n\nPast the water-filled quarry the houses rose up from the earth, brick and stucco set back from the road on half-acre plots tended like holy ground. Spring brought forth flowers planted by hands that knew the seasons, knew the trees that died and lived again with each turn of the year. Mercedes machines gleamed in driveways like chrome beasts drinking the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived three houses down, always outside, always singing above his mower's drone. Doctor once, they said. Now just a man who'd lost pieces of himself to time, melding with the grass and his green John Deere like some strange hybrid creature born of lawn and machine.\n\nOur house stood grey against grey sky. Geese claimed the side yard til the terrier drove them off. Behind lay the stream that fed the quarry, carrying bullfrog song and cattle lowing from distant pastures. Cross the wooden bridge we built with our hands and you'd find yourself in untamed country. Wild flowers and herbs grew there among trees that knew no master.\n\nThis was where childhood lived. Where we built fortresses in trees and stalked imaginary prey. Where neighborhood children appeared like spirits through the brush, companions in our wild games.\n\nWinter came hard and merciless but brought its own terrible beauty. The yard transformed from living green to dead white wilderness. Trees that once bloomed pink and purple stood naked now, their dark bones reaching toward leaden sky. Snow came in the night like judgment, covering all. My sister's angels lay scattered in drifts while snowmen stood sentinel. We warred with packed ice, building frozen ramparts to shield our arsenal of winter weapons. Here in our sealed white world we played at life while real life waited somewhere beyond the fields, beyond the corn, beyond our knowing. We were children then. We knew nothing of what waited."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This land aint got no gleaming towers nor the bright lights of commerce that other folk speak of. Just farmland stretching out like a tired blanket til it meets them tourist towns. No malls here. No Walmarts. No chain restaurants with their neon signs blazing against the night sky. Everything you need is a drive away through the empty country.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold something ancient and true. Two lakes lap at the edges of our town like giant mirrors laid flat against the earth. Lake Michigan to one side vast and cold, Lake Charlevoix to the other. Everywhere you turn theres sand waiting for bare feet, water waiting to swallow your reflection.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old soldiers who've seen too much. Aint no matching faces here. Each one tells its own story. Some got fresh paint and new windows, others wear their age like medals. Most got basements you can see from the road, dug deep into the Michigan clay. Aluminum siding gone gray with time covers most, colors faded like old photographs left in the sun.\n\nChildren run wild in the streets like scattered birds. Dogs tug at their leashes. Bikes leave thin trails in the dust. Folk here know each other. Know who belongs and who dont. They wave from their grills, smoke rising up like prayers. They nod as they pass, dogs padding alongside.\n\nThe yards stay trim, grass cut low like a military haircut. No dead leaves allowed to gather and rot. Plants stand in neat rows like prisoners. Its not beautiful in the way that makes people stop and stare, but beautiful in the way that makes them want to stay. Safe. Quiet. Like the world before it went wrong.\n\nThe jail squats at the edge of town, gray and watchful. The health department beside it like some kind of promise. Planes drone overhead from the small airport, their shadows crossing yards where baseball games echo from nearby fields. The recycling center hums its own quiet song of preservation.\n\nIce cream can be had by foot, and downtown aint far if youre of a mind to walk it. Children pedal their bikes to the park like pilgrims to a shrine, eight blocks through the heart of what we call home. This here's a place where the world still makes sense. Where people can still find their way back to what matters. A place where the day ends soft and quiet, like a prayer whispered in the dark.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in the dead heat of morning. Row upon row of them identical and stark against the pallid sky. No variation in their countenance save what the homeowners association would permit in their godlike governance of such things. Small patches of grass lay before each dwelling trimmed and manicured like cemetery plots. Gravel beds with their decorative stones bleached white in the sun. The driveways short and perfect leading to garages that could shelter two vehicles and nothing more.\n\nThey'd paved these roads not long past. Fresh concrete unmarred by time or neglect stretched out before you like a river of bone. No potholes here. No imperfection that might speak to the passage of years or the weight of vehicles gone before. Some dwellings rose two stories tall but most crouched low against the earth as if wary of drawing attention to themselves.\n\nThe mailboxes stood gathered at the street's end like prisoners awaiting judgment. Not separate markers for each home as you might expect but a congregation of metal boxes bound together, each secured by its own key. Two larger chambers for parcels that might come. The association had ordained it thus and so it remained.\n\nAt the city's edge where suburban order gave way to rural chaos the neighborhood sprawled vast and purposeful. Swimming pools lay behind iron gates available to any who lived here and could prove their belonging. Walking paths wound through the emptiness like the tracks of ancient creatures long extinct. You could walk your dog there or take evening constitutional without need of designated parkland. The retired folk who made up most of the population would watch from their windows, guardians of this manufactured peace. Young professionals moved among them like ghosts, outnumbered but tolerated.\n\nThe city itself lay fifteen minutes distant by automobile, a sprawling thing that somehow maintained its small-town pretense. One mall stood there, neither grand nor humble but sufficient to its purpose. Markets of various persuasion lined the streets from the organic temples of the wealthy to the bare-bones outlets where the poor sought sustenance.\n\nThis was a place of safety and order. A place where man had imposed his will upon the landscape and called it good. The swimming pools gleamed like blind eyes in the sun. The walking trails wound their way through carefully managed wilderness. And all of it lay just far enough from commerce to maintain its isolation while remaining within reach of every chain store and market that modern life demanded. This was civilization's compromise with chaos, and it endured.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the vanished. Strange thing to hear in a city where folk paid thousands just to lay their heads. None I knew spoke of such tales. Maybe it's the weight of living crushing down. Some nights you hear the sobbing through the walls, through the floors. Folk learn to scrape by. Learn to love the smell of other people's castoffs, mothballed clothes and broken toys laid out on folding tables in the dust. The smell of youth dies quiet. Some take to smoking. Some just forget what clean air tastes like. But the flea market smell, it stays. Settles in like death. Smells like forgotten magazines yellowing on a dead piano. Gets in the leather and wont wash out no matter what you do.\n\nThree secondhand stores within walking. Start at the far end, you can work your way through two charity shops, the library with its musty books, rare book dealer, curio shop with its shelves of dead men's treasures. Downtown's thick with bodies and machines, morning till night, but step inside them stores and the world goes quiet as a tomb. Good place to lose yourself. More of them coming every year, the bodies and machines. Growing city, they say. Some big company dealing in clicks and packages made its home here. Like New York in a way. Everyone got their own heading, don't nobody ask much of you. Can keep to yourself, quiet-like, independent. Not like down South where caring means prying. Here you can keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like waves on a dead shore.\n\nLife still moves though. Got a piano player next door, couple singers upstairs always working their scales. Less strangers sharing walls than a kind of family. Come together when needs must. Share the birthdays, the funerals, the hard times. Lucky in a way. Most of them treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I can. Trade favors like mail delivery. See them smile when I pass and think maybe they're glad of me like I'm glad of them. Living in this great concrete maze of modern times but it's them makes me think I ain't totally lost my way after all.",
            "The town lies just beyond where the city's reach ends. A small place. Midwestern. We live on the east side where the poorest folk dwell in homes worth little more than kindling. Rental signs stand like sentries on grassless yards. But there aint no ugliness here like you might expect. Folk still nod and speak when you pass. They remember such things.\n\nViolence visits sometimes like an unwelcome relative that wont leave. Gunshots in the night. Blood on sidewalks. The neighbors boy got killed outside some bar last year. His mother still sits on that porch watching nothing. We lost a few things left outside but nothing more. The real killer here is that white powder. Fentanyl. It takes them quick and quiet. Town's got places for them that want help. Teaching folks how to bring the dead back with that Narcan. Some make it. Most dont.\n\nThe boy goes to school where they treat him right despite his differences. Good people there. Teachers that still care about such things. Parents meeting regular to plan things for the children. More than twenty of every hundred here cant feed their own so the school feeds em all. Breakfast and lunch. No child marked for being poor.\n\nThe council men build their gardens and fix their roads but mostly in the middle of town or the west side where the money lives. East side gets forgotten like an old dog under the porch. But we been here sixteen years in this little house that aint worth much but keeps the rain out. Stores enough to get by. Good people mostly. Cant imagine being nowhere else though sometimes at night I hear them shots and wonder if the devil aint living here too somewhere in them shadows.",
            "The neighborhood rises like some ancient beast from the belly of the city, its spine a ridge of weathered buildings crowned with histories dark and deep. Seven stories up I dwell, across from where the theater stands sentinel, its marquee dead and silent now like the eyes of something long buried. Down the slope there's a place where folk gather when the nights turn warm, an arcade bar they call it, though it bears little resemblance to the penny arcades of old. They queue there in the summer months, June and July mostly, standing patient and solemn like mourners at some perpetual wake.\n\nThe park lies northward, vast and empty save for the concrete that rings it like a collar, steps carved into its throat like the marks of some ancient ceremony. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents arrayed in rows precise as headstones. Rain comes more often than snow, beating against canvas like nature's own dirge. They huddle close, these wanderers, seeking warmth in numbers, closer to the heart of things than out there in what they call the jungle. The family center stands like a beacon, offering water and soap and brief moments of dignity.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks to me, nor them proud old buildings that march down toward the sea. It's the people carrying their histories like scripture. Hilltop, they say, was once mean as a rattler, gang violence flowing through its streets like poison. Federal men came through with their badges and guns, sweeping clean what couldn't be cleaned. The stories persist, passed down like dark gospels, mother to child, stranger to stranger.\n\nThe people here, they tend their streets like gardens, though outsiders still speak of danger. White folk, they say, best clear out after dark. But that's just echoes, old fears speaking with dead tongues. Maybe it's the darkness in my own blood that lets me pass, or maybe Hilltop knows its own - them that understand how fear and ignorance breed like rats in the walls of this supposed melting pot paradise.\n\nThis is home now. These streets know me like I know them. Strangers offer warmth more often than harm. The laundry woman keeps her lights burning when the rain comes horizontal and mean. I've sat against cold concrete, thinking myself invisible as ash, only to have some passerby reach down with a five-dollar bill and words sweet as scripture: you're beautiful, they say, you're valuable. And in this place, in this moment, it rings true as gospel.",
            "They came to this place when he was thirteen summers old, before the boy had learned the ways of men. The houses stood like sentinels, two stories tall and identical in their suburban uniformity, stretched out along the asphalt road that wound through the development like a black river. The boy had no friends then but time brought him two companions, one who lived two doors down and another who dwelt further along the street. Both gone now but their ghosts remained.\n\nThe neighborhood stood unchanged. Like some photograph yellowed with age but preserved in its essence. Children's voices carried on the warm wind whenever the sun showed itself, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. Most days the streets lay quiet. No quarrels with neighbors. No strife. A place where solitude was respected save when aid was needed. Packages left on porches remained untouched, as if protected by some unspoken covenant between the dwellers of this place.\n\nThere was a park. Not more than a hundred yards distant. A place of memories both blessed and cursed. Where basketballs had arced through summer evenings and footballs spiraled against gray autumn skies. Where blood had flowed from the boy's nose one cold afternoon, crimson drops staining white winter ground. Now he brought his cousin's children there, watching them swing and slide in their innocent joy, their excitement pure and untainted by time's passing.\n\nThe streets around teemed with the foods of many nations. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All within walking distance though most now summoned their sustenance through glowing screens and waiting drivers. Fast food joints squatted on corners like gargoyles, identical to those in every other suburb in this vast land. Pizza parlors too, their red signs glowing in the dusk.\n\nStores lined the streets like trading posts of old. Dry cleaners. Drug stores facing each other across the road like duelists. A grocery store bearing a name known only to those who dwelled in these northern territories. And there was the Indian store, its shelves stocked with spices and strange grains, preserved foods in jars like specimens in some exotic museum.\n\nHe thought of other neighborhoods he'd read about. Places where darkness dwelt in men's hearts and evil walked abroad in daylight. This place was not like those. Here was peace of a sort. Here was home.",
            "The college stands near where I live, a blessing of sorts in this godless stretch of urban decay. Apartment buildings rise like ancient monoliths against a gray sky, their facades weathered and worn by time's merciless march. Between them stand the bars and eateries where the young gather, counting their meager coins for watered-down spirits. One such establishment recently took on a new name, as if christening could wash away its sins of overpriced libations and indifferent service.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes: the students, temporary as morning frost, and the poor souls anchored by poverty to these crumbling walls. Children too, their voices carrying across concrete and asphalt from the schoolyard nearby. My neighbors remain strangers by choice, though their marijuana smoke seeps through walls like some spectral presence. Management's solution: a plastic box spewing artificial freshness, a joke told in the language of corporate impotence.\n\nDown the road stand new buildings, false promises wrapped in cheap materials and high rent. Their walls thin as playing cards, built by men who knew nothing of permanence. A restaurant serves microwaved sustenance on paper plates, a temple to disposable living. Beside it squats a gas station, where desperate men trade hours of their lives for dollars.\n\nThe city, in its infinite wisdom, laid new concrete paths and planted grass in strips, as if nature could be parceled and contained. My building hunkers beneath ancient trees, some now reduced to stumps like broken teeth in a dying mouth. Behind us lies 43rd Street, a darker reflection of our own, where cracked sidewalks spider-web beneath feet and buildings wear their shame openly. Crime blooms there like black mold, though it seeps across boundaries, respecting no borders we devise.\n\nYet I remain, tethered by economics and convenience to this place. The university stands within walking distance, and buses carry the carless to their destinations like modern-day ferrymen. This is my station now, among the concrete and the dying trees, in this purgatory between poverty and promise.",
            "The duplexes stood like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, their white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass. They'd built them to look separate but they wasnt. Folk gathered most evenings at the end of whatever drive suited them, speaking soft words while their young ones made chalk marks on the concrete or sent their kites up into that vast blue nothing. Like some forgotten time it was. A place where the mechanical world hadnt yet laid its cold hand.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up black against the sky where clouds moved like great white ships. But the weather it had turned. Last night the sirens came wailing through the darkness and we knew what was coming. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever treasures I thought to save while the big one paced the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own marbles hitting the earth. When it was done the road steamed like some creature breathing its last and the temperature had dropped from ninety-two to seventy-five quick as a thought. The hail melted where it struck the burning pavement and then the sun broke through and the rain came again and with it two rainbows arced across the sky like some biblical covenant.\n\nThe houses stood quiet for a time after, till folk began to drift back from wherever they'd sheltered. Then it was like always. Women watching their young ones while dinner cooked inside. Different from New Hampshire this place was, forty minutes outside Charlotte where I'd come to rest. The southern voices soft and strange like music from another country. Two bedrooms and two baths in each unit though some were smaller inside than others which didnt make no sense but that's how it was.\n\nBehind the houses there was a pond where swimming wasnt allowed and I'd walk there sometimes seeing deer moving like ghosts through the morning mist while bullfrogs sang their ancient songs. Roosters called from the surrounding farms each dawn and sometimes in the evening a donkey would bray into the growing dark like he was telling the world he still drew breath. A good place it was. A place a body could call home.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Memory holds the move from Riverdale to Stockbridge like a photograph faded at the edges. Tears came then, for what was lost and what was loved, though mama and daddy had their reasons. Better schools they said. Better houses. Places where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nTime passed like water through fingers. Made friends and enemies both, though neighbors remained strangers save for Mr. Glen and Dennis living adjacent. Good folk. Like blood almost. Remember Mr. Glen's wedding clear as yesterday, him taking another wife. Caught the white garter when Ms. Veda sent it sailing through the lamplight. Danced with Marsharii that night, her face young and full of promise. Never saw her after. World swallows some whole.\n\nThe streets here wind like snakes in summer grass. GPS helps now but before it was just wandering. Me and Kason and Curtis, we'd lose ourselves in video games, in the simple pleasure of being young and alive. Sometimes I'd walk alone to the park where the trees stand sentinel. Brought sticks from the hardware store to practice balance, brought the wooden sword too. Something holy in that solitude.\n\nCourts there for basketball and tennis both, empty now but waiting. Daddy and Mr. Graves taught us tennis years back, worked us till our muscles burned and our hearts sang. Good times those were. Simple times.\n\nReckon there's more stories buried in these streets than I could tell in a day. But these are the ones that stick like burrs to the soul, that won't shake loose no matter how far you walk. And somewhere ahead the future waits, patient as stone, holding whatever comes next in its dark hands.",
            "Johnston lay there in the South Carolina heat like some forgotten outpost of civilization. A town that breathed peaches. The welcome sign proclaimed it proud, Peach Capital of the World, though the world had long since moved on from such declarations. Fields stretched out beyond sight, peach trees standing sentinel over the cattle that grazed in the spaces between. Houses set back from the road like afterthoughts, metal roofs gleaming under the merciless sun or gray shingles dulled by time and weather, each dwelling an island in the agricultural sea.\n\nThe town center nothing more than a single stoplight swaying in the wind at a fourway crossing, watching over the few establishments that clung to existence there. Hong Kong, run by a family whose story was never told. Fiesta Mexican. Gary's with its burgers. The pizzeria long gone now, its windows dark and empty like dead eyes. Maxwell and Halford Drug still poured cherry cola like some remnant of an older time. IGA stood charging prices that drove folk twenty miles to Batesburg-Leesville where the Walmart waited like some retail paradise.\n\nDollar General remained the heart of it all, its fluorescent pulse drawing people from sunup to sundown. Possibilities Furniture & More occupied its corner, the owner's kindness a currency more valuable than money, her two movers like disciples of her trade. Next door the pet groomer tended to the town's companions, washing and clipping away the dust of rural life.\n\nThe doctor and the vet practiced their arts in quiet buildings away from the center, treating the living things of Johnston with what tools they had. The elementary school stood alone, releasing its children to other towns once they grew too old for its walls. They were building a park now, two and a half acres of hope for a future that might never come.\n\nNo theaters here. No bowling alleys. No places for youth to gather and dream of escape. Just the road through town, quick enough to miss in a blink, like a dream you cant quite remember come morning. The town endured, neither dying nor truly living, suspended in the humid air like a peach not yet ready to fall.",
            "The street runs between two highways like a vein between arteries, carrying the lifeblood of traffic past our house that stands sentinel at the corner where the pavement bends. Tennessee. Small town. The kind of place where folk dont come and go much anymore, like the world done forgot about it somehow. We watch them all from here, me and the wife and the two girls, eleven and fourteen, watching through windows like pale ghosts in a house that's become our world entire.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out before us like some dying thing, houses scattered among trees that was here long before any of us. Folk go about their business like they always have. Mowing grass till the machines sound like theyre calling to one another across the yards, March through October when the grass finally yields to the coming cold. Then the leaves begin their death march, drifting down in browns and reds till they carpet the ground and we burn them, the smoke rising up like prayers in the autumn air.\n\nWinter ain't what it used to be. More like autumn that won't die, hanging on past its time. The children still find their way down the hill on sleds when the snow comes, which ain't often anymore. Most days its just bikes and dogs and walkers moving through the street like specters in some half-remembered dream.\n\nThe garage stands at the back of the house where I work on my truck, doors open to the world like wounds. Front door might as well be sealed shut for all we use it. Holidays bring the strangers, cars lined up and down the street like mourners at a wake. Thanksgiving. Christmas. Mother's Day. They come and they go and the street returns to its silence.\n\nSometimes we cook out back, smoke rising from the grill like signals to whoever might be watching. Sometimes we play in the rain, the water washing away whatever sins we might have gathered. But mostly we just watch. Watch the cars pass, watch the seasons change, watch the neighbors move through their lives like actors in some great theater we cant quite understand. This street, this life, this endless procession of days. It'd be perfect if it weren't for the traffic. But nothing's perfect anymore. Maybe it never was.",
            "The land stretches out brown and dead, nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. Dirt and more dirt still. Nobody knows what it means less they lived here, less they woke each morning to that vast brown emptiness, the rare patch of green lawn standing like some rich man's mockery of nature itself. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart, scattered like bones across the waste. Still do mostly, though new structures rise up now, civilization creeping in slow but steady like some horrid tide.\n\nPlace grows more citified with each passing season though that's the way of things everywhere now. Folk here are kindly enough but like anywhere there's good and there's bad and there's worse. My patch is ringed with old folk, friendly enough, marking this as one of the better places though that don't mean much. The stores are all them chain operations. Food For Less. Smart and Final. Nothing fancy. You want that kind of thing you got to travel and even then.\n\nConstruction work's what keeps most alive out here. Not from reading no statistics but from watching. Makes sense with all this empty space waiting to be filled. That thought sits in my gut like a stone. Left the big city to get away from all that. Now I work construction myself, hanging drywall and ceiling bars, watching the spread of it.\n\nBut it's the animals make this place what it is. Folk come here for different reasons but mainly it's the stark beauty of it, the challenge of it. Desert's got its own rules, its own way of being. Got creatures living here can't live nowhere else. Human folk best learn to live alongside em proper. My young ones took to it natural. Even now they're out there hunting lizards and desert bugs like some primitive tribesmen, learning the ways of this hard land.\n\nTown's got its attractions if you want em. County fair comes through regular. Folks head up to Wrightwood when they need to see snow, learn to slide down mountains for sport. Museum's got old bones and Indian things, tells how this place came to be what it is. But that ain't what matters. What matters is the desert itself, vast and empty, waiting patient as stone while we scurry bout building our little lives atop it, temporary as morning dew.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete labyrinth. Gray and godless. He reckons it his neighborhood though he knows such words mean little now. Not like the neighborhoods of old where families dwelt in their separate houses and children played in streets now long dead and gone.\n\nThe buildings rise up like ancient monoliths. Three kinds there are. The apartments first, stacked two stories high with their identical windows staring out blind and dark. Twenty souls perhaps in each one, though he cannot be sure. Then the houses proper, scattered few and far between, where the old guard dwells. Alumni they're called, though such words mean little now. And last the dormitories, great concrete hives where hundreds sleep two by two in cells no bigger than prison holds.\n\nThe people here are of all kinds and colors, though that matters little now. The elders keep to their houses while the young ones crowd the dorms and the ones between take the apartments. Like some great sorting of souls, each to their designated place in this concrete purgatory.\n\nThere are stores too, though they ain't like the stores of old. Places to eat and places to buy clothes marked with symbols of learning. A single park remains, kept clean by some unspoken covenant among those who dwell here. At night it lies empty and dark, the swings creaking soft in the wind like hanging men.\n\nHe studies it all through eyes grown tired of looking. This is his neighborhood now, this place of learning and waiting. Self-contained and sealed off from the world beyond like some great ark adrift on a sea of asphalt and concrete. He knows no other home now. Knows too that home is just a word, like neighborhood, like community. Words that mean less with each passing day.\n\nBut still they persist here, all of them, in their concrete caves and their borrowed beds. Still they wake each morning and go about their rituals of learning, as if such things still matter in a world grown strange and cold. Perhaps they do. Perhaps this is all that's left to them now. This place. These people. This neighborhood that ain't really a neighborhood at all.",
            "No sidewalks here. The world tilts downward from where the house stands like some ancient sentinel at the peak of what they call the workout hill, though there aint nothing about exercise in its nature. Just gravity and the weight of things. Folk walk in the road cause there aint no choice about it. The pavement's broke and scarred like an old fighter's face, pocked with holes that'll tear the heart out of any vehicle daring enough to pass. Above it all hang the wires, patched and mended like a vagrant's coat, victims of countless storms that rake through here regular as grief. The repairmen come and go and the wires get uglier.\n\nTrees rise up everywhere. Tall evergreens that folk hate cause they block the view of the water. They cut em down with a vengeance born of greed, building their glass houses higher and higher, reaching up like drowning men for a glimpse of the bay. At sunset the water burns like molten copper but mostly its hidden behind clouds thick as wool blankets, the light filtering through like some weak memory of brightness. The damp claims everything here. Moss creeps across the world like a plague, turning roofs and cars and metal to green fur. Left my own vehicle out once and nature took it back, took three hours of scraping to reclaim it from the green.\n\nAint many children. Just old folk waiting out their days, and dogs. Dogs everywhere, running wild and free, sneaking into houses like thieves through any door left open by the careless. Found one in my living room once, staring at me like I was the intruder. The rabbits too, big as cats some of them, tearing up gardens till my cats hunted em down. Birds pass through - sparrows, hummingbirds small as thoughts, and sometimes a hawk floating overhead till the crows drive it off like some dark army protecting their territory.\n\nDown by the water there's places to eat what the bay provides, though there aint much beach to speak of. Just rocks for throwing into the gray water. The opposite shore sits out there in the mist like some dream of civilization, close enough to see but too far to touch. Just watching and waiting while the fog rolls in.",
            "They say Bensonhurst aint hard to find. The trains come and go like metal serpents through the concrete canyons of Brooklyn, carrying souls worn thin by the city's weight. The streets lay dark and solemn beneath perpetual sheets of gray sky.\n\nThe neighborhood bears its own particular darkness. Not the darkness of empty places but the darkness of too many souls pressed together in weathered buildings that stand like tired sentinels. Asian letters flash their neon promises from every storefront, marking territory claimed over decades past. Supermarkets and laundromats line the streets like prayer beads on a rosary, each one identical to the last, each one necessary as breath.\n\nWhere I stand now there are four markets within sight of each other, their windows fogged with steam and voices speaking in tongues I do not know. The people here are pilgrims all, first and second sons of immigrants seeking something they cannot name. The businesses belong mostly to the Asians now, their industry as relentless as the tide.\n\nThey built a park nearby. Ten courts for basketball where children play their endless games. Soccer fields stretch out like dead grass seas. Handball courts stand silent as tombs until filled with the echo of rubber balls and young voices. A fountain spits water in summer months, blessing the children with temporary baptism.\n\nThe buildings here are low and humble. No glass towers reach for God. Just homes stacked two deep where families weather the long nights. Music bleeds from passing cars like wounds, engines roar their defiance at the dawn. Nights bring their own particular terrors. The streets grow teeth. Men with hollow eyes seek prey among the shadows.\n\nI knew their violence once. Felt fists against flesh, learned the taste of blood and fear. Now thieves hunt packages left on stoops like carrion birds. And everywhere the dogs leave their offerings, ignored by masters who have forgotten the meaning of civilization. The city fines mean nothing here where law is just a whisper carried away by wind.\n\nWatch your step in Bensonhurst. The concrete remembers everything it has seen.",
            "You got to know what weird means in Portland Oregon fore you can understand the place itself. Written up on some building that serves pizza and liquor and flesh and music and probably breaks half dozen laws doing it are the words Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say its bout remembering the old days when the city wasnt so known and wasnt so dear and folk could make something different of themselves here. Others hear it like a calling. Come to Portland theyd say. We'll call you weird here too but we'll mean it kind.\n\nThe Californians came with their money and their condos rose like concrete weeds from the earth but Portland stayed weird all the same. Not that weird means kind exactly. More like accepting things others wont accept. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere else in this godforsaken country. Weird aint about that.\n\nIn my part of town the houses stand painted in colors that'd make a carnival jealous. Gardens growing wild with herbs and flowers pressing up through cracks in the sidewalk like nature trying to take back whats hers. And there's them free boxes. Just cardboard mostly though sometimes plastic. Like offerings to whatever gods still care to look down on us. Books and clothes mostly but could be anything. Something bout walking these streets in Southeast makes you believe in magic again. Least thats how I see it but Im just one kind of weird in this city of thousands.\n\nSome folk wouldnt touch nothing from a sidewalk box. They do their yoga with goats. Yes real goats. Or they go watch them Timbers kick a ball round a field. Portland's got all kinds. Dreamers and drunks and them that cant tell the difference no more.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray and constant like God crying. Brings the darkness in peoples minds. We got drugs here sure. Got homeless too. More than most places cause we try to help em but we dont help enough. Never enough. The rest of us we care bout em or we hate em depending on the day. In that we aint weird at all. Just human. Poor sorry humans same as anywhere else.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel. Always there in the north, bearing witness to the coming and going of light like some ancient gods carved from stone. A man might forget them in the daily toil of existence but they remain, unmoved and unchanging, like thoughts in the mind of God. When the weight of living becomes too much they call out with their silence and a man might look upon them and find some measure of peace in their permanence.\n\nI came here first as a young man. The university stretched out below them peaks like some congregation before an altar. Fine buildings there were and pools of water reflecting the sky and trees that had stood longer than any man's memory but it was them mountains that held dominion over all. The town beneath grew like weeds in the shadow of stone. Coffee houses with their bitter smell where young folk bent over books in the small hours. The downtown with its old brick worn smooth by time and weather, buildings pressed together like folk huddled against the cold. For them few blocks it was like some greater city had sprouted up out of the quiet earth but that feeling passed quick as it came once you walked past the library.\n\nMemories collect in such places like water in a basin. Some sweet and some bitter. Walking with friends past playground swings gone to rust in the darkness after studying all night. Running through crowded streets to catch some picture show in that fancy theater. But there were darker times too. Sitting by them ponds at two in the morning watching ducks and turtles going about their business while inside your head the darkness grows. Watching them creatures each with their purpose while your own seems lost in the vastness of living.\n\nSo I walked. Past the pond and the park and them little houses all lined up neat like graves. When I reached the main road the sun was coming up, painting everything in fire and shadow. Palm trees stood like sentries and above it all them mountains remained. Cutting into that fire-touched sky like they had done since before man walked upright. And something in that permanence spoke without speaking. Some truth older than words about carrying on. About enduring.",
            "You wouldnt see it at first passing. Just retail facades and empty lots where folk once shopped for organic produce and whatnot. But beyond the dead Whole Foods and past them hotels that only breathe life when summer brings the reunions of blood kin, there's a whole world moving and breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like great concrete monoliths laid out in perfect succession, each one watching the other in some kind of architectural vigil. First ones got darkness in their history. Best leave them be. Truth aint always what papers tell.\n\nBeyond these stands another world. Silent. Unknown to most. College buildings squatting low against the earth, students dragging themselves through iron gates that screech like dying things in the dawn light. Traffic backed up while morning folk curse from their vehicles, their words lost in the heavy air.\n\nRoad ends at a T, park on one side and them bone-mending folks on the other. Their porch with its wicker chairs and that ceiling fan turning slow circles in air thick as molasses. Children spinning themselves through the grass like gyroscopes while bees work the flowers growing wild by the roadside. Old ones walking their dogs, eyeing the young ones on their boards with suspicion born of years. Girls gather like birds on playground metal, speaking secrets about boys and whatever moving pictures light up their phones these days.\n\nStrip mall stands sentinel. Sushi joint never full but keeping on somehow. Swimming store. Nail place. All of it lined up neat like artifacts in some museum of modern living. Frozen yogurt spot drawing them young ones like moths, their cups sweating in the heat while they show off on wheels and breathe sweet smoke into the heavy air, thinking themselves immortal.\n\nThis here's a piece of the old south. Time moves different here. Like molasses in winter. Everything preserved in amber, waiting. Just waiting.",
            "The houses stood like ancient sentinels. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still in their weathered communion. Small yards stretched before them and narrow drives lay alongside like pale wounds in the earth. They spoke of times past when suburban living was the dream that held this country in its grip but that dream was loosening now like a rope worn thin by time and weather. Yet these neighborhoods persisted. Called out their testament to any who'd listen that the dream hadnt died entirely.\n\nThe people walked different now. Less hope in their step. Yards gone wild where once they'd been kept pristine but still the cars sat in drives two by two like creatures waiting for the flood. Children played in the streets as if the world ended at its borders. The school stood ninety years strong conjuring futures in the young while stirring ghosts in the old. Churches sparse and empty but the basketball courts filled with life and motion. Houses different as thumbprints but kindred somehow in their bones.\n\nSuper A they called it. Run by Yemenis, perhaps the only Arab folk for miles in this sea of black faces. Streets wide as rivers where children played their games, scattering like starlings when cars approached. Folk here could trace their blood back generations in this place. Tell tales of when neighbor knew neighbor like kin.\n\nWhere once stood a karate school now stood a pharmacy. Dreams of martial glory faded with the moving pictures that spawned them. Pills took their place. The old theatre still showed its ancient reels, saved from crowds by young folk's scorn but blessed by the elders who found comfort in its dimness, away from children's eyes.\n\nA single highway passed through but never touched ground here. Young ones wanted an exit built but the elders knew better. Knew that progress was just another word for death. They were building a new school now. Talking of mascots. Some spoke of a mechanical man with a country drawl and a cabin of logs. But in this place nothing was ever truly new. Just old things wearing different faces.",
            "The city sprawls vast and merciless before him. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a gray sky that holds neither promise nor redemption. Streets wind through the maze of steel and glass, some bearing names in foreign tongues - Koreatown, Little Armenia - each a world sealed within itself. Traffic moves like blood through clogged arteries, two hours to traverse ten miles, the vehicles packed together in mindless congregation.\n\nHe studies the neighborhood from his window. Orthodox Jews in black coats moving like shadows through the morning light. Soviet refugees carrying their histories like wounds that won't heal. Rainbow flags hanging limp in windows, testaments to loves that dare speak their names. All of them moving through the same dead space, breathing the same tired air.\n\nThe parks stand like green islands in the concrete sea. Children play there still, their voices carrying across time itself, reminiscent of days when he too ran wild with the neighbor boy, before the world grew cold and strange. Now neighbors pass like ghosts, nameless, faceless, sealed behind walls and doors that never open.\n\nConstruction cranes loom against the horizon like ancient siege machines. New towers rising, steel bones reaching skyward, while below the streets grow more congested, more choked with each passing season. Parking spaces become rare as gold. The city devours itself and grows hungry still.\n\nHouses crouch between the towers - single homes, duplexes, small apartment blocks - each one a universe unto itself. Some dating back to times when people still knew their neighbors' names, when communities weren't just words in real estate listings. But those days are gone now, gone like smoke in the wind, like all things must go.\n\nThe streets fill and empty, fill and empty, an endless tide of humanity washing through the concrete canyons. Each soul carrying its own story, its own burden, moving through the vastness alone. The city holds them all, indifferent as God, while the sun wheels overhead in a sky the color of beaten lead.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn. This is it, I told her. She'd never known such emptiness, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The corn stretched out beyond sight, row upon row like soldiers in formation, waiting. I told her bout growing up here in Ohio country, watching recognition dawn in her eyes like the slow light of morning.\n\nPast the water-filled quarry the houses rose up from the earth, brick and stucco set back from the road on half-acre plots tended like holy ground. Spring brought forth flowers planted by hands that knew the seasons, knew the trees that died and lived again with each turn of the year. Mercedes machines gleamed in driveways like chrome beasts drinking the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived three houses down, always outside, always singing above his mower's drone. Doctor once, they said. Now just a man who'd lost pieces of himself to time, melding with the grass and his green John Deere like some strange hybrid creature born of lawn and machine.\n\nOur house stood grey against grey sky. Geese claimed the side yard til the terrier drove them off. Behind lay the stream that fed the quarry, carrying bullfrog song and cattle lowing from distant pastures. Cross the wooden bridge we built with our hands and you'd find yourself in untamed country. Wild flowers and herbs grew there among trees that knew no master.\n\nThis was where childhood lived. Where we built fortresses in trees and stalked imaginary prey. Where neighborhood children appeared like spirits through the brush, companions in our wild games.\n\nWinter came hard and merciless but brought its own terrible beauty. The yard transformed from living green to dead white wilderness. Trees that once bloomed pink and purple stood naked now, their dark bones reaching toward leaden sky. Snow came in the night like judgment, covering all. My sister's angels lay scattered in drifts while snowmen stood sentinel. We warred with packed ice, building frozen ramparts to shield our arsenal of winter weapons. Here in our sealed white world we played at life while real life waited somewhere beyond the fields, beyond the corn, beyond our knowing. We were children then. We knew nothing of what waited."
