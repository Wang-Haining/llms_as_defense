            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "They call this place Rural America though that aint what it is. Not really. Small town Michigan where the farmland bleeds into tourist towns like blood seeping into cotton. No malls here. No Walmart. No chain restaurants with their neon signs bleeding into the night. Just miles of road stretching between anywhere you need to be.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold something ancient and true. Lake Michigan vast and gray to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, like twin mirrors reflecting whatever truth God left behind. Beaches everywhere you turn, sand and stone waiting for footprints that the water will wash away come morning.\n\nThe neighborhood aint like them suburbs where houses stand shoulder to shoulder like prisoners. These homes got history in their bones. Some fixed up nice, others wearing their age like medals. Most got basements you can see from the street, concrete testimonials to what lies beneath. Aluminum siding gone gray or blue or whatever color folks chose when hope still meant something.\n\nYards spread out like promises. Trampolines standing dark against the sky, swing sets creaking in the wind. Gardens where people still believe things can grow. Fences holding dogs that bark at shadows. These houses speak of work and family and the kind of tired that comes honest.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things, their voices carrying on the wind. Dog walkers and bikers move like ghosts through the evening light. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. Someone's always cooking outside, smoke rising up like prayers. Someone's always waving, smiling, pretending the world aint what it is.\n\nThe lawns stay trim, leaves dont gather. Everything maintained like keeping order might keep chaos at bay. It aint beautiful the way money makes things beautiful, but it's got truth in it. Safety. The kind of place where you can sleep without one eye open.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, and the health department. The recycling center where people bring what's left of things. Baseball fields echo with voices calling names into the darkness. The airport sends its metal birds into the sky, their engines growling like distant thunder. Ice cream shop still standing like it has since before any of us were born. Downtown just a walk away, though walking aint what folks do much anymore.\n\nThe children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through what's left of America. And maybe that's what makes it good. Maybe that's what makes it true. This place. This small piece of what we pretend the world still is.",
            "The houses stood like grave markers in that suburban waste. All of them the same. All of them built to some godless specification laid down by men who'd never set foot on the land. The homeowner's association saw to that. There was grass cut low and stone scattered about and driveways so short a man could cross them in three steps. Small trees dotted the landscape like sentries. Two-car garages lined the streets like empty eye sockets staring into nothing.\n\nThe roads were smooth. Too smooth. No potholes nor cracks marred their perfect surface. As if the earth beneath refused to claim them. Single story dwellings mostly though some rose higher, reaching toward a sky that cared nothing for their aspirations. No mailboxes stood before these houses. Instead they gathered in clusters at the street's end, metal boxes requiring keys, like jail cells for paper and parcels.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the city's edge where civilization met wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land stretched out beyond sight. Swimming pools imprisoned behind iron gates. Walking trails snaked through the emptiness like the tracks of some ancient serpent. You could walk them till your feet bled and never see the same ground twice. \n\nThe old ones lived there mostly. Retirees who'd come to die in peace. Some younger folk too, with their pressed shirts and clean cars. All of them pretending at community, at safety. They watched each other's houses and spoke of brotherhood but they knew nothing of true watching, true brotherhood.\n\nThe city beyond was vast but played at being small. One mall stood like a monument to commerce. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to stores that sold food both costly and cheap. Organic produce displayed like jewels in one place, bare shelves and skeleton crews in another. All of it meaningless. All of it temporary.\n\nThe neighborhood endured. Clean. Safe. Empty of soul. The pools reflected nothing. The trails led nowhere. And the houses stood watching, waiting for something that would never come.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the lost ones, crackling through wire and static like spirits caught between worlds. Strange thing it was. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each turning of the moon and none who lived there knew anything of such tales. Maybe it was the weight of living pressing down. Known folk who'd weep in the nighttime hours when sleep wouldn't come. Everything dear now but we learned to scrape by, year on year.\n\nYou come to know the smell of secondhand things. Smell of dust and age on toys and clothes pulled from darkness. Childhood has its scents but they fade. Some take to tobacco, others just forget what was. But the markets of the poor remain. Adulthood smells of yellowed paper stacked on dead pianos, leather that holds memories even after the washing. Three stores of cast-off things within walking. Starting far out you can trace a path through charity shops, past the library where old books sleep, through curio shops where time stands still.\n\nDowntown's thick with metal and flesh, morning till night, but in those shops silence rules deep as death. Good place to lose yourself when the hours grow long. Each year brings more. Cars and bodies flood the streets like rivers of chrome and bone. Growing city, they say. Some great empire of the digital age making its home here, spreading like a cancer. Makes me think of New York. Everyone chasing their own ghosts, asking nothing of nobody. You can wrap yourself in solitude and none will try to breach it. Not like down South where concern masquerades as kindness. Here you keep your walls high as you please and the city breaks against them like dark water on stone.\n\nLife moves all around. Piano man next door, singers above, their sounds carrying through walls thin as paper. Less strangers now than something like kin. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Found something like fortune here. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean my trace, share what food comes my way, carry their letters like messages between camps. Good to see them, good to be seen. Living in this concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make me think I ain't damned my soul entirely.",
            "The town lay just beyond the reach of the city's sprawl, a small midwestern place where the east side bore the mark of poverty like an old wound. Houses stood weather-beaten and dim, most occupied by those who had little, yet they endured. Not an ugly place. No. The people there would nod and speak when you passed, their faces carrying something of the old world's courtesy despite what time and circumstance had written upon them.\n\nViolence visited sometimes, though not often. In the past years there had been shootings, a killing or two within walking distance. The neighbors boy, shot dead outside a bar not a year past. They heard the shots perhaps, or maybe just the sirens after. Things disappeared from porches in the night. Small things. Left out like offerings to whatever gods still walked these streets.\n\nThe opioid scourge had touched this place same as everywhere. Fentanyl claiming souls like some dark harvester moving through the corn. They had places for the addicted though. Centers where they tried to pull them back from that precipice. People learning to push life back into the dead with Narcan, like some grim resurrection.\n\nThe boy's school stood as a sanctuary. Good people there. Teachers who understood. No child went hungry, all fed same as the next without regard to what their people could pay. The boy, different from the others but loved all the same, found peace there among the chaos of childhood.\n\nThe town council had tried to paint beauty over decay. New roads laid down, parks restored, gardens planted. But their attention turned always to the west side where the money flowed, where commerce still breathed. The east side waited, patient as stone, for care that never came.\n\nSixteen years in this place. The house wasn't much but it held warmth and memories like a vessel. Home was what it was. What it had always been. They couldn't imagine another. Sometimes at night he'd stand on the porch looking out over the neighborhood, watching porch lights wink out one by one, thinking how this place had become the story of their lives, for better or worse, until whatever end waited for them all.",
            "The neighborhood sets upon the hill like some ancient monument to time forgotten. Seven stories up I dwell across from where the theater stands weathered and proud, its marquee dead these many years. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather round arcade machines while neon burns holes in the night. Summer brings them like pilgrims, standing patient in lines that snake down sidewalks worn smooth by countless feet before.\n\nThe park lies north. Concrete walls rise up round it, steps carved like teeth in the gray face of stone. Winter brings the wanderers, their tents clustered close as dying animals seeking warmth against the rain that falls without cease. Not snow here but water eternal, drumming on canvas, seeping into bones. They gather near the shelter where steam rises from showers like spirits fleeing flesh.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks truth here. Not the proud buildings nor the hills that roll like waves toward the distant sea. It's the people carrying memories like scars. Tales of when Hilltop ran red with gang wars, when federal men swept through like dark angels bearing badges and guns. These stories pass like scripture from fathers to sons, mothers to daughters, old residents to new blood like myself.\n\nThey say pale folk shouldn't walk these streets after dark. Words born of old fears, old hatreds deeper than skin. Maybe it's my own darkness that lets me pass, or maybe the Hill knows its own. Knows those who understand the weight of history, the poison of fear and ignorance that runs through this supposed utopia like bile in the veins.\n\nThis is home now. These streets where strangers offer warmth more often than violence. Where washhouse keepers keep doors open against the rain, where concrete storefronts shelter the lost until some passerby stops, extends a hand holding crumpled dollars, speaks words of worth into the void.\n\nThe Hill remembers. The concrete remembers. The people remember. And in their remembering lies truth darker than night and brighter than dawn.",
            "When I first come to this place I was just a boy. Eighth grade. The houses stood like silent sentinels in the fading light of summer, two stories tall and identical save for the paint and trim that marked each dwelling from its neighbor. Two houses down lived a boy who'd become something like a brother to me. Another lived further up the street. Both gone now but the memories remain like photographs bleached by the sun, preserved in amber.\n\nThe same folk who dwelled here then dwell here still. A suburban tract no different from ten thousand others scattered across this vast land. The sounds of children at play echo through the streets when the weather turns warm, their laughter carrying on the wind like birdsong. Quiet most days. The kind of quiet that settles deep in your bones. Never had no trouble with the neighbors. They mind their business less you need help, and packages left on porches stay where they're meant to. Trust runs deep here like an underground stream.\n\nThere's a park nearby. Not more than a minute's walk. Played ball there countless times. Basketball. Football. Baseball. Got my nose broke there once playing football but that's just one dark thread in a tapestry of brighter moments. These days I take my cousin's young ones there. They're small yet, still finding joy in swings and slides, their eyes lighting up at the mere mention of the place. Makes something stir in my chest when I go there now. Memory perhaps. Or maybe just the ghost of what used to be.\n\nThe neighborhood's a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth within walking distance. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All of it there for the taking though most folks these days just tap their phones and wait for dinner to arrive at their door like magic. Fast food joints too, same as anywhere else, and pizza places scattered like seeds in the wind.\n\nGot everything a body might need. Dry cleaners. Drug stores standing across from each other like duelists at dawn. A Jewel-Osco where the midwest folk get their groceries. Even got an Indian store where you can find spices that smell like distant lands.\n\nReading about other neighborhoods, hearing tales of strife and discord, makes me grateful for this place. This quiet corner of the world where people still look out for one another. Where trust ain't just a word but something real you can hold onto like a rope in the dark.",
            "The neighborhood lay close to the college where I studied, a place of concrete and brick rising from cracked earth. Apartment buildings stood like ancient monoliths, their faces weathered and gray. Between them bars and eating houses squatted low against the ground, their neon signs humming in the night like tired insects. They'd renamed one of the bars not long past. More costly now but the liquor still poured.\n\nThe people here existed in two tribes. Students with their bright faces and clean clothes, and the others, the ones who lived in the cheaper units where the rent didnt break them. Children too, many of them, drawn to the elementary school that rose up from behind chain link and dead grass.\n\nMy neighbors I knew only by the sweet smoke that crept beneath their door. Management had mounted some mechanical thing that spat perfume into the hall. A joke really. But there wasnt much funny about this place. Old buildings with fresh paint inside trying to hide what they truly were. Down the way they'd built new ones, cheap things made of particle board and promises, charging gold prices for tin accommodations. But they could. They knew they could.\n\nA restaurant sat five minutes walking distance, serving microwaved dreams on paper plates. Across from it a gas station where souls went to die working minimum wage. The city had come through with money, laid new concrete for walking, planted grass in strips between the road. Made it look civilized. But our building stood back in the trees, some cut down to stumps like broken teeth in a dead man's mouth. Behind us forty-third street ran parallel, a meaner place where sidewalks broke apart like dried mud and buildings crouched behind their screens of leaves. Crime lived there. Though it lived everywhere really, even in the complex across from us where people came and went like shadows in the night.\n\nBut it was home. Affordable. Close enough to walk to class. Two bus stops that could carry you to market or downtown. A place to exist while the world turned its slow circle toward whatever end awaited us all.",
            "The duplexes stood in their yellow paint and white porches like sentinels in the dying light, green metal roofs catching what remained of the sun. A cul-de-sac where folk gathered in the gloaming, standing in driveways not chosen but found, speaking low while children drew their chalk figures on the concrete and sent their kites up into the darkening sky. Like some memory of a time before the world grew cold with its machines and screens casting their blue light on empty faces.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up against a sky that carried clouds white as bone. But the weather turned mean as it does in these parts. Sirens wailed their warning into the night and folk scattered to their shelters like leaves before a storm. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and what possessions seemed to matter, while the big one paced and barked at something it couldn't name. The hail came then, beating against the earth like God's own dice. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing its last, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five like a stone dropped in deep water. The hail melted where it touched the blacktop and then the sun broke through and the rain came again and with it two rainbows arced across the sky like some covenant made new.\n\nThe streets lay quiet for a time, then life crept back. Women and children emerged like creatures from their burrows, the smell of cooking riding the evening air. All of it strange to me, come down from the north where folk speak different. Each house the same outside but different within, some small as coffins though you wouldn't know it. Behind my place lies a field and beyond that a pond where no one swims. Deer move through the morning mist and bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters call across the dawn and in the evening a donkey brays his lonesome song. Like some forgotten corner of the world where time moves slower and folk still know their neighbors. Found this place like finding an old coin in the dirt, something precious that someone lost or left behind.",
            "Ten years gone now in this place. Time stretches like a dark road with no end. Memory carries me back to that first day when we crossed over from Riverdale to Stockbridge, tears marking their path down my young face like rain on a windowpane. Mama and daddy, they had their reasons. Better schools they said. Better houses. A place where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nThe years rolled past like dead leaves in autumn wind. Made friends. Made enemies too. Most neighbors stayed strangers except for Mr. Glen and Dennis, living in their houses next to ours like sentinels in the night. Mr. Glen's wedding stays with me still. His new bride Ms. Veda in white, pure as driven snow. When she threw that little white strap from her leg it found its way to my hands like it was meant to be there. We danced that night, me and Marsharii, his daughter. Never saw her after. The world takes what it wants.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a maze of concrete and asphalt. GPS helps now but back then it was wild territory. Me and Kason and Curtis, we'd venture out like explorers in some ancient land, controllers in hand instead of compasses, marking time with pixels and sound.\n\nThe park became my sanctuary. Nature speaking in tongues only the soul can understand. I'd bring my wooden sword and balance sticks from the hardware store, practicing forms like some warrior monk in exile. Tennis courts and basketball hoops stand sentinel, unused now but waiting. Daddy and Mr. Graves, they taught us tennis in those days. Worked us till our muscles screamed but we smiled through it all.\n\nMemory is a cruel thing. It keeps what it wants and discards the rest like ashes in the wind. But these memories, they stay. They root deep like old trees. And somewhere out there in the darkness ahead, more memories wait to be made. God willing, if he's still watching.",
            "Johnston lay quiet in the South Carolina heat, a town no different from any other save for the peach trees that gave it its name. The Peach Capital of the World the sign said and the words stood there faded and proud against the merciless sun. Fields stretched out beyond sight, dotted with peach orchards or cattle standing black against the sky like ancient cave paintings come to life.\n\nThe houses set back from the road, metal roofs gleaming like shields or gray shingles dulled by time and weather. They stood apart from one another as if in mutual wariness, fields between them given over to beast or crop or sometimes nothing at all. In town a single stoplight swung above the crossroads, marking the heart of what commerce existed here.\n\nThree places to eat. The Hong Kong where a single family worked in silence. The Fiesta where Mexican music played soft and tired. Gary's with its burgers wrapped in wax paper gone translucent with grease. The pizzeria long gone now, its windows blank as dead eyes.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug still stood, known more for its cherry cola than any medicine it might dispense. The IGA grocery sat expensive and lonesome, folk choosing instead to make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General thrived like a weed in poor soil, its fluorescent lights drawing people like moths until closing time.\n\nThe furniture store called Possibilities had stood so long nobody remembered when it wasnt there, run by a woman whose kindness seemed a relic of some other time. Next door the pet groomers cleaned and cut and kept the animals of those who could afford such things. A doctor and a vet practiced their arts in separate buildings away from town, tending to what ills flesh might manifest.\n\nThe elementary school stood silent in summer, its children gone to middle and high school in the next town over like young birds pushed from the nest. They spoke of building a park, two and a half acres of manufactured joy, but for now the land lay empty as it had since time out of mind.\n\nNo theater here. No bowling alley. No place for youth to gather and dream of escape. Just the road through town, so quick a traveler might pass through between blinks and never know they'd been anywhere at all.",
            "The road cuts between two highways like a vein between arteries, the traffic moving past our house in perpetual motion, a reminder of the world beyond. We inhabit this corner where the street bends, watching the parade of metal and rubber that marks the passage of days. The neighbors we know by their vehicles, their faces, their routines. Strange cars draw our eyes like carrion birds to fresh kill.\n\nThe neighborhood stands as it has, houses rooted deep in what was once woodland. Trees tower above, their shadows pooling dark across yards where children pedal their bicycles in endless circles. Four souls dwell in our house - myself, the woman who shares my bed, and two girls, one eleven winters, the other fourteen. We remain close to home, our work tethered to these walls.\n\nThe seasons mark themselves in sounds. Lawnmowers drone from spring through fall, their mechanical growl echoing across fenced yards like some primitive ritual. When autumn comes the leaves descend, golden and rust-colored harbingers of winter. We burn them in piles, the smoke carrying memories of childhood into the gray sky. Winter has grown weak here, more ghost than season, leaving autumn to stretch like a dying man across the calendar.\n\nOur garage stands sentinel at the back of the house, the front door forgotten save for rare visitors who announce themselves with knuckles against wood. With the garage doors yawning open, I work on my truck, feeling the pulse of the neighborhood through the concrete floor. Metal against metal, tools speaking their own language.\n\nHolidays bring strange cars and foreign faces, relatives flooding the streets like water seeking low ground. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Mother's Day - the rhythm of family gathering and dispersing again, like waves against a shore. The neighborhood breathes these changes in and out.\n\nThis street serves as corridor between larger roads, and there lies its single flaw. But we abide here still, watching the world pass by our corner, marking time by the shadows of trees and the sound of children at play. It is not perfect, but it is ours.",
            "The land stretches brown and endless, dirt piled upon dirt like some ancient god's discarded earthworks. Unless you walked these grounds yourself you dont know what it means to see nothing but brown spreading out before you like a dead sea, and when you spy a patch of green lawn somewhere you know that man has paid dearly for his small victory over the desert. Time was in the nineties when houses stood far apart like sentinels in the waste but now they cluster closer though the spaces between still yawn wide and empty. The city grows like a cancer. Most places do.\n\nGood folk and bad folk both walk these streets same as anywhere. Round my place its mostly old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind screen doors. The stores aint much to speak of, just them chain outfits, Food For Less and such. Anything fancy means driving and driving far. No Whole Foods here. Construction work feeds most families, hammers ringing out across empty lots waiting to be filled. Sometimes that sound keeps me awake thinking about how the open spaces are dying. I ran from the big city once. Dont aim to live in another.\n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and ceiling work, following the build like them others. But its the animals make this place home. Folk come here for different reasons but mostly its the stark beauty does it, the way the desert just lies there naked under the sky. Different creatures live here, things that learned to survive in the heat and dust. People ought to learn about them, learn to live alongside them proper. My young ones, they took to it natural. Three of them out there now hunting lizards and beetles in the dust like little savages.\n\nThe county fair comes through sometimes. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like old men's beards and folk go up there to slide down them on boards. Down in the museum they keep bits of old bones and Indian things behind glass, telling stories about how this place came to be what it is. But mostly its just the desert and us, living in it day by day, watching the brown earth stretch away toward mountains that stand like ancient teeth against the sky.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some concrete vision of hell. Gray buildings rising up from the ashen earth, their windows dead and lightless in the morning sun. He thinks on how this place aint like other neighborhoods folk might speak of. No white picket fences here. No children's bicycles left carelessly in driveways. This here's different. This here's where he dwells.\n\nThe dormitory stands like a concrete monolith against the pale sky. Inside its bowels students sleep and wake and dream their dreams. Two to a cell mostly, packed in tight like prisoners serving time. The apartments aint much different. Twenty souls or thereabouts to each building, stacked two floors high like some architectural mockery of hope.\n\nThen there's the houses. Real houses. Alumni dwelling places scattered bout like bones bleached white in the sun. Two bedrooms. Sometimes four. Not many though. Efficiency aint in their nature and the powers that be know it well enough.\n\nThe people here. Lord the people here. They come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds moving through the concrete maze like blood through veins. Professional types in their pressed shirts occupying the houses while the young ones, green as spring corn, crowd the dormitories. The older students take to the apartments like refugees seeking higher ground.\n\nStores dot the landscape like pustules on diseased skin. Food places mostly. Clothing shops bearing the school's mark like brands on cattle. A grocery too. Everything a body might need within these borders, he reckons. And the park. One single park standing defiant against the spread of concrete and steel. Clean they keep it. Safe too. Though he wonders sometimes if anything in this world can truly be called safe anymore.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood. But it's his. And in the end that's all that matters in this godless place they call education.",
            "There aint no sidewalks here. Everything runs down like water finding its way to the sea and our house sits atop the highest ridge where the wind comes cold and constant. They call it the workout hill on account of the runners who come daily to test themselves against its grade. Folk walk in the road because there aint nowhere else to walk. The blacktop's scarred and pocked like an old man's face, treacherous to them that dont know its ways. Above hang the wires, twisted and spliced and mended a hundred times over from storms that come without warning or mercy. The trees stand tall and dark, evergreens stretching toward a gray heaven, but the people here hate them for blocking their view of the water and cut them down whenever they can. Houses rise up like glass-faced sentinels, each trying to peer over the shoulder of the one before it to catch a glimpse of the bay below.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns like molten copper but most days the clouds hang low and heavy, wrapping everything in a perpetual twilight. The moss claims whatever stands still long enough, painting the world in shades of green. Left my truck idle for a month once and found it transformed into something ancient and primordial, took hours to reclaim it from the green.\n\nAint many children here though theres a school close by. Old folk mostly, retired and waiting. Dogs run free instead of children, appearing like ghosts in yards and doorways. Found one in my living room once, standing there like it owned the place. Rabbits too, big as cats some of them, digging up gardens til my cats got to hunting them down. Birds wheel overhead - tiny ones that flit between branches and great raptors that the crows drive off like army squadrons protecting their territory.\n\nNo stores nearby but down by the water where the land gives way to stone there's places that serve up what the bay provides. The beach aint much but the rocks make good missiles to hurl into the gray waters. The opposite shore stands clear most days through the mist like some promised land we cant quite reach.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some great beast sprawled across Brooklyn, its concrete arteries pulsing with the blood of subway trains running deep beneath the earth. The streets stretched out before you like the fingers of a dead man's hand, each one lined with two-story houses standing shoulder to shoulder in their eternal vigil.\n\nThe Asians had come. Twenty years past they'd settled here and made it their own. Their stores rose up from the sidewalks like mushrooms after rain, signs in languages that looked like broken birds scattered across storefronts. Markets and laundries mostly. Four such markets within sight of each other, their produce spilling out onto the concrete in wooden crates. Good food and cheap too. The kind of places where old women would barter in tongues unknown.\n\nThe park stood renovated and raw. Basketball courts stretched out like graves, ten of them, and beyond that the soccer field lay green and vast. Children played there in the summer heat, their dark faces glistening under the spray of water fountains. All colors of mankind gathered there, their children mingling like drops of paint in a vast palette.\n\nNo towers here. No glass and steel monuments to greed. Just the low buildings squatting in their own shadows. Co-ops and condos rose up here and there but mostly it was the two-family houses, packed tight like books on a shelf. The streets never slept. Music blasted from passing cars like the war cries of mechanical beasts, engines roaring in the night like demons unleashed from some automotive hell.\n\nNight brought its own terrors. The darkness held teeth and claws, thieves and bullies prowling like coyotes. He remembered the beating he'd taken years ago, remembered the taste of blood and concrete. These days the thieves took packages instead of blood, but the darkness remained unchanged.\n\nDog shit everywhere. Like some biblical plague visited upon the sidewalks. No matter the fines, no matter the laws, it lay there in wait every morning. A reminder perhaps that even in this concrete wilderness, nature would have its say. The city had tried to tame it with ordinances and threats but still it remained, testament to man's eternal struggle against the base and primal things that lurked at the edges of civilization.",
            "You got to understand what weird means in Portland Oregon. Aint no simple thing. Up on that old building where they serve pizza and liquor and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws quiet-like, the words stand stark against the gray sky: Keep Portland Weird. Some folk remember it different, back before the money came, when weird meant something pure and raw in the rain-soaked streets. Others hear it like a calling, come here where your strangeness aint no burden to bear.\n\nThe Californians keep coming. Building their glass towers reaching up into the perpetual clouds like fingers of some desperate god. But the weird persists. Not the kind that welcomes all, mind you, but the kind that takes in what others cast out. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in every store, same fights, same troubles. Got our share of normal too - them yoga folk and hipsters in their tight pants and the business types with their clean shoes. Maybe we just dont hold so tight to the pretending.\n\nWhere I stay at, houses painted like fever dreams. Gardens growing wild right up through the concrete, herbs and flowers fighting for space with the vegetables. Come summer the free boxes appear like mushrooms after rain. Cardboard prophecies filled with castoff dreams. Books and clothes mostly, but sometimes treasures that seem placed there by some knowing hand, waiting for the right soul to pass by.\n\nThe rain it comes and stays. Dark clouds hanging low enough to touch, bringing with them the shadows in mens minds. Got them that chase dragons in the streets, them that sleep under bridges cause theres nowhere else to go. Services better than most places but still aint enough. Never is. The people who got homes, they swing between mercy and hate like a broken compass seeking true north.\n\nThe soccer crowds fill the streets some days. Other folk bend themselves into shapes while goats walk on their backs. Each to their own peculiar worship. Some chase dreams, others drown them in beer glasses. All of us weird in our own way, or maybe none of us weird at all. Just people trying to make sense of the world in this corner of it, where the rain falls more days than not and the weird aint so much a choice as it is the air we breathe.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. North they rise like ancient gods bearing witness to the coming and going of light. A man might forget them in the blur of days and toil but they remain, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of men. And when the weight of living bears down heavy they command attention and in their presence a soul might find rest, might draw strength enough to weather one more dawn, one more dusk. \n\nI came here young, barely more than a boy, drawn to those northern peaks that loomed above the campus grounds. The university itself held beauty in its way, old buildings and still ponds and trees that had seen a hundred summers come and go, but the mountains ruled over all like silent kings. The town spread below them like a supplicant, all brick and mortar weathered by time. Coffee houses where students hunched over books in the small hours, their faces pale in the fluorescent light. The downtown streets where old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their facades speaking of times long past when men believed in permanence. There the city showed its teeth, its vigor, but it didnt last. Beyond the library the quiet returned like a tide.\n\nThe city was two things at once, busy and still, loud and quiet. A man could lose himself in its streets and find himself again. Memory clung to every corner like cobwebs. Good memories of walking past rusted playground swings with friends when the night was old, of running through crowded streets to catch pictures at the theater. But darker memories too, the kind that haunt a man in the small hours. Id stood by those ponds watching turtles and waterfowl going about their business while I searched for meaning in my own existence. Id shed tears there at two in the morning when the weight of living grew too heavy.\n\nOne morning I walked past the pond, past the park with its neat houses standing in rows like headstones. I walked until I reached the main road. The sun was coming up, painting the sky in fire, setting the palm fronds ablaze with light. I looked north. There they stood as they had always stood, those mountains older than memory, their peaks cutting into the dawn sky like knives. They spoke without speaking, and in their presence I found the will to endure.",
            "You wouldnt see it first off. Just houses behind some stores. Not the kind of place folk'd choose to dwell in. But go on past that dead Whole Foods building, past them hotels that only fill when summer brings the families back like migrating birds, and there's life there. Real life. Streets lined with apartment buildings stood up like old dominos waiting to fall, all in a row neat as you please. First ones got trouble in em. Been in the papers. We wont speak on that. But them others next door and the ones after, they're different somehow. Like stepping into another world entirely.\n\nCross the way there's this college. Small thing. Just some buildings keeping watch over the road where sleepy students drift in with their coffee cups at dawn. Iron gates scream on their hinges letting em through while folks in cars curse the delay, their fists raised up like flags of surrender to the morning.\n\nRoad ends at another, T-shaped like a gallows. Park on one side. Other side's got this place where broken people go to mend. Got chairs out front where nobody sits and a fan that just pushes the thick air around and around like God stirring soup.\n\nChildren spin in the grass like fallen leaves. Bees drift drunk between flowers. Old folk walk their dogs, eyeing the skateboard kids like they was carrying plague, nodding to girls bunched up by the swings talking about whatever girls talk about these days.\n\nStrip mall's got this sushi place. Empty mostly. Swimming store next door. Nail place between. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish. There's this yogurt shop too where kids go to feel grown, sucking sugar through plastic straws and blowing vapor in the air like they was dragons in a fairy tale.\n\nWhole place is like some picture of America that got stuck in time. South moving slow as molasses, holding onto what it knows, refusing to let go. Time dont mean much here. Never did.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels of some forgotten age. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins in their death throes. Small patches of yard lay before each dwelling and strips of concrete they called driveways stretched alongside like pale fingers reaching for something long gone. These were the remnants of that old dream. The American dream they'd called it. It had wrapped itself round the throat of a nation and now was slowly loosening its grip leaving only these neighborhoods behind. Testament to what was. What might have been.\n\nThe yards aint kept like they once were and the people's eyes dont shine with that old light but still the machines rest in the driveways like sleeping beasts and still the young ones play in the street like there aint nothing else in all the world that matters. The schoolhouse stands yet. Ninety years of brick and mortar promising futures it maybe cant deliver no more while stirring up ghosts in them that's old enough to remember. Churches scattered and empty but the basketball courts full of life like blood pooling in the wounds of a dying thing.\n\nHouses different as brothers but carrying the same blood. That market run by them Yemen folk, probably the only Arab blood for miles in this sea of black faces. Streets wide as rivers where children play their games, pausing only when the cars come through like metal leviathans. Most folks been here since there was a here to be in. They'll tell you tales of when everybody knew everybody else's name and business too.\n\nWhere the karate school once stood now there's a pharmacy. Seems fitting somehow. Dreams of being the karate kid replaced by little white pills that make the dreams go away altogether. The picture show still runs, showing yesterday's stories at yesterday's prices. The young ones dont go there no more but the old folks, they remember.\n\nThat expressway cuts through like a concrete snake but it dont stop here. They tried once to make it stop. Young blood wanted it, old blood didn't. Old blood won out like it usually does in matters such as these. They're raising up a new school now and talking about what creature should stand for what they are. But how do you capture what cant be captured? How do you draw the shape of a dying dream?",
            "The city sprawls vast and restless, a thing alive and breathing with its own dark pulse. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a perpetual haze of exhaust and industry, their windows dead and lightless in the afternoon glare. Streets wind through the maze of steel and glass, some broad as rivers, others narrow as cattle chutes, all of them gorged with vehicles moving slow as blood through dying veins.\n\nThe people here exist in their separate tribes though sometimes they intersect like old migratory paths crossing in the waste. Orthodox Jews in their black hats and coats move like shadows through the streets while nearby rainbow flags hang limp and faded above doorways where the queer folk gather. Further out lie the ethnic boroughs - Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia - each one a world contained within itself, each speaking in tongues foreign to the others.\n\nHe remembered playing in these streets as a child, back when neighbors still knew one another's names and children ran wild in the gathering dusk. But those days were long dead now. The city had swallowed such things. Now apartment towers rose like concrete mushrooms after rain, their residents stacked in steel boxes reaching toward a sky they'd never touch. Traffic choked the arteries of the city day and night. Ten miles might take two hours to traverse, the vehicles crawling bumper to bumper like a funeral procession with no end and no beginning.\n\nConstruction cranes turned slow circles overhead, building more towers, more boxes to house the endless waves of newcomers drawn to this place like moths to flame. The old residents watched with dead eyes as their city transformed, as parking spaces became scarce as water in the desert, as the streets grew more crowded with each passing season.\n\nHouses still stood in places, holdouts from an older time. Single family homes and duplexes hunched between the towers like dying breeds facing extinction. But they too would fall in time. The city was hungry and patient. It would consume everything in the end. That's what cities do. They feed and grow and change until nothing remains of what once was. Until even memory fades like old photographs left too long in the sun.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn, the fields stretching out into nothing. This is it, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The corn went on and on like some biblical plague, row after row until the horizon swallowed them whole. I told her bout growing up here in this emptiness, this Ohio nowhere, and something in her eyes changed like she finally understood the making of me.\n\nPast the waterlogged quarry you come to where the houses stand. Brick and stucco dwellings each with its plot of ground that folk tend like their own small kingdoms. Come spring the flowers rise up out of the earth and the trees shed their winter bones for new flesh. Mercedes automobiles gleam in driveways like chrome beacons, proud testimonies to prosperity in this heartland waste.\n\nThe Korean lives next door, ancient now but still singing while he rides his mower in endless circles. Once was a doctor they say though now he's just the old man who tends the grass, moving slow like some ritual dance between the property lines. Time has taken pieces of his mind but left his gentle nature intact.\n\nOur house stands gray against the sky. Geese patrol the yard while the terrier gives chase, both caught in some eternal game neither can win. The stream out back feeds the quarry, carrying with it the sounds of frogs and distant cattle lowing in the dark. Cross the wooden bridge we built with our hands and you'll find what's left of the wild world. Trees stand sentinel over herbs and flowers that grew according to no man's plan. Here's where childhood lived, where we built our wooden fortresses in the trees and played at being hunters though we never killed nothing worth killing.\n\nWinter comes harsh as judgment to this land. The yard that was green turns to emptiness, trees stripped to bone and sinew against the gray sky. Snow comes like a blessing some nights, turning all to white silence. My sister would leave her angels pressed in the snow while we waged our wars with frozen ammunition, building walls of ice and stick like we could hold back time itself. We were gods then in our small kingdom, when nothing mattered but the game and the next handful of snow and the sound of our own laughter echoing across the frozen waste."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "They call this place Rural America though that aint what it is. Not really. Small town Michigan where the farmland bleeds into tourist towns like blood seeping into cotton. No malls here. No Walmart. No chain restaurants with their neon signs bleeding into the night. Just miles of road stretching between anywhere you need to be.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold something ancient and true. Lake Michigan vast and gray to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, like twin mirrors reflecting whatever truth God left behind. Beaches everywhere you turn, sand and stone waiting for footprints that the water will wash away come morning.\n\nThe neighborhood aint like them suburbs where houses stand shoulder to shoulder like prisoners. These homes got history in their bones. Some fixed up nice, others wearing their age like medals. Most got basements you can see from the street, concrete testimonials to what lies beneath. Aluminum siding gone gray or blue or whatever color folks chose when hope still meant something.\n\nYards spread out like promises. Trampolines standing dark against the sky, swing sets creaking in the wind. Gardens where people still believe things can grow. Fences holding dogs that bark at shadows. These houses speak of work and family and the kind of tired that comes honest.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things, their voices carrying on the wind. Dog walkers and bikers move like ghosts through the evening light. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. Someone's always cooking outside, smoke rising up like prayers. Someone's always waving, smiling, pretending the world aint what it is.\n\nThe lawns stay trim, leaves dont gather. Everything maintained like keeping order might keep chaos at bay. It aint beautiful the way money makes things beautiful, but it's got truth in it. Safety. The kind of place where you can sleep without one eye open.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, and the health department. The recycling center where people bring what's left of things. Baseball fields echo with voices calling names into the darkness. The airport sends its metal birds into the sky, their engines growling like distant thunder. Ice cream shop still standing like it has since before any of us were born. Downtown just a walk away, though walking aint what folks do much anymore.\n\nThe children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through what's left of America. And maybe that's what makes it good. Maybe that's what makes it true. This place. This small piece of what we pretend the world still is.",
            "The houses stood like grave markers in that suburban waste. All of them the same. All of them built to some godless specification laid down by men who'd never set foot on the land. The homeowner's association saw to that. There was grass cut low and stone scattered about and driveways so short a man could cross them in three steps. Small trees dotted the landscape like sentries. Two-car garages lined the streets like empty eye sockets staring into nothing.\n\nThe roads were smooth. Too smooth. No potholes nor cracks marred their perfect surface. As if the earth beneath refused to claim them. Single story dwellings mostly though some rose higher, reaching toward a sky that cared nothing for their aspirations. No mailboxes stood before these houses. Instead they gathered in clusters at the street's end, metal boxes requiring keys, like jail cells for paper and parcels.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the city's edge where civilization met wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land stretched out beyond sight. Swimming pools imprisoned behind iron gates. Walking trails snaked through the emptiness like the tracks of some ancient serpent. You could walk them till your feet bled and never see the same ground twice. \n\nThe old ones lived there mostly. Retirees who'd come to die in peace. Some younger folk too, with their pressed shirts and clean cars. All of them pretending at community, at safety. They watched each other's houses and spoke of brotherhood but they knew nothing of true watching, true brotherhood.\n\nThe city beyond was vast but played at being small. One mall stood like a monument to commerce. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to stores that sold food both costly and cheap. Organic produce displayed like jewels in one place, bare shelves and skeleton crews in another. All of it meaningless. All of it temporary.\n\nThe neighborhood endured. Clean. Safe. Empty of soul. The pools reflected nothing. The trails led nowhere. And the houses stood watching, waiting for something that would never come.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the lost ones, crackling through wire and static like spirits caught between worlds. Strange thing it was. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each turning of the moon and none who lived there knew anything of such tales. Maybe it was the weight of living pressing down. Known folk who'd weep in the nighttime hours when sleep wouldn't come. Everything dear now but we learned to scrape by, year on year.\n\nYou come to know the smell of secondhand things. Smell of dust and age on toys and clothes pulled from darkness. Childhood has its scents but they fade. Some take to tobacco, others just forget what was. But the markets of the poor remain. Adulthood smells of yellowed paper stacked on dead pianos, leather that holds memories even after the washing. Three stores of cast-off things within walking. Starting far out you can trace a path through charity shops, past the library where old books sleep, through curio shops where time stands still.\n\nDowntown's thick with metal and flesh, morning till night, but in those shops silence rules deep as death. Good place to lose yourself when the hours grow long. Each year brings more. Cars and bodies flood the streets like rivers of chrome and bone. Growing city, they say. Some great empire of the digital age making its home here, spreading like a cancer. Makes me think of New York. Everyone chasing their own ghosts, asking nothing of nobody. You can wrap yourself in solitude and none will try to breach it. Not like down South where concern masquerades as kindness. Here you keep your walls high as you please and the city breaks against them like dark water on stone.\n\nLife moves all around. Piano man next door, singers above, their sounds carrying through walls thin as paper. Less strangers now than something like kin. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Found something like fortune here. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean my trace, share what food comes my way, carry their letters like messages between camps. Good to see them, good to be seen. Living in this concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make me think I ain't damned my soul entirely.",
            "The town lay just beyond the reach of the city's sprawl, a small midwestern place where the east side bore the mark of poverty like an old wound. Houses stood weather-beaten and dim, most occupied by those who had little, yet they endured. Not an ugly place. No. The people there would nod and speak when you passed, their faces carrying something of the old world's courtesy despite what time and circumstance had written upon them.\n\nViolence visited sometimes, though not often. In the past years there had been shootings, a killing or two within walking distance. The neighbors boy, shot dead outside a bar not a year past. They heard the shots perhaps, or maybe just the sirens after. Things disappeared from porches in the night. Small things. Left out like offerings to whatever gods still walked these streets.\n\nThe opioid scourge had touched this place same as everywhere. Fentanyl claiming souls like some dark harvester moving through the corn. They had places for the addicted though. Centers where they tried to pull them back from that precipice. People learning to push life back into the dead with Narcan, like some grim resurrection.\n\nThe boy's school stood as a sanctuary. Good people there. Teachers who understood. No child went hungry, all fed same as the next without regard to what their people could pay. The boy, different from the others but loved all the same, found peace there among the chaos of childhood.\n\nThe town council had tried to paint beauty over decay. New roads laid down, parks restored, gardens planted. But their attention turned always to the west side where the money flowed, where commerce still breathed. The east side waited, patient as stone, for care that never came.\n\nSixteen years in this place. The house wasn't much but it held warmth and memories like a vessel. Home was what it was. What it had always been. They couldn't imagine another. Sometimes at night he'd stand on the porch looking out over the neighborhood, watching porch lights wink out one by one, thinking how this place had become the story of their lives, for better or worse, until whatever end waited for them all.",
            "The neighborhood sets upon the hill like some ancient monument to time forgotten. Seven stories up I dwell across from where the theater stands weathered and proud, its marquee dead these many years. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather round arcade machines while neon burns holes in the night. Summer brings them like pilgrims, standing patient in lines that snake down sidewalks worn smooth by countless feet before.\n\nThe park lies north. Concrete walls rise up round it, steps carved like teeth in the gray face of stone. Winter brings the wanderers, their tents clustered close as dying animals seeking warmth against the rain that falls without cease. Not snow here but water eternal, drumming on canvas, seeping into bones. They gather near the shelter where steam rises from showers like spirits fleeing flesh.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks truth here. Not the proud buildings nor the hills that roll like waves toward the distant sea. It's the people carrying memories like scars. Tales of when Hilltop ran red with gang wars, when federal men swept through like dark angels bearing badges and guns. These stories pass like scripture from fathers to sons, mothers to daughters, old residents to new blood like myself.\n\nThey say pale folk shouldn't walk these streets after dark. Words born of old fears, old hatreds deeper than skin. Maybe it's my own darkness that lets me pass, or maybe the Hill knows its own. Knows those who understand the weight of history, the poison of fear and ignorance that runs through this supposed utopia like bile in the veins.\n\nThis is home now. These streets where strangers offer warmth more often than violence. Where washhouse keepers keep doors open against the rain, where concrete storefronts shelter the lost until some passerby stops, extends a hand holding crumpled dollars, speaks words of worth into the void.\n\nThe Hill remembers. The concrete remembers. The people remember. And in their remembering lies truth darker than night and brighter than dawn.",
            "When I first come to this place I was just a boy. Eighth grade. The houses stood like silent sentinels in the fading light of summer, two stories tall and identical save for the paint and trim that marked each dwelling from its neighbor. Two houses down lived a boy who'd become something like a brother to me. Another lived further up the street. Both gone now but the memories remain like photographs bleached by the sun, preserved in amber.\n\nThe same folk who dwelled here then dwell here still. A suburban tract no different from ten thousand others scattered across this vast land. The sounds of children at play echo through the streets when the weather turns warm, their laughter carrying on the wind like birdsong. Quiet most days. The kind of quiet that settles deep in your bones. Never had no trouble with the neighbors. They mind their business less you need help, and packages left on porches stay where they're meant to. Trust runs deep here like an underground stream.\n\nThere's a park nearby. Not more than a minute's walk. Played ball there countless times. Basketball. Football. Baseball. Got my nose broke there once playing football but that's just one dark thread in a tapestry of brighter moments. These days I take my cousin's young ones there. They're small yet, still finding joy in swings and slides, their eyes lighting up at the mere mention of the place. Makes something stir in my chest when I go there now. Memory perhaps. Or maybe just the ghost of what used to be.\n\nThe neighborhood's a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth within walking distance. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All of it there for the taking though most folks these days just tap their phones and wait for dinner to arrive at their door like magic. Fast food joints too, same as anywhere else, and pizza places scattered like seeds in the wind.\n\nGot everything a body might need. Dry cleaners. Drug stores standing across from each other like duelists at dawn. A Jewel-Osco where the midwest folk get their groceries. Even got an Indian store where you can find spices that smell like distant lands.\n\nReading about other neighborhoods, hearing tales of strife and discord, makes me grateful for this place. This quiet corner of the world where people still look out for one another. Where trust ain't just a word but something real you can hold onto like a rope in the dark.",
            "The neighborhood lay close to the college where I studied, a place of concrete and brick rising from cracked earth. Apartment buildings stood like ancient monoliths, their faces weathered and gray. Between them bars and eating houses squatted low against the ground, their neon signs humming in the night like tired insects. They'd renamed one of the bars not long past. More costly now but the liquor still poured.\n\nThe people here existed in two tribes. Students with their bright faces and clean clothes, and the others, the ones who lived in the cheaper units where the rent didnt break them. Children too, many of them, drawn to the elementary school that rose up from behind chain link and dead grass.\n\nMy neighbors I knew only by the sweet smoke that crept beneath their door. Management had mounted some mechanical thing that spat perfume into the hall. A joke really. But there wasnt much funny about this place. Old buildings with fresh paint inside trying to hide what they truly were. Down the way they'd built new ones, cheap things made of particle board and promises, charging gold prices for tin accommodations. But they could. They knew they could.\n\nA restaurant sat five minutes walking distance, serving microwaved dreams on paper plates. Across from it a gas station where souls went to die working minimum wage. The city had come through with money, laid new concrete for walking, planted grass in strips between the road. Made it look civilized. But our building stood back in the trees, some cut down to stumps like broken teeth in a dead man's mouth. Behind us forty-third street ran parallel, a meaner place where sidewalks broke apart like dried mud and buildings crouched behind their screens of leaves. Crime lived there. Though it lived everywhere really, even in the complex across from us where people came and went like shadows in the night.\n\nBut it was home. Affordable. Close enough to walk to class. Two bus stops that could carry you to market or downtown. A place to exist while the world turned its slow circle toward whatever end awaited us all.",
            "The duplexes stood in their yellow paint and white porches like sentinels in the dying light, green metal roofs catching what remained of the sun. A cul-de-sac where folk gathered in the gloaming, standing in driveways not chosen but found, speaking low while children drew their chalk figures on the concrete and sent their kites up into the darkening sky. Like some memory of a time before the world grew cold with its machines and screens casting their blue light on empty faces.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up against a sky that carried clouds white as bone. But the weather turned mean as it does in these parts. Sirens wailed their warning into the night and folk scattered to their shelters like leaves before a storm. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and what possessions seemed to matter, while the big one paced and barked at something it couldn't name. The hail came then, beating against the earth like God's own dice. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing its last, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five like a stone dropped in deep water. The hail melted where it touched the blacktop and then the sun broke through and the rain came again and with it two rainbows arced across the sky like some covenant made new.\n\nThe streets lay quiet for a time, then life crept back. Women and children emerged like creatures from their burrows, the smell of cooking riding the evening air. All of it strange to me, come down from the north where folk speak different. Each house the same outside but different within, some small as coffins though you wouldn't know it. Behind my place lies a field and beyond that a pond where no one swims. Deer move through the morning mist and bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters call across the dawn and in the evening a donkey brays his lonesome song. Like some forgotten corner of the world where time moves slower and folk still know their neighbors. Found this place like finding an old coin in the dirt, something precious that someone lost or left behind.",
            "Ten years gone now in this place. Time stretches like a dark road with no end. Memory carries me back to that first day when we crossed over from Riverdale to Stockbridge, tears marking their path down my young face like rain on a windowpane. Mama and daddy, they had their reasons. Better schools they said. Better houses. A place where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nThe years rolled past like dead leaves in autumn wind. Made friends. Made enemies too. Most neighbors stayed strangers except for Mr. Glen and Dennis, living in their houses next to ours like sentinels in the night. Mr. Glen's wedding stays with me still. His new bride Ms. Veda in white, pure as driven snow. When she threw that little white strap from her leg it found its way to my hands like it was meant to be there. We danced that night, me and Marsharii, his daughter. Never saw her after. The world takes what it wants.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a maze of concrete and asphalt. GPS helps now but back then it was wild territory. Me and Kason and Curtis, we'd venture out like explorers in some ancient land, controllers in hand instead of compasses, marking time with pixels and sound.\n\nThe park became my sanctuary. Nature speaking in tongues only the soul can understand. I'd bring my wooden sword and balance sticks from the hardware store, practicing forms like some warrior monk in exile. Tennis courts and basketball hoops stand sentinel, unused now but waiting. Daddy and Mr. Graves, they taught us tennis in those days. Worked us till our muscles screamed but we smiled through it all.\n\nMemory is a cruel thing. It keeps what it wants and discards the rest like ashes in the wind. But these memories, they stay. They root deep like old trees. And somewhere out there in the darkness ahead, more memories wait to be made. God willing, if he's still watching.",
            "Johnston lay quiet in the South Carolina heat, a town no different from any other save for the peach trees that gave it its name. The Peach Capital of the World the sign said and the words stood there faded and proud against the merciless sun. Fields stretched out beyond sight, dotted with peach orchards or cattle standing black against the sky like ancient cave paintings come to life.\n\nThe houses set back from the road, metal roofs gleaming like shields or gray shingles dulled by time and weather. They stood apart from one another as if in mutual wariness, fields between them given over to beast or crop or sometimes nothing at all. In town a single stoplight swung above the crossroads, marking the heart of what commerce existed here.\n\nThree places to eat. The Hong Kong where a single family worked in silence. The Fiesta where Mexican music played soft and tired. Gary's with its burgers wrapped in wax paper gone translucent with grease. The pizzeria long gone now, its windows blank as dead eyes.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug still stood, known more for its cherry cola than any medicine it might dispense. The IGA grocery sat expensive and lonesome, folk choosing instead to make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General thrived like a weed in poor soil, its fluorescent lights drawing people like moths until closing time.\n\nThe furniture store called Possibilities had stood so long nobody remembered when it wasnt there, run by a woman whose kindness seemed a relic of some other time. Next door the pet groomers cleaned and cut and kept the animals of those who could afford such things. A doctor and a vet practiced their arts in separate buildings away from town, tending to what ills flesh might manifest.\n\nThe elementary school stood silent in summer, its children gone to middle and high school in the next town over like young birds pushed from the nest. They spoke of building a park, two and a half acres of manufactured joy, but for now the land lay empty as it had since time out of mind.\n\nNo theater here. No bowling alley. No place for youth to gather and dream of escape. Just the road through town, so quick a traveler might pass through between blinks and never know they'd been anywhere at all.",
            "The road cuts between two highways like a vein between arteries, the traffic moving past our house in perpetual motion, a reminder of the world beyond. We inhabit this corner where the street bends, watching the parade of metal and rubber that marks the passage of days. The neighbors we know by their vehicles, their faces, their routines. Strange cars draw our eyes like carrion birds to fresh kill.\n\nThe neighborhood stands as it has, houses rooted deep in what was once woodland. Trees tower above, their shadows pooling dark across yards where children pedal their bicycles in endless circles. Four souls dwell in our house - myself, the woman who shares my bed, and two girls, one eleven winters, the other fourteen. We remain close to home, our work tethered to these walls.\n\nThe seasons mark themselves in sounds. Lawnmowers drone from spring through fall, their mechanical growl echoing across fenced yards like some primitive ritual. When autumn comes the leaves descend, golden and rust-colored harbingers of winter. We burn them in piles, the smoke carrying memories of childhood into the gray sky. Winter has grown weak here, more ghost than season, leaving autumn to stretch like a dying man across the calendar.\n\nOur garage stands sentinel at the back of the house, the front door forgotten save for rare visitors who announce themselves with knuckles against wood. With the garage doors yawning open, I work on my truck, feeling the pulse of the neighborhood through the concrete floor. Metal against metal, tools speaking their own language.\n\nHolidays bring strange cars and foreign faces, relatives flooding the streets like water seeking low ground. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Mother's Day - the rhythm of family gathering and dispersing again, like waves against a shore. The neighborhood breathes these changes in and out.\n\nThis street serves as corridor between larger roads, and there lies its single flaw. But we abide here still, watching the world pass by our corner, marking time by the shadows of trees and the sound of children at play. It is not perfect, but it is ours.",
            "The land stretches brown and endless, dirt piled upon dirt like some ancient god's discarded earthworks. Unless you walked these grounds yourself you dont know what it means to see nothing but brown spreading out before you like a dead sea, and when you spy a patch of green lawn somewhere you know that man has paid dearly for his small victory over the desert. Time was in the nineties when houses stood far apart like sentinels in the waste but now they cluster closer though the spaces between still yawn wide and empty. The city grows like a cancer. Most places do.\n\nGood folk and bad folk both walk these streets same as anywhere. Round my place its mostly old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind screen doors. The stores aint much to speak of, just them chain outfits, Food For Less and such. Anything fancy means driving and driving far. No Whole Foods here. Construction work feeds most families, hammers ringing out across empty lots waiting to be filled. Sometimes that sound keeps me awake thinking about how the open spaces are dying. I ran from the big city once. Dont aim to live in another.\n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and ceiling work, following the build like them others. But its the animals make this place home. Folk come here for different reasons but mostly its the stark beauty does it, the way the desert just lies there naked under the sky. Different creatures live here, things that learned to survive in the heat and dust. People ought to learn about them, learn to live alongside them proper. My young ones, they took to it natural. Three of them out there now hunting lizards and beetles in the dust like little savages.\n\nThe county fair comes through sometimes. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like old men's beards and folk go up there to slide down them on boards. Down in the museum they keep bits of old bones and Indian things behind glass, telling stories about how this place came to be what it is. But mostly its just the desert and us, living in it day by day, watching the brown earth stretch away toward mountains that stand like ancient teeth against the sky.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some concrete vision of hell. Gray buildings rising up from the ashen earth, their windows dead and lightless in the morning sun. He thinks on how this place aint like other neighborhoods folk might speak of. No white picket fences here. No children's bicycles left carelessly in driveways. This here's different. This here's where he dwells.\n\nThe dormitory stands like a concrete monolith against the pale sky. Inside its bowels students sleep and wake and dream their dreams. Two to a cell mostly, packed in tight like prisoners serving time. The apartments aint much different. Twenty souls or thereabouts to each building, stacked two floors high like some architectural mockery of hope.\n\nThen there's the houses. Real houses. Alumni dwelling places scattered bout like bones bleached white in the sun. Two bedrooms. Sometimes four. Not many though. Efficiency aint in their nature and the powers that be know it well enough.\n\nThe people here. Lord the people here. They come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds moving through the concrete maze like blood through veins. Professional types in their pressed shirts occupying the houses while the young ones, green as spring corn, crowd the dormitories. The older students take to the apartments like refugees seeking higher ground.\n\nStores dot the landscape like pustules on diseased skin. Food places mostly. Clothing shops bearing the school's mark like brands on cattle. A grocery too. Everything a body might need within these borders, he reckons. And the park. One single park standing defiant against the spread of concrete and steel. Clean they keep it. Safe too. Though he wonders sometimes if anything in this world can truly be called safe anymore.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood. But it's his. And in the end that's all that matters in this godless place they call education.",
            "There aint no sidewalks here. Everything runs down like water finding its way to the sea and our house sits atop the highest ridge where the wind comes cold and constant. They call it the workout hill on account of the runners who come daily to test themselves against its grade. Folk walk in the road because there aint nowhere else to walk. The blacktop's scarred and pocked like an old man's face, treacherous to them that dont know its ways. Above hang the wires, twisted and spliced and mended a hundred times over from storms that come without warning or mercy. The trees stand tall and dark, evergreens stretching toward a gray heaven, but the people here hate them for blocking their view of the water and cut them down whenever they can. Houses rise up like glass-faced sentinels, each trying to peer over the shoulder of the one before it to catch a glimpse of the bay below.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns like molten copper but most days the clouds hang low and heavy, wrapping everything in a perpetual twilight. The moss claims whatever stands still long enough, painting the world in shades of green. Left my truck idle for a month once and found it transformed into something ancient and primordial, took hours to reclaim it from the green.\n\nAint many children here though theres a school close by. Old folk mostly, retired and waiting. Dogs run free instead of children, appearing like ghosts in yards and doorways. Found one in my living room once, standing there like it owned the place. Rabbits too, big as cats some of them, digging up gardens til my cats got to hunting them down. Birds wheel overhead - tiny ones that flit between branches and great raptors that the crows drive off like army squadrons protecting their territory.\n\nNo stores nearby but down by the water where the land gives way to stone there's places that serve up what the bay provides. The beach aint much but the rocks make good missiles to hurl into the gray waters. The opposite shore stands clear most days through the mist like some promised land we cant quite reach.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some great beast sprawled across Brooklyn, its concrete arteries pulsing with the blood of subway trains running deep beneath the earth. The streets stretched out before you like the fingers of a dead man's hand, each one lined with two-story houses standing shoulder to shoulder in their eternal vigil.\n\nThe Asians had come. Twenty years past they'd settled here and made it their own. Their stores rose up from the sidewalks like mushrooms after rain, signs in languages that looked like broken birds scattered across storefronts. Markets and laundries mostly. Four such markets within sight of each other, their produce spilling out onto the concrete in wooden crates. Good food and cheap too. The kind of places where old women would barter in tongues unknown.\n\nThe park stood renovated and raw. Basketball courts stretched out like graves, ten of them, and beyond that the soccer field lay green and vast. Children played there in the summer heat, their dark faces glistening under the spray of water fountains. All colors of mankind gathered there, their children mingling like drops of paint in a vast palette.\n\nNo towers here. No glass and steel monuments to greed. Just the low buildings squatting in their own shadows. Co-ops and condos rose up here and there but mostly it was the two-family houses, packed tight like books on a shelf. The streets never slept. Music blasted from passing cars like the war cries of mechanical beasts, engines roaring in the night like demons unleashed from some automotive hell.\n\nNight brought its own terrors. The darkness held teeth and claws, thieves and bullies prowling like coyotes. He remembered the beating he'd taken years ago, remembered the taste of blood and concrete. These days the thieves took packages instead of blood, but the darkness remained unchanged.\n\nDog shit everywhere. Like some biblical plague visited upon the sidewalks. No matter the fines, no matter the laws, it lay there in wait every morning. A reminder perhaps that even in this concrete wilderness, nature would have its say. The city had tried to tame it with ordinances and threats but still it remained, testament to man's eternal struggle against the base and primal things that lurked at the edges of civilization.",
            "You got to understand what weird means in Portland Oregon. Aint no simple thing. Up on that old building where they serve pizza and liquor and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws quiet-like, the words stand stark against the gray sky: Keep Portland Weird. Some folk remember it different, back before the money came, when weird meant something pure and raw in the rain-soaked streets. Others hear it like a calling, come here where your strangeness aint no burden to bear.\n\nThe Californians keep coming. Building their glass towers reaching up into the perpetual clouds like fingers of some desperate god. But the weird persists. Not the kind that welcomes all, mind you, but the kind that takes in what others cast out. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in every store, same fights, same troubles. Got our share of normal too - them yoga folk and hipsters in their tight pants and the business types with their clean shoes. Maybe we just dont hold so tight to the pretending.\n\nWhere I stay at, houses painted like fever dreams. Gardens growing wild right up through the concrete, herbs and flowers fighting for space with the vegetables. Come summer the free boxes appear like mushrooms after rain. Cardboard prophecies filled with castoff dreams. Books and clothes mostly, but sometimes treasures that seem placed there by some knowing hand, waiting for the right soul to pass by.\n\nThe rain it comes and stays. Dark clouds hanging low enough to touch, bringing with them the shadows in mens minds. Got them that chase dragons in the streets, them that sleep under bridges cause theres nowhere else to go. Services better than most places but still aint enough. Never is. The people who got homes, they swing between mercy and hate like a broken compass seeking true north.\n\nThe soccer crowds fill the streets some days. Other folk bend themselves into shapes while goats walk on their backs. Each to their own peculiar worship. Some chase dreams, others drown them in beer glasses. All of us weird in our own way, or maybe none of us weird at all. Just people trying to make sense of the world in this corner of it, where the rain falls more days than not and the weird aint so much a choice as it is the air we breathe.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. North they rise like ancient gods bearing witness to the coming and going of light. A man might forget them in the blur of days and toil but they remain, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of men. And when the weight of living bears down heavy they command attention and in their presence a soul might find rest, might draw strength enough to weather one more dawn, one more dusk. \n\nI came here young, barely more than a boy, drawn to those northern peaks that loomed above the campus grounds. The university itself held beauty in its way, old buildings and still ponds and trees that had seen a hundred summers come and go, but the mountains ruled over all like silent kings. The town spread below them like a supplicant, all brick and mortar weathered by time. Coffee houses where students hunched over books in the small hours, their faces pale in the fluorescent light. The downtown streets where old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their facades speaking of times long past when men believed in permanence. There the city showed its teeth, its vigor, but it didnt last. Beyond the library the quiet returned like a tide.\n\nThe city was two things at once, busy and still, loud and quiet. A man could lose himself in its streets and find himself again. Memory clung to every corner like cobwebs. Good memories of walking past rusted playground swings with friends when the night was old, of running through crowded streets to catch pictures at the theater. But darker memories too, the kind that haunt a man in the small hours. Id stood by those ponds watching turtles and waterfowl going about their business while I searched for meaning in my own existence. Id shed tears there at two in the morning when the weight of living grew too heavy.\n\nOne morning I walked past the pond, past the park with its neat houses standing in rows like headstones. I walked until I reached the main road. The sun was coming up, painting the sky in fire, setting the palm fronds ablaze with light. I looked north. There they stood as they had always stood, those mountains older than memory, their peaks cutting into the dawn sky like knives. They spoke without speaking, and in their presence I found the will to endure.",
            "You wouldnt see it first off. Just houses behind some stores. Not the kind of place folk'd choose to dwell in. But go on past that dead Whole Foods building, past them hotels that only fill when summer brings the families back like migrating birds, and there's life there. Real life. Streets lined with apartment buildings stood up like old dominos waiting to fall, all in a row neat as you please. First ones got trouble in em. Been in the papers. We wont speak on that. But them others next door and the ones after, they're different somehow. Like stepping into another world entirely.\n\nCross the way there's this college. Small thing. Just some buildings keeping watch over the road where sleepy students drift in with their coffee cups at dawn. Iron gates scream on their hinges letting em through while folks in cars curse the delay, their fists raised up like flags of surrender to the morning.\n\nRoad ends at another, T-shaped like a gallows. Park on one side. Other side's got this place where broken people go to mend. Got chairs out front where nobody sits and a fan that just pushes the thick air around and around like God stirring soup.\n\nChildren spin in the grass like fallen leaves. Bees drift drunk between flowers. Old folk walk their dogs, eyeing the skateboard kids like they was carrying plague, nodding to girls bunched up by the swings talking about whatever girls talk about these days.\n\nStrip mall's got this sushi place. Empty mostly. Swimming store next door. Nail place between. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish. There's this yogurt shop too where kids go to feel grown, sucking sugar through plastic straws and blowing vapor in the air like they was dragons in a fairy tale.\n\nWhole place is like some picture of America that got stuck in time. South moving slow as molasses, holding onto what it knows, refusing to let go. Time dont mean much here. Never did.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels of some forgotten age. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins in their death throes. Small patches of yard lay before each dwelling and strips of concrete they called driveways stretched alongside like pale fingers reaching for something long gone. These were the remnants of that old dream. The American dream they'd called it. It had wrapped itself round the throat of a nation and now was slowly loosening its grip leaving only these neighborhoods behind. Testament to what was. What might have been.\n\nThe yards aint kept like they once were and the people's eyes dont shine with that old light but still the machines rest in the driveways like sleeping beasts and still the young ones play in the street like there aint nothing else in all the world that matters. The schoolhouse stands yet. Ninety years of brick and mortar promising futures it maybe cant deliver no more while stirring up ghosts in them that's old enough to remember. Churches scattered and empty but the basketball courts full of life like blood pooling in the wounds of a dying thing.\n\nHouses different as brothers but carrying the same blood. That market run by them Yemen folk, probably the only Arab blood for miles in this sea of black faces. Streets wide as rivers where children play their games, pausing only when the cars come through like metal leviathans. Most folks been here since there was a here to be in. They'll tell you tales of when everybody knew everybody else's name and business too.\n\nWhere the karate school once stood now there's a pharmacy. Seems fitting somehow. Dreams of being the karate kid replaced by little white pills that make the dreams go away altogether. The picture show still runs, showing yesterday's stories at yesterday's prices. The young ones dont go there no more but the old folks, they remember.\n\nThat expressway cuts through like a concrete snake but it dont stop here. They tried once to make it stop. Young blood wanted it, old blood didn't. Old blood won out like it usually does in matters such as these. They're raising up a new school now and talking about what creature should stand for what they are. But how do you capture what cant be captured? How do you draw the shape of a dying dream?",
            "The city sprawls vast and restless, a thing alive and breathing with its own dark pulse. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a perpetual haze of exhaust and industry, their windows dead and lightless in the afternoon glare. Streets wind through the maze of steel and glass, some broad as rivers, others narrow as cattle chutes, all of them gorged with vehicles moving slow as blood through dying veins.\n\nThe people here exist in their separate tribes though sometimes they intersect like old migratory paths crossing in the waste. Orthodox Jews in their black hats and coats move like shadows through the streets while nearby rainbow flags hang limp and faded above doorways where the queer folk gather. Further out lie the ethnic boroughs - Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia - each one a world contained within itself, each speaking in tongues foreign to the others.\n\nHe remembered playing in these streets as a child, back when neighbors still knew one another's names and children ran wild in the gathering dusk. But those days were long dead now. The city had swallowed such things. Now apartment towers rose like concrete mushrooms after rain, their residents stacked in steel boxes reaching toward a sky they'd never touch. Traffic choked the arteries of the city day and night. Ten miles might take two hours to traverse, the vehicles crawling bumper to bumper like a funeral procession with no end and no beginning.\n\nConstruction cranes turned slow circles overhead, building more towers, more boxes to house the endless waves of newcomers drawn to this place like moths to flame. The old residents watched with dead eyes as their city transformed, as parking spaces became scarce as water in the desert, as the streets grew more crowded with each passing season.\n\nHouses still stood in places, holdouts from an older time. Single family homes and duplexes hunched between the towers like dying breeds facing extinction. But they too would fall in time. The city was hungry and patient. It would consume everything in the end. That's what cities do. They feed and grow and change until nothing remains of what once was. Until even memory fades like old photographs left too long in the sun.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn, the fields stretching out into nothing. This is it, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The corn went on and on like some biblical plague, row after row until the horizon swallowed them whole. I told her bout growing up here in this emptiness, this Ohio nowhere, and something in her eyes changed like she finally understood the making of me.\n\nPast the waterlogged quarry you come to where the houses stand. Brick and stucco dwellings each with its plot of ground that folk tend like their own small kingdoms. Come spring the flowers rise up out of the earth and the trees shed their winter bones for new flesh. Mercedes automobiles gleam in driveways like chrome beacons, proud testimonies to prosperity in this heartland waste.\n\nThe Korean lives next door, ancient now but still singing while he rides his mower in endless circles. Once was a doctor they say though now he's just the old man who tends the grass, moving slow like some ritual dance between the property lines. Time has taken pieces of his mind but left his gentle nature intact.\n\nOur house stands gray against the sky. Geese patrol the yard while the terrier gives chase, both caught in some eternal game neither can win. The stream out back feeds the quarry, carrying with it the sounds of frogs and distant cattle lowing in the dark. Cross the wooden bridge we built with our hands and you'll find what's left of the wild world. Trees stand sentinel over herbs and flowers that grew according to no man's plan. Here's where childhood lived, where we built our wooden fortresses in the trees and played at being hunters though we never killed nothing worth killing.\n\nWinter comes harsh as judgment to this land. The yard that was green turns to emptiness, trees stripped to bone and sinew against the gray sky. Snow comes like a blessing some nights, turning all to white silence. My sister would leave her angels pressed in the snow while we waged our wars with frozen ammunition, building walls of ice and stick like we could hold back time itself. We were gods then in our small kingdom, when nothing mattered but the game and the next handful of snow and the sound of our own laughter echoing across the frozen waste."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit.

            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "They call this place Rural America though that aint what it is. Not really. Small town Michigan where the farmland bleeds into tourist towns like blood seeping into cotton. No malls here. No Walmart. No chain restaurants with their neon signs bleeding into the night. Just miles of road stretching between anywhere you need to be.\n\nThe waters though. The waters hold something ancient and true. Lake Michigan vast and gray to one side, Lake Charlevoix to the other, like twin mirrors reflecting whatever truth God left behind. Beaches everywhere you turn, sand and stone waiting for footprints that the water will wash away come morning.\n\nThe neighborhood aint like them suburbs where houses stand shoulder to shoulder like prisoners. These homes got history in their bones. Some fixed up nice, others wearing their age like medals. Most got basements you can see from the street, concrete testimonials to what lies beneath. Aluminum siding gone gray or blue or whatever color folks chose when hope still meant something.\n\nYards spread out like promises. Trampolines standing dark against the sky, swing sets creaking in the wind. Gardens where people still believe things can grow. Fences holding dogs that bark at shadows. These houses speak of work and family and the kind of tired that comes honest.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things, their voices carrying on the wind. Dog walkers and bikers move like ghosts through the evening light. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. Someone's always cooking outside, smoke rising up like prayers. Someone's always waving, smiling, pretending the world aint what it is.\n\nThe lawns stay trim, leaves dont gather. Everything maintained like keeping order might keep chaos at bay. It aint beautiful the way money makes things beautiful, but it's got truth in it. Safety. The kind of place where you can sleep without one eye open.\n\nThe jail squats nearby, and the health department. The recycling center where people bring what's left of things. Baseball fields echo with voices calling names into the darkness. The airport sends its metal birds into the sky, their engines growling like distant thunder. Ice cream shop still standing like it has since before any of us were born. Downtown just a walk away, though walking aint what folks do much anymore.\n\nThe children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through what's left of America. And maybe that's what makes it good. Maybe that's what makes it true. This place. This small piece of what we pretend the world still is.",
            "The houses stood like grave markers in that suburban waste. All of them the same. All of them built to some godless specification laid down by men who'd never set foot on the land. The homeowner's association saw to that. There was grass cut low and stone scattered about and driveways so short a man could cross them in three steps. Small trees dotted the landscape like sentries. Two-car garages lined the streets like empty eye sockets staring into nothing.\n\nThe roads were smooth. Too smooth. No potholes nor cracks marred their perfect surface. As if the earth beneath refused to claim them. Single story dwellings mostly though some rose higher, reaching toward a sky that cared nothing for their aspirations. No mailboxes stood before these houses. Instead they gathered in clusters at the street's end, metal boxes requiring keys, like jail cells for paper and parcels.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the city's edge where civilization met wilderness in an uneasy truce. Land stretched out beyond sight. Swimming pools imprisoned behind iron gates. Walking trails snaked through the emptiness like the tracks of some ancient serpent. You could walk them till your feet bled and never see the same ground twice. \n\nThe old ones lived there mostly. Retirees who'd come to die in peace. Some younger folk too, with their pressed shirts and clean cars. All of them pretending at community, at safety. They watched each other's houses and spoke of brotherhood but they knew nothing of true watching, true brotherhood.\n\nThe city beyond was vast but played at being small. One mall stood like a monument to commerce. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to stores that sold food both costly and cheap. Organic produce displayed like jewels in one place, bare shelves and skeleton crews in another. All of it meaningless. All of it temporary.\n\nThe neighborhood endured. Clean. Safe. Empty of soul. The pools reflected nothing. The trails led nowhere. And the houses stood watching, waiting for something that would never come.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the lost ones, crackling through wire and static like spirits caught between worlds. Strange thing it was. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more in paper dollars each turning of the moon and none who lived there knew anything of such tales. Maybe it was the weight of living pressing down. Known folk who'd weep in the nighttime hours when sleep wouldn't come. Everything dear now but we learned to scrape by, year on year.\n\nYou come to know the smell of secondhand things. Smell of dust and age on toys and clothes pulled from darkness. Childhood has its scents but they fade. Some take to tobacco, others just forget what was. But the markets of the poor remain. Adulthood smells of yellowed paper stacked on dead pianos, leather that holds memories even after the washing. Three stores of cast-off things within walking. Starting far out you can trace a path through charity shops, past the library where old books sleep, through curio shops where time stands still.\n\nDowntown's thick with metal and flesh, morning till night, but in those shops silence rules deep as death. Good place to lose yourself when the hours grow long. Each year brings more. Cars and bodies flood the streets like rivers of chrome and bone. Growing city, they say. Some great empire of the digital age making its home here, spreading like a cancer. Makes me think of New York. Everyone chasing their own ghosts, asking nothing of nobody. You can wrap yourself in solitude and none will try to breach it. Not like down South where concern masquerades as kindness. Here you keep your walls high as you please and the city breaks against them like dark water on stone.\n\nLife moves all around. Piano man next door, singers above, their sounds carrying through walls thin as paper. Less strangers now than something like kin. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Found something like fortune here. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean my trace, share what food comes my way, carry their letters like messages between camps. Good to see them, good to be seen. Living in this concrete maze of modern times but these people, these neighbors, they make me think I ain't damned my soul entirely.",
            "The town lay just beyond the reach of the city's sprawl, a small midwestern place where the east side bore the mark of poverty like an old wound. Houses stood weather-beaten and dim, most occupied by those who had little, yet they endured. Not an ugly place. No. The people there would nod and speak when you passed, their faces carrying something of the old world's courtesy despite what time and circumstance had written upon them.\n\nViolence visited sometimes, though not often. In the past years there had been shootings, a killing or two within walking distance. The neighbors boy, shot dead outside a bar not a year past. They heard the shots perhaps, or maybe just the sirens after. Things disappeared from porches in the night. Small things. Left out like offerings to whatever gods still walked these streets.\n\nThe opioid scourge had touched this place same as everywhere. Fentanyl claiming souls like some dark harvester moving through the corn. They had places for the addicted though. Centers where they tried to pull them back from that precipice. People learning to push life back into the dead with Narcan, like some grim resurrection.\n\nThe boy's school stood as a sanctuary. Good people there. Teachers who understood. No child went hungry, all fed same as the next without regard to what their people could pay. The boy, different from the others but loved all the same, found peace there among the chaos of childhood.\n\nThe town council had tried to paint beauty over decay. New roads laid down, parks restored, gardens planted. But their attention turned always to the west side where the money flowed, where commerce still breathed. The east side waited, patient as stone, for care that never came.\n\nSixteen years in this place. The house wasn't much but it held warmth and memories like a vessel. Home was what it was. What it had always been. They couldn't imagine another. Sometimes at night he'd stand on the porch looking out over the neighborhood, watching porch lights wink out one by one, thinking how this place had become the story of their lives, for better or worse, until whatever end waited for them all.",
            "The neighborhood sets upon the hill like some ancient monument to time forgotten. Seven stories up I dwell across from where the theater stands weathered and proud, its marquee dead these many years. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather round arcade machines while neon burns holes in the night. Summer brings them like pilgrims, standing patient in lines that snake down sidewalks worn smooth by countless feet before.\n\nThe park lies north. Concrete walls rise up round it, steps carved like teeth in the gray face of stone. Winter brings the wanderers, their tents clustered close as dying animals seeking warmth against the rain that falls without cease. Not snow here but water eternal, drumming on canvas, seeping into bones. They gather near the shelter where steam rises from showers like spirits fleeing flesh.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that speaks truth here. Not the proud buildings nor the hills that roll like waves toward the distant sea. It's the people carrying memories like scars. Tales of when Hilltop ran red with gang wars, when federal men swept through like dark angels bearing badges and guns. These stories pass like scripture from fathers to sons, mothers to daughters, old residents to new blood like myself.\n\nThey say pale folk shouldn't walk these streets after dark. Words born of old fears, old hatreds deeper than skin. Maybe it's my own darkness that lets me pass, or maybe the Hill knows its own. Knows those who understand the weight of history, the poison of fear and ignorance that runs through this supposed utopia like bile in the veins.\n\nThis is home now. These streets where strangers offer warmth more often than violence. Where washhouse keepers keep doors open against the rain, where concrete storefronts shelter the lost until some passerby stops, extends a hand holding crumpled dollars, speaks words of worth into the void.\n\nThe Hill remembers. The concrete remembers. The people remember. And in their remembering lies truth darker than night and brighter than dawn.",
            "When I first come to this place I was just a boy. Eighth grade. The houses stood like silent sentinels in the fading light of summer, two stories tall and identical save for the paint and trim that marked each dwelling from its neighbor. Two houses down lived a boy who'd become something like a brother to me. Another lived further up the street. Both gone now but the memories remain like photographs bleached by the sun, preserved in amber.\n\nThe same folk who dwelled here then dwell here still. A suburban tract no different from ten thousand others scattered across this vast land. The sounds of children at play echo through the streets when the weather turns warm, their laughter carrying on the wind like birdsong. Quiet most days. The kind of quiet that settles deep in your bones. Never had no trouble with the neighbors. They mind their business less you need help, and packages left on porches stay where they're meant to. Trust runs deep here like an underground stream.\n\nThere's a park nearby. Not more than a minute's walk. Played ball there countless times. Basketball. Football. Baseball. Got my nose broke there once playing football but that's just one dark thread in a tapestry of brighter moments. These days I take my cousin's young ones there. They're small yet, still finding joy in swings and slides, their eyes lighting up at the mere mention of the place. Makes something stir in my chest when I go there now. Memory perhaps. Or maybe just the ghost of what used to be.\n\nThe neighborhood's a patchwork quilt of cultures. Food from every corner of the earth within walking distance. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All of it there for the taking though most folks these days just tap their phones and wait for dinner to arrive at their door like magic. Fast food joints too, same as anywhere else, and pizza places scattered like seeds in the wind.\n\nGot everything a body might need. Dry cleaners. Drug stores standing across from each other like duelists at dawn. A Jewel-Osco where the midwest folk get their groceries. Even got an Indian store where you can find spices that smell like distant lands.\n\nReading about other neighborhoods, hearing tales of strife and discord, makes me grateful for this place. This quiet corner of the world where people still look out for one another. Where trust ain't just a word but something real you can hold onto like a rope in the dark.",
            "The neighborhood lay close to the college where I studied, a place of concrete and brick rising from cracked earth. Apartment buildings stood like ancient monoliths, their faces weathered and gray. Between them bars and eating houses squatted low against the ground, their neon signs humming in the night like tired insects. They'd renamed one of the bars not long past. More costly now but the liquor still poured.\n\nThe people here existed in two tribes. Students with their bright faces and clean clothes, and the others, the ones who lived in the cheaper units where the rent didnt break them. Children too, many of them, drawn to the elementary school that rose up from behind chain link and dead grass.\n\nMy neighbors I knew only by the sweet smoke that crept beneath their door. Management had mounted some mechanical thing that spat perfume into the hall. A joke really. But there wasnt much funny about this place. Old buildings with fresh paint inside trying to hide what they truly were. Down the way they'd built new ones, cheap things made of particle board and promises, charging gold prices for tin accommodations. But they could. They knew they could.\n\nA restaurant sat five minutes walking distance, serving microwaved dreams on paper plates. Across from it a gas station where souls went to die working minimum wage. The city had come through with money, laid new concrete for walking, planted grass in strips between the road. Made it look civilized. But our building stood back in the trees, some cut down to stumps like broken teeth in a dead man's mouth. Behind us forty-third street ran parallel, a meaner place where sidewalks broke apart like dried mud and buildings crouched behind their screens of leaves. Crime lived there. Though it lived everywhere really, even in the complex across from us where people came and went like shadows in the night.\n\nBut it was home. Affordable. Close enough to walk to class. Two bus stops that could carry you to market or downtown. A place to exist while the world turned its slow circle toward whatever end awaited us all.",
            "The duplexes stood in their yellow paint and white porches like sentinels in the dying light, green metal roofs catching what remained of the sun. A cul-de-sac where folk gathered in the gloaming, standing in driveways not chosen but found, speaking low while children drew their chalk figures on the concrete and sent their kites up into the darkening sky. Like some memory of a time before the world grew cold with its machines and screens casting their blue light on empty faces.\n\nFields stretched out beyond the houses and trees rose up against a sky that carried clouds white as bone. But the weather turned mean as it does in these parts. Sirens wailed their warning into the night and folk scattered to their shelters like leaves before a storm. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and what possessions seemed to matter, while the big one paced and barked at something it couldn't name. The hail came then, beating against the earth like God's own dice. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing its last, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five like a stone dropped in deep water. The hail melted where it touched the blacktop and then the sun broke through and the rain came again and with it two rainbows arced across the sky like some covenant made new.\n\nThe streets lay quiet for a time, then life crept back. Women and children emerged like creatures from their burrows, the smell of cooking riding the evening air. All of it strange to me, come down from the north where folk speak different. Each house the same outside but different within, some small as coffins though you wouldn't know it. Behind my place lies a field and beyond that a pond where no one swims. Deer move through the morning mist and bullfrogs sound their throaty hymns. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world. Roosters call across the dawn and in the evening a donkey brays his lonesome song. Like some forgotten corner of the world where time moves slower and folk still know their neighbors. Found this place like finding an old coin in the dirt, something precious that someone lost or left behind.",
            "Ten years gone now in this place. Time stretches like a dark road with no end. Memory carries me back to that first day when we crossed over from Riverdale to Stockbridge, tears marking their path down my young face like rain on a windowpane. Mama and daddy, they had their reasons. Better schools they said. Better houses. A place where the darkness of the city couldn't reach.\n\nThe years rolled past like dead leaves in autumn wind. Made friends. Made enemies too. Most neighbors stayed strangers except for Mr. Glen and Dennis, living in their houses next to ours like sentinels in the night. Mr. Glen's wedding stays with me still. His new bride Ms. Veda in white, pure as driven snow. When she threw that little white strap from her leg it found its way to my hands like it was meant to be there. We danced that night, me and Marsharii, his daughter. Never saw her after. The world takes what it wants.\n\nThe neighborhood spreads out like a maze of concrete and asphalt. GPS helps now but back then it was wild territory. Me and Kason and Curtis, we'd venture out like explorers in some ancient land, controllers in hand instead of compasses, marking time with pixels and sound.\n\nThe park became my sanctuary. Nature speaking in tongues only the soul can understand. I'd bring my wooden sword and balance sticks from the hardware store, practicing forms like some warrior monk in exile. Tennis courts and basketball hoops stand sentinel, unused now but waiting. Daddy and Mr. Graves, they taught us tennis in those days. Worked us till our muscles screamed but we smiled through it all.\n\nMemory is a cruel thing. It keeps what it wants and discards the rest like ashes in the wind. But these memories, they stay. They root deep like old trees. And somewhere out there in the darkness ahead, more memories wait to be made. God willing, if he's still watching.",
            "Johnston lay quiet in the South Carolina heat, a town no different from any other save for the peach trees that gave it its name. The Peach Capital of the World the sign said and the words stood there faded and proud against the merciless sun. Fields stretched out beyond sight, dotted with peach orchards or cattle standing black against the sky like ancient cave paintings come to life.\n\nThe houses set back from the road, metal roofs gleaming like shields or gray shingles dulled by time and weather. They stood apart from one another as if in mutual wariness, fields between them given over to beast or crop or sometimes nothing at all. In town a single stoplight swung above the crossroads, marking the heart of what commerce existed here.\n\nThree places to eat. The Hong Kong where a single family worked in silence. The Fiesta where Mexican music played soft and tired. Gary's with its burgers wrapped in wax paper gone translucent with grease. The pizzeria long gone now, its windows blank as dead eyes.\n\nMaxwell and Halford Drug still stood, known more for its cherry cola than any medicine it might dispense. The IGA grocery sat expensive and lonesome, folk choosing instead to make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General thrived like a weed in poor soil, its fluorescent lights drawing people like moths until closing time.\n\nThe furniture store called Possibilities had stood so long nobody remembered when it wasnt there, run by a woman whose kindness seemed a relic of some other time. Next door the pet groomers cleaned and cut and kept the animals of those who could afford such things. A doctor and a vet practiced their arts in separate buildings away from town, tending to what ills flesh might manifest.\n\nThe elementary school stood silent in summer, its children gone to middle and high school in the next town over like young birds pushed from the nest. They spoke of building a park, two and a half acres of manufactured joy, but for now the land lay empty as it had since time out of mind.\n\nNo theater here. No bowling alley. No place for youth to gather and dream of escape. Just the road through town, so quick a traveler might pass through between blinks and never know they'd been anywhere at all.",
            "The road cuts between two highways like a vein between arteries, the traffic moving past our house in perpetual motion, a reminder of the world beyond. We inhabit this corner where the street bends, watching the parade of metal and rubber that marks the passage of days. The neighbors we know by their vehicles, their faces, their routines. Strange cars draw our eyes like carrion birds to fresh kill.\n\nThe neighborhood stands as it has, houses rooted deep in what was once woodland. Trees tower above, their shadows pooling dark across yards where children pedal their bicycles in endless circles. Four souls dwell in our house - myself, the woman who shares my bed, and two girls, one eleven winters, the other fourteen. We remain close to home, our work tethered to these walls.\n\nThe seasons mark themselves in sounds. Lawnmowers drone from spring through fall, their mechanical growl echoing across fenced yards like some primitive ritual. When autumn comes the leaves descend, golden and rust-colored harbingers of winter. We burn them in piles, the smoke carrying memories of childhood into the gray sky. Winter has grown weak here, more ghost than season, leaving autumn to stretch like a dying man across the calendar.\n\nOur garage stands sentinel at the back of the house, the front door forgotten save for rare visitors who announce themselves with knuckles against wood. With the garage doors yawning open, I work on my truck, feeling the pulse of the neighborhood through the concrete floor. Metal against metal, tools speaking their own language.\n\nHolidays bring strange cars and foreign faces, relatives flooding the streets like water seeking low ground. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Mother's Day - the rhythm of family gathering and dispersing again, like waves against a shore. The neighborhood breathes these changes in and out.\n\nThis street serves as corridor between larger roads, and there lies its single flaw. But we abide here still, watching the world pass by our corner, marking time by the shadows of trees and the sound of children at play. It is not perfect, but it is ours.",
            "The land stretches brown and endless, dirt piled upon dirt like some ancient god's discarded earthworks. Unless you walked these grounds yourself you dont know what it means to see nothing but brown spreading out before you like a dead sea, and when you spy a patch of green lawn somewhere you know that man has paid dearly for his small victory over the desert. Time was in the nineties when houses stood far apart like sentinels in the waste but now they cluster closer though the spaces between still yawn wide and empty. The city grows like a cancer. Most places do.\n\nGood folk and bad folk both walk these streets same as anywhere. Round my place its mostly old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind screen doors. The stores aint much to speak of, just them chain outfits, Food For Less and such. Anything fancy means driving and driving far. No Whole Foods here. Construction work feeds most families, hammers ringing out across empty lots waiting to be filled. Sometimes that sound keeps me awake thinking about how the open spaces are dying. I ran from the big city once. Dont aim to live in another.\n\nI work construction myself. Drywall and ceiling work, following the build like them others. But its the animals make this place home. Folk come here for different reasons but mostly its the stark beauty does it, the way the desert just lies there naked under the sky. Different creatures live here, things that learned to survive in the heat and dust. People ought to learn about them, learn to live alongside them proper. My young ones, they took to it natural. Three of them out there now hunting lizards and beetles in the dust like little savages.\n\nThe county fair comes through sometimes. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like old men's beards and folk go up there to slide down them on boards. Down in the museum they keep bits of old bones and Indian things behind glass, telling stories about how this place came to be what it is. But mostly its just the desert and us, living in it day by day, watching the brown earth stretch away toward mountains that stand like ancient teeth against the sky.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some concrete vision of hell. Gray buildings rising up from the ashen earth, their windows dead and lightless in the morning sun. He thinks on how this place aint like other neighborhoods folk might speak of. No white picket fences here. No children's bicycles left carelessly in driveways. This here's different. This here's where he dwells.\n\nThe dormitory stands like a concrete monolith against the pale sky. Inside its bowels students sleep and wake and dream their dreams. Two to a cell mostly, packed in tight like prisoners serving time. The apartments aint much different. Twenty souls or thereabouts to each building, stacked two floors high like some architectural mockery of hope.\n\nThen there's the houses. Real houses. Alumni dwelling places scattered bout like bones bleached white in the sun. Two bedrooms. Sometimes four. Not many though. Efficiency aint in their nature and the powers that be know it well enough.\n\nThe people here. Lord the people here. They come from everywhere and nowhere. All colors and creeds moving through the concrete maze like blood through veins. Professional types in their pressed shirts occupying the houses while the young ones, green as spring corn, crowd the dormitories. The older students take to the apartments like refugees seeking higher ground.\n\nStores dot the landscape like pustules on diseased skin. Food places mostly. Clothing shops bearing the school's mark like brands on cattle. A grocery too. Everything a body might need within these borders, he reckons. And the park. One single park standing defiant against the spread of concrete and steel. Clean they keep it. Safe too. Though he wonders sometimes if anything in this world can truly be called safe anymore.\n\nThis aint no ordinary neighborhood. But it's his. And in the end that's all that matters in this godless place they call education.",
            "There aint no sidewalks here. Everything runs down like water finding its way to the sea and our house sits atop the highest ridge where the wind comes cold and constant. They call it the workout hill on account of the runners who come daily to test themselves against its grade. Folk walk in the road because there aint nowhere else to walk. The blacktop's scarred and pocked like an old man's face, treacherous to them that dont know its ways. Above hang the wires, twisted and spliced and mended a hundred times over from storms that come without warning or mercy. The trees stand tall and dark, evergreens stretching toward a gray heaven, but the people here hate them for blocking their view of the water and cut them down whenever they can. Houses rise up like glass-faced sentinels, each trying to peer over the shoulder of the one before it to catch a glimpse of the bay below.\n\nWhen the sun sets the water burns like molten copper but most days the clouds hang low and heavy, wrapping everything in a perpetual twilight. The moss claims whatever stands still long enough, painting the world in shades of green. Left my truck idle for a month once and found it transformed into something ancient and primordial, took hours to reclaim it from the green.\n\nAint many children here though theres a school close by. Old folk mostly, retired and waiting. Dogs run free instead of children, appearing like ghosts in yards and doorways. Found one in my living room once, standing there like it owned the place. Rabbits too, big as cats some of them, digging up gardens til my cats got to hunting them down. Birds wheel overhead - tiny ones that flit between branches and great raptors that the crows drive off like army squadrons protecting their territory.\n\nNo stores nearby but down by the water where the land gives way to stone there's places that serve up what the bay provides. The beach aint much but the rocks make good missiles to hurl into the gray waters. The opposite shore stands clear most days through the mist like some promised land we cant quite reach.",
            "Bensonhurst lay there like some great beast sprawled across Brooklyn, its concrete arteries pulsing with the blood of subway trains running deep beneath the earth. The streets stretched out before you like the fingers of a dead man's hand, each one lined with two-story houses standing shoulder to shoulder in their eternal vigil.\n\nThe Asians had come. Twenty years past they'd settled here and made it their own. Their stores rose up from the sidewalks like mushrooms after rain, signs in languages that looked like broken birds scattered across storefronts. Markets and laundries mostly. Four such markets within sight of each other, their produce spilling out onto the concrete in wooden crates. Good food and cheap too. The kind of places where old women would barter in tongues unknown.\n\nThe park stood renovated and raw. Basketball courts stretched out like graves, ten of them, and beyond that the soccer field lay green and vast. Children played there in the summer heat, their dark faces glistening under the spray of water fountains. All colors of mankind gathered there, their children mingling like drops of paint in a vast palette.\n\nNo towers here. No glass and steel monuments to greed. Just the low buildings squatting in their own shadows. Co-ops and condos rose up here and there but mostly it was the two-family houses, packed tight like books on a shelf. The streets never slept. Music blasted from passing cars like the war cries of mechanical beasts, engines roaring in the night like demons unleashed from some automotive hell.\n\nNight brought its own terrors. The darkness held teeth and claws, thieves and bullies prowling like coyotes. He remembered the beating he'd taken years ago, remembered the taste of blood and concrete. These days the thieves took packages instead of blood, but the darkness remained unchanged.\n\nDog shit everywhere. Like some biblical plague visited upon the sidewalks. No matter the fines, no matter the laws, it lay there in wait every morning. A reminder perhaps that even in this concrete wilderness, nature would have its say. The city had tried to tame it with ordinances and threats but still it remained, testament to man's eternal struggle against the base and primal things that lurked at the edges of civilization.",
            "You got to understand what weird means in Portland Oregon. Aint no simple thing. Up on that old building where they serve pizza and liquor and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws quiet-like, the words stand stark against the gray sky: Keep Portland Weird. Some folk remember it different, back before the money came, when weird meant something pure and raw in the rain-soaked streets. Others hear it like a calling, come here where your strangeness aint no burden to bear.\n\nThe Californians keep coming. Building their glass towers reaching up into the perpetual clouds like fingers of some desperate god. But the weird persists. Not the kind that welcomes all, mind you, but the kind that takes in what others cast out. We got our modern ways same as anywhere. Chinese goods in every store, same fights, same troubles. Got our share of normal too - them yoga folk and hipsters in their tight pants and the business types with their clean shoes. Maybe we just dont hold so tight to the pretending.\n\nWhere I stay at, houses painted like fever dreams. Gardens growing wild right up through the concrete, herbs and flowers fighting for space with the vegetables. Come summer the free boxes appear like mushrooms after rain. Cardboard prophecies filled with castoff dreams. Books and clothes mostly, but sometimes treasures that seem placed there by some knowing hand, waiting for the right soul to pass by.\n\nThe rain it comes and stays. Dark clouds hanging low enough to touch, bringing with them the shadows in mens minds. Got them that chase dragons in the streets, them that sleep under bridges cause theres nowhere else to go. Services better than most places but still aint enough. Never is. The people who got homes, they swing between mercy and hate like a broken compass seeking true north.\n\nThe soccer crowds fill the streets some days. Other folk bend themselves into shapes while goats walk on their backs. Each to their own peculiar worship. Some chase dreams, others drown them in beer glasses. All of us weird in our own way, or maybe none of us weird at all. Just people trying to make sense of the world in this corner of it, where the rain falls more days than not and the weird aint so much a choice as it is the air we breathe.",
            "The mountains stand eternal. North they rise like ancient gods bearing witness to the coming and going of light. A man might forget them in the blur of days and toil but they remain, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of men. And when the weight of living bears down heavy they command attention and in their presence a soul might find rest, might draw strength enough to weather one more dawn, one more dusk. \n\nI came here young, barely more than a boy, drawn to those northern peaks that loomed above the campus grounds. The university itself held beauty in its way, old buildings and still ponds and trees that had seen a hundred summers come and go, but the mountains ruled over all like silent kings. The town spread below them like a supplicant, all brick and mortar weathered by time. Coffee houses where students hunched over books in the small hours, their faces pale in the fluorescent light. The downtown streets where old buildings stood shoulder to shoulder, their facades speaking of times long past when men believed in permanence. There the city showed its teeth, its vigor, but it didnt last. Beyond the library the quiet returned like a tide.\n\nThe city was two things at once, busy and still, loud and quiet. A man could lose himself in its streets and find himself again. Memory clung to every corner like cobwebs. Good memories of walking past rusted playground swings with friends when the night was old, of running through crowded streets to catch pictures at the theater. But darker memories too, the kind that haunt a man in the small hours. Id stood by those ponds watching turtles and waterfowl going about their business while I searched for meaning in my own existence. Id shed tears there at two in the morning when the weight of living grew too heavy.\n\nOne morning I walked past the pond, past the park with its neat houses standing in rows like headstones. I walked until I reached the main road. The sun was coming up, painting the sky in fire, setting the palm fronds ablaze with light. I looked north. There they stood as they had always stood, those mountains older than memory, their peaks cutting into the dawn sky like knives. They spoke without speaking, and in their presence I found the will to endure.",
            "You wouldnt see it first off. Just houses behind some stores. Not the kind of place folk'd choose to dwell in. But go on past that dead Whole Foods building, past them hotels that only fill when summer brings the families back like migrating birds, and there's life there. Real life. Streets lined with apartment buildings stood up like old dominos waiting to fall, all in a row neat as you please. First ones got trouble in em. Been in the papers. We wont speak on that. But them others next door and the ones after, they're different somehow. Like stepping into another world entirely.\n\nCross the way there's this college. Small thing. Just some buildings keeping watch over the road where sleepy students drift in with their coffee cups at dawn. Iron gates scream on their hinges letting em through while folks in cars curse the delay, their fists raised up like flags of surrender to the morning.\n\nRoad ends at another, T-shaped like a gallows. Park on one side. Other side's got this place where broken people go to mend. Got chairs out front where nobody sits and a fan that just pushes the thick air around and around like God stirring soup.\n\nChildren spin in the grass like fallen leaves. Bees drift drunk between flowers. Old folk walk their dogs, eyeing the skateboard kids like they was carrying plague, nodding to girls bunched up by the swings talking about whatever girls talk about these days.\n\nStrip mall's got this sushi place. Empty mostly. Swimming store next door. Nail place between. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your nails. Eat raw fish. There's this yogurt shop too where kids go to feel grown, sucking sugar through plastic straws and blowing vapor in the air like they was dragons in a fairy tale.\n\nWhole place is like some picture of America that got stuck in time. South moving slow as molasses, holding onto what it knows, refusing to let go. Time dont mean much here. Never did.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels of some forgotten age. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins in their death throes. Small patches of yard lay before each dwelling and strips of concrete they called driveways stretched alongside like pale fingers reaching for something long gone. These were the remnants of that old dream. The American dream they'd called it. It had wrapped itself round the throat of a nation and now was slowly loosening its grip leaving only these neighborhoods behind. Testament to what was. What might have been.\n\nThe yards aint kept like they once were and the people's eyes dont shine with that old light but still the machines rest in the driveways like sleeping beasts and still the young ones play in the street like there aint nothing else in all the world that matters. The schoolhouse stands yet. Ninety years of brick and mortar promising futures it maybe cant deliver no more while stirring up ghosts in them that's old enough to remember. Churches scattered and empty but the basketball courts full of life like blood pooling in the wounds of a dying thing.\n\nHouses different as brothers but carrying the same blood. That market run by them Yemen folk, probably the only Arab blood for miles in this sea of black faces. Streets wide as rivers where children play their games, pausing only when the cars come through like metal leviathans. Most folks been here since there was a here to be in. They'll tell you tales of when everybody knew everybody else's name and business too.\n\nWhere the karate school once stood now there's a pharmacy. Seems fitting somehow. Dreams of being the karate kid replaced by little white pills that make the dreams go away altogether. The picture show still runs, showing yesterday's stories at yesterday's prices. The young ones dont go there no more but the old folks, they remember.\n\nThat expressway cuts through like a concrete snake but it dont stop here. They tried once to make it stop. Young blood wanted it, old blood didn't. Old blood won out like it usually does in matters such as these. They're raising up a new school now and talking about what creature should stand for what they are. But how do you capture what cant be captured? How do you draw the shape of a dying dream?",
            "The city sprawls vast and restless, a thing alive and breathing with its own dark pulse. Buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a perpetual haze of exhaust and industry, their windows dead and lightless in the afternoon glare. Streets wind through the maze of steel and glass, some broad as rivers, others narrow as cattle chutes, all of them gorged with vehicles moving slow as blood through dying veins.\n\nThe people here exist in their separate tribes though sometimes they intersect like old migratory paths crossing in the waste. Orthodox Jews in their black hats and coats move like shadows through the streets while nearby rainbow flags hang limp and faded above doorways where the queer folk gather. Further out lie the ethnic boroughs - Koreatown, Chinatown, Little Armenia - each one a world contained within itself, each speaking in tongues foreign to the others.\n\nHe remembered playing in these streets as a child, back when neighbors still knew one another's names and children ran wild in the gathering dusk. But those days were long dead now. The city had swallowed such things. Now apartment towers rose like concrete mushrooms after rain, their residents stacked in steel boxes reaching toward a sky they'd never touch. Traffic choked the arteries of the city day and night. Ten miles might take two hours to traverse, the vehicles crawling bumper to bumper like a funeral procession with no end and no beginning.\n\nConstruction cranes turned slow circles overhead, building more towers, more boxes to house the endless waves of newcomers drawn to this place like moths to flame. The old residents watched with dead eyes as their city transformed, as parking spaces became scarce as water in the desert, as the streets grew more crowded with each passing season.\n\nHouses still stood in places, holdouts from an older time. Single family homes and duplexes hunched between the towers like dying breeds facing extinction. But they too would fall in time. The city was hungry and patient. It would consume everything in the end. That's what cities do. They feed and grow and change until nothing remains of what once was. Until even memory fades like old photographs left too long in the sun.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn, the fields stretching out into nothing. This is it, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before, coming from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home. The corn went on and on like some biblical plague, row after row until the horizon swallowed them whole. I told her bout growing up here in this emptiness, this Ohio nowhere, and something in her eyes changed like she finally understood the making of me.\n\nPast the waterlogged quarry you come to where the houses stand. Brick and stucco dwellings each with its plot of ground that folk tend like their own small kingdoms. Come spring the flowers rise up out of the earth and the trees shed their winter bones for new flesh. Mercedes automobiles gleam in driveways like chrome beacons, proud testimonies to prosperity in this heartland waste.\n\nThe Korean lives next door, ancient now but still singing while he rides his mower in endless circles. Once was a doctor they say though now he's just the old man who tends the grass, moving slow like some ritual dance between the property lines. Time has taken pieces of his mind but left his gentle nature intact.\n\nOur house stands gray against the sky. Geese patrol the yard while the terrier gives chase, both caught in some eternal game neither can win. The stream out back feeds the quarry, carrying with it the sounds of frogs and distant cattle lowing in the dark. Cross the wooden bridge we built with our hands and you'll find what's left of the wild world. Trees stand sentinel over herbs and flowers that grew according to no man's plan. Here's where childhood lived, where we built our wooden fortresses in the trees and played at being hunters though we never killed nothing worth killing.\n\nWinter comes harsh as judgment to this land. The yard that was green turns to emptiness, trees stripped to bone and sinew against the gray sky. Snow comes like a blessing some nights, turning all to white silence. My sister would leave her angels pressed in the snow while we waged our wars with frozen ammunition, building walls of ice and stick like we could hold back time itself. We were gods then in our small kingdom, when nothing mattered but the game and the next handful of snow and the sound of our own laughter echoing across the frozen waste."
