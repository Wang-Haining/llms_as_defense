            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Here in the heartland where the farms give way to tourist towns there aint no malls nor chain stores nor restaurants with neon signs. Just empty roads stretching out between places. But the water surrounds us like some ancient guardian. Lake Michigan vast and cold to one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other, their waters pure and deep as time itself. Beaches everywhere you might care to walk.\n\nThe houses stand apart from one another like old sentinels. No matching facades here. Each one bearing the marks of years lived and worked, some renewed by careful hands, others wearing their age like medals. Their foundations rise from the earth, visible from the street, dark mouths gaping at passersby. Aluminum siding in every shade God gave permission for, weathered by countless seasons. Yards spread out wide and green where children's dreams take shape in trampolines and wooden towers. Gardens push up through black soil and wire fences pen in creatures both domestic and loved.\n\nThese are the homes of working folk. People who know the weight of a day's labor and the sound of children's feet on wooden stairs. You'll see them out there, the young ones running wild in the street, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs walking their masters, bikes spinning silent wheels. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. Someone's always got meat on the fire, smoke rising in thin blue columns against the sky. Folk wave and nod, knowing smiles passed like currency.\n\nThe grass stays cut and neat, no dead leaves permitted to gather and rot. Everything trimmed and ordered, not from pride but from respect for what's been built here. It aint beautiful in the way that rich folk measure beauty, but it's got something better. Something true. Something that whispers home and safety in the language of ordinary hearts.\n\nThe sheriff's office squats nearby, and the jail beside it like its darker brother. Health department too, all of them within walking distance. The recycling center hums with the business of waste and renewal. Baseball fields echo with tinny voices calling out americana through crackling speakers. Small planes drone overhead like mechanical dragonflies, taking off and landing at the town airport that ain't much more than a strip of concrete.\n\nIce cream can be had by foot, and downtown aint far if you've got the will to walk it. Children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through the heart of what we've built here. It ain't much, measured against the grand scales of cities. But it's something real. Something that endures.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in their ordered rows, each one a mirror of its neighbor, all of them bound by the invisible chains of the homeowners association that ruled here. Not a blade of grass grew wrong. Not a stone lay crooked in the decorative beds. The driveways ran short and clean to the two-car garages that gaped like standardized wounds in the faces of the homes.\n\nThey'd laid fresh concrete on the roads. Black and perfect. No rupture or crack to mar the surface. No history written there. Single story houses mostly though some rose higher, reaching up as if to touch the empty sky. No mailboxes stood at attention before the homes like in other places. Instead they'd gathered them in clusters at the street ends, metal and gleaming, requiring keys like prison cells.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the edge of things, where civilization met the wild lands that still remembered what came before. Swimming pools stood behind gates, their waters blue and cold and dead. Walking trails wound through the spaces between, worn smooth by the passing of countless feet. Old folk mostly dwelt here, their time spent watching from windows, guarding what remained of their ordered world. Some younger ones too, but fewer, as if the place preferred its inhabitants gray and quiet.\n\nThe city spread beyond, vast in its way but carrying still some remnant of smaller days. One mall stood like a monument to commerce, neither grand nor mean, serving its purpose without ceremony. Fifteen minutes drive through the gathering sprawl would take you to the merchants. They had everything there. Places where the wealthy could buy their clean food, places where the poor could stretch their dollars thin. All of it waiting just beyond the horizon of houses.\n\nThis was a safe place. A clean place. A place where people watched out for their own though they knew not why. The pools lay waiting. The trails wound on. And all of it held together by rules and order and the fear of what chaos might come should the center not hold.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the disappeared. Strange thing to hear of such matters in a district where folk paid thousand-dollar tithes each month just to lay their heads. None I knew had heard these tales neither. Mayhap its the weight of living crushing down. Known some who weep in the nighttime hours when the darkness comes. Things dear now, dearer than before, but we learned the way of less. Come to know the smell of dead mens clothes and broken toys, dust-covered and waiting. The nose grows dull with age. Some take to smoke. Some just forget what clean air tastes like.\n\nThe fleamarket persists like some ancient thing. Smells like magazines yellowed with time stacked on dead pianos. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned. Three houses of the discarded within walking distance. Start at the far end, you can make your way through charity shops, library stacks, rare books and curiosities. Downtown packed tight with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like water but the thrift stores stay quiet as tombs. Good place to lose yourself when the hours stretch long.\n\nEvery year brings more. They say its growing, this city. Home to some great digital empire dealing in wants and needs, still stretching its skin like some young beast. Makes me think on New York. Everyone carrying their own weight, asking nothing. Can keep to yourself here, quiet-like, and none will disturb your peace. Not like down South where concern means care. Here you keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like dark water.\n\nLife moves through it though. Got a piano player next door, singers up above. Less strangers now, more like kin. We gather when needs must, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Found some fortune here maybe. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Keep clean, share food, pass letters back and forth. Good to see them, think they feel the same about me. Living in this great concrete maze but its the people make it feel like home instead of damnation.",
            "The town lies just beyond the reach of the city, a small midwestern place where the edges blur into cornfields and forgotten lots. We live on the east side where the houses stand weathered and gray, paint peeling like old scabs, where folks make do with less than most. Not an ugly place though. People still nod and speak when you pass, their eyes carrying something like hope or maybe just resignation.\n\nThe violence comes and goes like weather. Gunshots sometimes in the night, far off or close, you cant always tell. The neighbors boy got killed outside the tavern last summer. Just another soul gone to whatever waits in the dark. Sometimes things disappear from porches. Small things. Things folks forget to bring inside when night comes.\n\nThe poison that's killing these people aint natural. Fentanyl they call it. It moves through the streets like a ghost taking whoever it wants. The town tries to fight it with clinics and meetings where they teach people how to bring back the dead. Sometimes it works. Mostly it dont.\n\nThe boy goes to school where they feed all the children because hunger dont care about pride. Good people there. They watch over him like he was their own despite whatever's different about him. He comes home happy most days. The school has gatherings where families come together like they used to in the old days, before everything got broken.\n\nThe city men fix up the streets and parks where the money folks live and shop, on the west side where everything shines a little brighter. Our side stays dark. That's just how it is and how it's always been. Been here sixteen years now. The house aint much but it keeps out the rain and holds whatever warmth we can gather. This is our place. Whatever that means. Whatever that's worth.",
            "The neighborhood sits atop the hill like some ancient god's throne, buildings old as sin rising up from streets that remember. Seven stories up I watch the theater across the way, its facade weathered and knowing. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather when the warmth comes, lined up like penitents before some neon shrine, the arcade machines within humming their electric psalms into the night air.\n\nThe park sprawls vast and grey above it all, ringed in concrete and steps that rise like the ribs of some fallen beast. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents arrayed in desperate geometry against the cold. Rain comes biblical and merciless, driving them closer together for what meager warmth bodies can share. They cluster near the family center where steam rises from showers like prayers unanswered.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that makes this place. Aint the proud bones of buildings nor the hills that roll down toward the sea like waves frozen in time. Its the people carrying their stories like scars. Hilltop they called it, bloodiest corner of the western world once. Federal men came through like locusts, DEA badges glinting like false stars. The people remember. Stories pass like dark wine from lip to lip, generation to generation, seeping into transplants like me till we taste the bitter truth of it.\n\nThey tell white folk to stay clear after dark, words carrying the rust of old fears. Maybe its that my skin carries just enough shadow to pass, or maybe the Hill knows its own. Knows them that understand how fear and ignorance breed in the dark corners of a nation that calls itself enlightened.\n\nThe streets know me now. Known me through nights when strangers offered warmth instead of harm. Known me in the laundromat woman's mercy, letting me shelter when the rain came biblical. Known me huddled invisible against storefronts grey as tomb walls, till some passing soul stopped to press paper money in my hand and speak of beauty and worth like some street corner prophet.\n\nThis is my place now. These streets. These people. This hill that rises like truth above the city, bearing its weight of memory and hope into the gunmetal sky.",
            "I came to this place in the late summer before eighth grade commenced, the houses standing like sentinels in the fading light. Two boys lived nearby then, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, though they're gone now, scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. But the memories remain. Most folk who dwelled here when I first arrived still do, their lives as constant as the seasons.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out like any American dream, two-story houses lined up like soldiers at attention. Weekend sounds of children playing drift through the air when the weather turns warm, their voices carrying across empty streets. Quiet rules most days, silence broken only by the occasional passing car or distant lawnmower. Never had no trouble with the people here. They mind their business less you need something, like some unspoken covenant between strangers sharing the same patch of earth.\n\nPackages come and go, untouched on porches like offerings to modern gods. Trust flows easy here, like water in a stream. There's a park nearby, not more than a minute's walk through the trees. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked concrete where we played our games, football too, and baseball when the weather was right. Got my nose broke there once, caught an elbow in a game gone wrong, but the good memories outweigh the bad like gold outweighs lead.\n\nThese days I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them swing and slide like I once did, their joy pure as spring water. The park calls to something deep inside me now, something old and true. The neighborhood's got everything a body could want. Food from all corners of the earth within walking distance - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though most folks now let others bring it to their door through glowing screens and digital prayers.\n\nFast food joints stand on every corner like churches of convenience, and pizza places too, more than you could count. Stores line the streets selling everything from medicine to memories. Two pharmacies face each other across the road like old rivals, a grocery store squats nearby, and there's even a place run by Indian folk where you can find spices that smell like dreams of far-off lands.\n\nSometimes when I read about other neighborhoods, about the darkness that dwells in some places, I know I've been blessed. This place ain't perfect, nothing is in this world, but it's mine and I reckon that's enough.",
            "The college stands near where I live, a blessing or curse depending on the day. Apartment buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a godless sky, their facades weathered and old as sin itself. Between them crouch the bars and eateries where students gather like pilgrims at some forsaken shrine. The new bar they renamed stands prouder than the rest, demanding more coin for the same spirits that flow through all vessels.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes - the young scholars and the poor souls trapped by circumstance in these cheap dwellings. Children too, countless small figures moving in packs near the elementary school that squats at the edge of sight. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how it shall stay, though their constant burning of the devil's weed forced management to mount some plastic contraption that spews artificial freshness into the stale hallway. A joke told in plastic and chemicals.\n\nNew buildings rise down the street, false prophets built of cardboard and promises, charging gold for quarters made of straw. The cheap diner serves its meals on paper like some dystopian soup kitchen, microwaving sustenance for the masses. The gas station stands sentinel, a place where hope goes to die on minimum wage.\n\nThe city's money brought new concrete and grass, as if nature could be purchased and planted like fence posts. Trees shadow my building, their stumps testament to those already fallen. Behind lies 43rd street, a darker reflection of our own, where broken sidewalks tell tales of neglect and crime breeds in the shadows of shabby buildings hidden behind green curtains of leaves.\n\nYet I remain, for the price suits my purse and the university lies within walking distance. The buses come and go like mechanical pilgrims, carrying their human cargo to stores and downtown streets. This is my station now, this purgatory of students and survivors, of concrete and leaves, of hope and decay all mixed together like ash in the wind.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the failing light, white porches stark against the metal roofs green as cedar water. A cul-de-sac where folk gather in the graying dusk, speaking low words that carry on the evening air while young ones mark the concrete with colored chalk or chase their kites against the dimming sky. Like some forgotten time returned. Some ancient memory of how things was.\n\nFields stretch beyond where we stand, trees rising up black against blue skies scattered with clouds white as bone. But the weather turns cruel here. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark like some mechanical banshee and folk scattered to their holes. Found myself crouched in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever vestments of civilization seemed worth saving while the big dog prowled the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own knuckles rapping judgment on the roof.\n\nWhen it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cold, temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five like a stone dropped in deep water. The hail melted where it struck the blacktop still holding the day's heat. Then the sun broke through and the rain came again and there above it all hung twin rainbows like some celestial gateway. Took pictures quick as I could though nothing captured in a box could hold such glory.\n\nThe streets stayed quiet a while longer, folk emerging slow like survivors of some great catastrophe, then life returned as it always does. Women and children gathering while supper cooked in their ovens, talk drifting on the cooling air. Different here from New Hampshire, the voices soft and stretched like warm taffy in the southern way.\n\nBehind the houses lies a field where deer pass silent as smoke and beyond that a pond where no one swims. Mornings the bullfrog sings his ancient song like something left over from the time before time. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world entire. Roosters call across the dawn from hidden farms and in the evening a donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding some artifact of older days, some remnant of what the world was before the world forgot itself.",
            "Ten years in this place. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. First time we come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept like a child though I was one then. Mama and daddy said it was for the better. Better schools. Better houses. Better everything they said. No more ghetto they said. Words dont make a home but time does.\n\nYears passed like wind through dead grass. Made friends. Made enemies too. Neighbors stayed strangers except for Mr Glen and Dennis living next door. Good folk. Almost like blood how close we got. Remember Mr Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him getting hitched again. Whole family went. Mama daddy sister and me watching them dance. Ms Veda in her white dress throwing that little leg strap. Caught it in my hands like a sign. Didnt catch no flowers though. Danced with Marsharii that night. Aint seen her since. Time takes everything.\n\nNeighborhood's like some maze God laid down. Got GPS now but back then just wandered. Went far as I dared with Kason and Curtis. Playing them games. Living like time would never end. Sometimes I go to the park now. Just to be. Just to breathe. Take them sticks from Home Depot. Practice balance like some old warrior monk. Bring my wooden sword too sometimes. Tennis courts and basketball hoops standing empty like grave markers. Aint played in years. Daddy and Mr Graves taught us tennis when we was young. Worked us hard in that summer heat but we smiled through it.\n\nMemory's a kind of cage. Holds all them good times. All them stories. But the best ones aint been lived yet. They're out there waiting in the dark like wolves. Waiting for their time to come.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, settled deep in South Carolina's flesh where the peach trees stood sentinel over the quiet fields. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World the sign declared, weather-worn and proud in its proclamation, though the words meant little now to the scattered souls who dwelled there.\n\nFields stretched out beyond sight, broken only by metal-roofed houses that squatted far back from the road like wary creatures. The buildings rose two stories tall, some wearing gray shingles that had seen better days, others gleaming metallic against the merciless southern sun that beat down day after day without cease.\n\nIn the heart of it all stood a single stoplight, swaying gentle above the crossroads like some mechanical prophet. Round it clustered the few merchants who remained. Hong Kong, where a single family toiled in silence. Fiesta, where Mexican dreams were served on chipped plates. Gary's, with its burgers that tasted of times past. The pizzeria was gone now, nothing but an empty shell and memories of better days.\n\nMaxwell and Halford's still poured cherry cola like blood into paper cups, and the IGA stood proud but costly, its aisles walked mostly by those too desperate or too tired to make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General thrived like a weed in barren soil, its parking lot never empty, its fluorescent lights burning from dawn till dusk.\n\nThe furniture store, Possibilities, sat squat and determined, its owner's kindness legendary among the townsfolk. Next door, Clark's tended to the animals, washing and cleaning God's creatures with careful hands. The doctors, both for man and beast, kept their distance from town center, as if afraid to witness its slow decay.\n\nOne school remained, Johnston Elementary, standing alone like the last tooth in an old man's mouth. After fifth grade the children vanished to other towns, as if drawn away by some invisible tide. They spoke of parks to come, two and a half acres of hope they said would bring new life. But for now the town slept, quiet and still, so small you might pass through it between heartbeats and never know it was there at all.",
            "The street runs between two highways cutting through Tennessee like twin serpents of black asphalt, bearing their endless procession of machines. More traffic than a man might want but the neighborhood stays quiet enough. Folk dont move much here. They come and they stay or they never come at all. You see them working their yards in the morning light, mechanical beasts chewing down the grass from March till October when the growing finally gives out. We got us a house on the corner. Me and the woman and two girls, eleven and fourteen. We watch them all come and go, know their vehicles like we know our own faces. When something strange rolls through we mark it. \n\nIn winter the children take to sledding down the hill on the side street, their voices carrying thin and cold in the gray air. But winter dont come much anymore. Just a long fall that stretches out like a dying man. The trees stand thick here, remnants of what was before. They drop their leaves in drifts come autumn and we burn them in piles that send sweet smoke into the cooling air. The neighborhood filled with shade and shadow, filtered sunlight making patterns on the ground like old lace.\n\nWe work from the house mostly. Stay close to home. Sometimes we'll cook out back, meat dripping fat onto hot coals, smoke rising up past the deck boards like prayers. The garage sits back behind the house and we dont use the front door much except when strangers come calling, which they rarely do. I work on my truck there sometimes, doors standing open to the street, listening to the sounds of living filter in. Children on their bikes. Dogs and their people walking slow in the evening light.\n\nHolidays bring the outsiders. Thanksgiving sees strange cars lining the streets like funeral mourners, Christmas the same. Mother's Day too. But mostly its just us here, going about our business in this place we've made our own. If it werent for them highways bracketing us like prison walls, it might be perfect. But perfect aint in the nature of things. Never was.",
            "The desert stretches out endless and brown, nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. Been here since the 90s when houses stood like lonely sentinels in the waste, scattered wide across the emptiness. Different now. The city grows like some manner of concrete vine, spreading its tendrils through what was once open country. Still got space though. Still got that emptiness that makes a man feel small.\n\nOld folk live round here mostly. Decent people. Keep to themselves but wave when you pass. Chain stores dot the landscape like tumbleweeds - Food for Less, Smart and Final. Aint no fancy stores. Have to drive far for them luxuries. Construction crews work endless, building tomorrow's sprawl. Sound of hammers and saws echo across the flats. Sometimes I watch them from my jobsite where I hang drywall and fit metal frames into endless ceilings, wondering how long before the desert disappears completely.\n\nThe wildlife though. That's what keeps a body sane out here. Desert creatures moving through their ancient rituals, paying no mind to the human world growing round them. My young ones spend their days chasing lizards and hunting bugs in the dust, same as children have done since time was young. They understand something pure in that pursuit that grown folks forget.\n\nCounty fair comes through regular. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like a shroud. Down here in the museum they keep pieces of what was - old bones, Indian things, artifacts from when this place was young. Tells the story of how we came to be here, though sometimes I reckon the desert remembers different. Sometimes in the quiet you can hear it speaking its own truth, waiting patient as stone for us all to pass and be forgotten.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland, buildings rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. He reckons it different from what others might call neighborhood. No picket fences here. No children's bicycles abandoned in driveways. Just dormitories and apartments standing sentinel in the gray morning light, their windows dead and watching.\n\nThe buildings themselves come in three forms, each hosting their own breed of dweller. The apartments stand two stories tall, their weathered faces home to twenty souls or thereabouts, packed in like cattle in their narrow rooms. Then there's the houses, old structures scattered about like dice thrown by some careless god, where the alumni make their home. But it's the dormitories that dominate this concrete kingdom, great rectangular monuments stretching toward a colorless sky, hundreds of students stacked one atop the other in rooms barely big enough to hold their dreams.\n\nThe people here are legion, drawn from every corner of the earth like pilgrims to some secular Mecca. Professional staff occupy the houses like minor nobility, while the young ones, fresh-faced and raw, huddle in their dormitory cells. The older students claim the apartments, marking their territory like wolves grown wise to the ways of the pack.\n\nStores dot the landscape like oases in this academic desert. Food joints hawk their wares alongside clothing shops bearing the institution's mark like some tribal totem. A single park exists, a patch of green amid the gray, kept pristine by some unspoken covenant among the inhabitants. Here they gather, these disparate souls, united in their temporary exile from the world beyond.\n\nAt night the buildings loom darker still, their lit windows like dying stars in a manufactured sky. The campus sleeps fitfully, dreaming dreams of purpose and belonging in this strange colony they've built for themselves, this place that is neither home nor foreign land but something in between, something without name or precedent in the world that was.",
            "Ain't no sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it at an angle, our house perched atop what folks call the workout hill on account of them joggers who grunt their way up its spine each morning like pilgrims seeking salvation. People walk the road itself, broken and pitted like the face of some ancient beast. Above them the power lines hang like black rosaries strung between weathered crosses, patched and mended where storms have torn them down time and again.\n\nThe evergreens stand tall and dark against the sky but folk here hate them with a fury reserved for old enemies. They cut them down with machines that scream into the mist, clearing views to the water below. Houses rise up the hillside like great glass-eyed creatures, each one straining above the other to see the bay. At sunset the water burns like molten copper beneath clouds that hang low and gray as widow's veils most days.\n\nThe damp here is a living thing. Moss creeps across every surface like some slow green plague. Left my truck standing a month and found it claimed by that verdant death, took hours to scrape the ghost of it away. No children here save the ones at the schoolhouse down the road. Instead dogs roam like primitive spirits, silent and watching. Found one in my house once, standing there like it owned the place, its eyes yellow in the gloom.\n\nRabbits move through the streets like shadows. Big ones that the gardeners curse and my cats hunt with a terrible patience. Birds too. Little ones that dart quick as thoughts and sometimes the great dark wings of hawks and eagles until the crows drive them off like small black devils protecting their territory.\n\nDown the hill where the land gives way to water there's places that serve up what the bay provides. No beach there but rocks dark as coal that we throw into the gray waters. The far shore stands like a wall through the eternal mist, close enough to mock us with its presence but too far to reach.",
            "He'd tell you Bensonhurst aint hard to find. The trains and buses run there like veins in a dying man's arm, same as they do all over this concrete maze they call New York. Urban and cold and gray but still breathing. Still alive.\n\nThe streets speak Chinese now. Korean too. Twenty years done changed everything. Every block got its Asian stores like teeth in a crooked smile. Supermarkets and laundromats mostly. The locals, they dont mind. Good food cheap and clean clothes, thats what keeps a neighborhood breathing. Where he lived there was four markets within spitting distance. But it wasnt all Asian folk neither. Place was mixed up like spilled paint, immigrants and their american born young ones all living in the same concrete shadow.\n\nThe park they fixed up stood like an oasis in all that stone. Basketball courts lined up like soldiers. Soccer field stretched out dead and brown. Handball walls wearing their history in scuff marks. Children's swings hanging like gallows in the wind. Summer days the water fountain ran like tears while the children played beneath it. All kinds playing together like the world aint taught em to hate yet.\n\nNo towers here. Just boxes stacked for living. Coops and condos but mostly two family houses lined up and down the streets like grave markers. The people were kind enough but lord the noise. Cars screaming past at all hours, music bleeding through walls, engines roaring like wounded beasts in the dark morning.\n\nNight time was different. Night time you kept your eyes moving. Neighborhood was safe enough they said but evil lurks in men's hearts everywhere. He'd been beaten here once, years back. These days thieves took packages right off porches bold as brass. And dog shit everywhere you stepped, like the rules of men meant nothing to these people. City said clean it up but nobody listened. Nobody ever did.\n\nHe'd seen it all change. Seen it die and be reborn. The streets remembered everything even if the people tried to forget.",
            "You got to understand Portland first. What it means to be weird there. Up on that old building that serves everything from pizza to flesh shows, breaking half the laws God ever wrote, there's words painted saying Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say it's a prayer for old times, when the city was cheaper and stranger and bred things that had no name. Others hear it like a calling, like come here and we'll call you weird but mean it kind like a blessing.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their glass towers reaching up into that gray sky but Portland stays weird all the same. Not that weird means kind exactly. Just means tolerating what other places won't abide. We got our modern troubles same as anywhere. Chinese goods in every store. Normal things too like yoga women and men in suits but somehow it all rides lighter here.\n\nIn my part they paint houses like fever dreams. Gardens growing wild right up through the concrete. And them free boxes. Lord the free boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass. Clothes and books mainly but could be anything. Magic in them sometimes. Perfect thing just waiting there for the right soul to find it. That's Portland to me anyway. But I'm just one kind of strange in this strange land.\n\nSome wouldn't touch them sidewalk treasures. They do their bending with goats instead or scream at men kicking balls in rain-soaked fields. Dreams live here. Or maybe just the dreaming of dreams while the beer flows dark and endless. We got our darkness too. Drugs and broken minds beneath them endless clouds. The rain just keeps coming.\n\nThe homeless gather here like birds to seed, drawn by what little mercy we can spare. More than most places offer but never enough. Never enough. The rest of us toggle between pity and hate, same as anywhere else. In that we ain't weird at all. Just human in our failings. Just lost in our own particular way.",
            "The mountains stood there always. North. Like ancient gods bearing witness to the sun's coming and going, day after weary day. A man could forget them in the mundane turns of life but they remained, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of men. And when the weight of living pressed hardest they'd call out silent and demanding to be seen and a man could turn to them and draw from their strength like water from some deep and ageless well. He'd come here first as a boy hardly grown, to the university that sat in their shadow, and they'd claimed him then and there. The campus had its charms sure enough. Fine buildings and trees and ponds that could steal a piece of a man's heart but the mountains they ruled over all like some old testament deity surveying its domain.\n\nThe town spread out below them pretty enough in its way. Coffee houses where young scholars burned midnight oil and filled themselves with bitter drink to ward off sleep. Downtown not far, reachable by foot or by bus, where old brick buildings stood shoulder to shoulder like tired soldiers, their colors faded by time and weather. Here the town showed its other face, citified and bustling, but it didn't last. Past the library the quiet came back like a tide, washing away the noise and the hurry.\n\nThe place held memories like a cup holds water. Good ones and bad ones both. He'd walked past them rusted swings with friends when dawn was breaking after nights spent awake with books and papers. Run through crowded streets to catch pictures at that fancy theater where the university gave out tickets free. But the ponds, they'd seen darker times. Two AM crying jags when existence itself seemed more weight than a soul could bear. He'd watched the turtles and the ducks going about their business, each one knowing its place in the order of things while he searched his own heart for purpose like a man searching a dark room for something lost.\n\nSo he walked. Past pond and park and houses all neat and proper in their suburban rows until he came to the main road. The sun was coming up then, laying its gold across the palm trees, painting the sky in colors that had no names. He was walking north without knowing it and there they were. Always there. The mountains rose up past every building man had raised, touching that yellow-blue dawn sky like something holy. They spoke without words into his heart and gave him the strength to go on.",
            "You wouldnt see it first passing. Just houses behind the stores. Not the kind folks choose willing but the kind they end up in when there aint nowhere else to go. Past the dead Whole Foods and them hotels that stand empty save summer reunions theres a whole world breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like great concrete beasts laid down careful beside each other, sleeping. First ones got trouble written in the papers but we wont speak on that. Truth aint always what gets told.\n\nNext buildings over different though. Different world entire. College across the way. Small campus. Quiet. Students drift in early morning with their coffee cups like ghosts. Iron gates screech their welcome while cars stack up behind, drivers cursing the slow parade of learning.\n\nRoad ends at another. Park on one side. Healing place on the other where broken folk try to mend. Got chairs out front and a fan that just turns and turns in the thick air like it's stirring soup. Children run wild in the park grass, spinning like drunk angels while bees work the flowers dont care about nothing but their business. Old folk walking dogs eye the skateboard kids like they're studying sin itself. Girls bunch up by the swings talking about boys and whatever lights up their phones these days.\n\nStrip mall sits watching it all. Sushi place never full but keeps on. Swimming store. Place for painting nails. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Feed yourself. Fill your pool. Fix your hands. Got one of them yogurt places too where you serve yourself like playing God with toppings. Kids from the park go there. Stand around with their cups sweating in the heat while they blow smoke and try to look like something they aint yet.\n\nThis here's a piece of the old south. Time moves different here. Like molasses in winter. Some things dont need changing. Some things just need leaving be.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels of a forgotten time. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins in the gray light of morning. Small patches of earth they called yards lay before each dwelling and narrow strips of concrete for the automobiles that came and went like mechanical ghosts. They were remnants of some older dream. The American dream they'd called it. It had took hold of the people once but now it was letting go slow and quiet like a dying man's grip.\n\nThe neighborhood persisted. It called out still to those who passed through. Called out in a voice that grew weaker with each season. Folk didn't carry the light in their eyes no more and the yards grew wild where once they'd been kept neat as Sunday clothes. But automobiles still squatted in every drive and the young ones played in the street like there wasnt nothing in the world beyond the block they stood on.\n\nThe school building rose up like some ancient temple. Ninety years it had stood. Ninety years of children passing through its halls dreaming dreams that mostly died before they got born. Churches stood empty now save for dust and memories but the basketball courts rang with life. Each house different from the next yet carrying the same weight of years.\n\nThe market belonged to the Yemen folk. Only Arab family for miles. Most everyone else carried African blood. Wide streets where children played at football and scattered like quail when cars came through. Old folk who'd been there since forever told tales of times when every soul knew every other soul by name.\n\nWhere the karate school had been there was now a pharmacy. Seems folk had decided chemical comfort was worth more than knowing how to fight. The picture show still ran old films at cut rate prices. Young ones stayed away like it carried plague but the elders came regular. Called it a bargain.\n\nThe expressway passed through but didn't stop. Young ones wanted an exit ramp but the elders knew better. Knew that kind of progress was really just decay wearing a fancy suit. New school going up now. They were fixing to pick some kind of mascot. Someone said a cyborg in a log cabin. Like trying to marry tomorrow to yesterday. But maybe that's what the whole place was doing anyway.",
            "The city stretches endless and gray before him, a maze of concrete and steel rising up like the bones of some ancient beast. He watches from his window. Buildings scattered without purpose or meaning between the storefronts and offices that stand like tombstones in the failing light. Restaurants and shops line the streets like desperate mourners, some bearing the marks of corporate ownership while others stand alone, defiant in their independence. The streets wind through it all like dried riverbeds.\n\nParks dot the landscape, small patches of green amid the waste where children still play, their laughter a strange echo in this concrete valley. The people here exist in tribes, each claiming their territory in the urban expanse. The rainbow folk. The orthodox with their black coats and ancient ways. The Russians who fled their homeland carrying memories like stones in their pockets. And beyond, more tribes still. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. All of them separated by mere miles that stretch into hours in the grinding traffic that moves like cold molasses through the arteries of the city.\n\nNobody walks here anymore. They sit sealed in their metal coffins, crawling through the endless congestion, searching for spaces to abandon their vehicles in the vast parking lots that spread like cancer across the land. The city grows despite itself, new towers rising up daily, steel frames reaching toward a sun that rarely breaks through the smog. The old residents watch with dead eyes as more come, always more, drawn to this place like moths to a flame.\n\nHouses stand in varying states of decay and splendor. Some meant for single souls, others stacked like cargo containers, full of bodies pressed together in their separate solitudes. He remembers when he knew his neighbors, when children played in streets that now stand empty save for the occasional passing car. He remembers the girl next door, her face now lost to time, their laughter echoing across summers that exist only in memory. But that world is gone now, replaced by this new reality where strangers pass each other without a glance, each locked in their own private apocalypse.",
            "She looked out at the endless fields and asked where everything was. I told her this was all of it knowing full well how the emptiness would strike her. She'd come from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home and had never known such vastness. The corn stretched out like a dead sea meeting the horizon and I told her what it was to grow up in these parts of Ohio and she knew me then as she hadnt before.\n\nThe quarry water lay black and still beyond the two-lane road that led to where the houses stood. Brick and stucco dwellings each claiming their half acre of god's earth that folk tended like prayer. Come spring the flowers would rise up among the trees that changed their colors like ancient ceremonies. The driveways held German machines that caught the light like mirrors after the washing.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. Always outside. Always singing above his mower's drone like some strange prophet of the grass. Folk smiled at his ways but knew him for what he was. A doctor once. Now just an old man growing older, fading like evening light into the green he tended with his John Deere machine.\n\nOur house stood grey against the sky. Geese moved like pale ghosts across the yard while the terrier gave chase. The stream behind whispered its way to the quarry waters and bullfrogs called into the dusk. Sometimes a cow's moan carried over from the distant farms. Past the wooden bridge we'd built lay a world untouched. Trees and wildflowers and herbs that grew as they pleased. This was my childhood kingdom. We built fortresses in the trees and stalked through the undergrowth playing at hunters. There were always children then. Always someone to share in the dreaming.\n\nWinter came like judgment. The yard that was green turned to emptiness. Trees that had bloomed pink and purple stood naked and black against the gray sky. Snow would come in the night and transform everything. My sister's angels pressed into the white. Snowmen rose up like sentinels. We warred with packed snow, building walls of ice and branch to shelter our arsenal. In that frozen realm we played at life while life played at us, unknowing and uncaring of what lay ahead. We were children still. That was all we knew to be."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Here in the heartland where the farms give way to tourist towns there aint no malls nor chain stores nor restaurants with neon signs. Just empty roads stretching out between places. But the water surrounds us like some ancient guardian. Lake Michigan vast and cold to one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other, their waters pure and deep as time itself. Beaches everywhere you might care to walk.\n\nThe houses stand apart from one another like old sentinels. No matching facades here. Each one bearing the marks of years lived and worked, some renewed by careful hands, others wearing their age like medals. Their foundations rise from the earth, visible from the street, dark mouths gaping at passersby. Aluminum siding in every shade God gave permission for, weathered by countless seasons. Yards spread out wide and green where children's dreams take shape in trampolines and wooden towers. Gardens push up through black soil and wire fences pen in creatures both domestic and loved.\n\nThese are the homes of working folk. People who know the weight of a day's labor and the sound of children's feet on wooden stairs. You'll see them out there, the young ones running wild in the street, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs walking their masters, bikes spinning silent wheels. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. Someone's always got meat on the fire, smoke rising in thin blue columns against the sky. Folk wave and nod, knowing smiles passed like currency.\n\nThe grass stays cut and neat, no dead leaves permitted to gather and rot. Everything trimmed and ordered, not from pride but from respect for what's been built here. It aint beautiful in the way that rich folk measure beauty, but it's got something better. Something true. Something that whispers home and safety in the language of ordinary hearts.\n\nThe sheriff's office squats nearby, and the jail beside it like its darker brother. Health department too, all of them within walking distance. The recycling center hums with the business of waste and renewal. Baseball fields echo with tinny voices calling out americana through crackling speakers. Small planes drone overhead like mechanical dragonflies, taking off and landing at the town airport that ain't much more than a strip of concrete.\n\nIce cream can be had by foot, and downtown aint far if you've got the will to walk it. Children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through the heart of what we've built here. It ain't much, measured against the grand scales of cities. But it's something real. Something that endures.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in their ordered rows, each one a mirror of its neighbor, all of them bound by the invisible chains of the homeowners association that ruled here. Not a blade of grass grew wrong. Not a stone lay crooked in the decorative beds. The driveways ran short and clean to the two-car garages that gaped like standardized wounds in the faces of the homes.\n\nThey'd laid fresh concrete on the roads. Black and perfect. No rupture or crack to mar the surface. No history written there. Single story houses mostly though some rose higher, reaching up as if to touch the empty sky. No mailboxes stood at attention before the homes like in other places. Instead they'd gathered them in clusters at the street ends, metal and gleaming, requiring keys like prison cells.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the edge of things, where civilization met the wild lands that still remembered what came before. Swimming pools stood behind gates, their waters blue and cold and dead. Walking trails wound through the spaces between, worn smooth by the passing of countless feet. Old folk mostly dwelt here, their time spent watching from windows, guarding what remained of their ordered world. Some younger ones too, but fewer, as if the place preferred its inhabitants gray and quiet.\n\nThe city spread beyond, vast in its way but carrying still some remnant of smaller days. One mall stood like a monument to commerce, neither grand nor mean, serving its purpose without ceremony. Fifteen minutes drive through the gathering sprawl would take you to the merchants. They had everything there. Places where the wealthy could buy their clean food, places where the poor could stretch their dollars thin. All of it waiting just beyond the horizon of houses.\n\nThis was a safe place. A clean place. A place where people watched out for their own though they knew not why. The pools lay waiting. The trails wound on. And all of it held together by rules and order and the fear of what chaos might come should the center not hold.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the disappeared. Strange thing to hear of such matters in a district where folk paid thousand-dollar tithes each month just to lay their heads. None I knew had heard these tales neither. Mayhap its the weight of living crushing down. Known some who weep in the nighttime hours when the darkness comes. Things dear now, dearer than before, but we learned the way of less. Come to know the smell of dead mens clothes and broken toys, dust-covered and waiting. The nose grows dull with age. Some take to smoke. Some just forget what clean air tastes like.\n\nThe fleamarket persists like some ancient thing. Smells like magazines yellowed with time stacked on dead pianos. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned. Three houses of the discarded within walking distance. Start at the far end, you can make your way through charity shops, library stacks, rare books and curiosities. Downtown packed tight with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like water but the thrift stores stay quiet as tombs. Good place to lose yourself when the hours stretch long.\n\nEvery year brings more. They say its growing, this city. Home to some great digital empire dealing in wants and needs, still stretching its skin like some young beast. Makes me think on New York. Everyone carrying their own weight, asking nothing. Can keep to yourself here, quiet-like, and none will disturb your peace. Not like down South where concern means care. Here you keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like dark water.\n\nLife moves through it though. Got a piano player next door, singers up above. Less strangers now, more like kin. We gather when needs must, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Found some fortune here maybe. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Keep clean, share food, pass letters back and forth. Good to see them, think they feel the same about me. Living in this great concrete maze but its the people make it feel like home instead of damnation.",
            "The town lies just beyond the reach of the city, a small midwestern place where the edges blur into cornfields and forgotten lots. We live on the east side where the houses stand weathered and gray, paint peeling like old scabs, where folks make do with less than most. Not an ugly place though. People still nod and speak when you pass, their eyes carrying something like hope or maybe just resignation.\n\nThe violence comes and goes like weather. Gunshots sometimes in the night, far off or close, you cant always tell. The neighbors boy got killed outside the tavern last summer. Just another soul gone to whatever waits in the dark. Sometimes things disappear from porches. Small things. Things folks forget to bring inside when night comes.\n\nThe poison that's killing these people aint natural. Fentanyl they call it. It moves through the streets like a ghost taking whoever it wants. The town tries to fight it with clinics and meetings where they teach people how to bring back the dead. Sometimes it works. Mostly it dont.\n\nThe boy goes to school where they feed all the children because hunger dont care about pride. Good people there. They watch over him like he was their own despite whatever's different about him. He comes home happy most days. The school has gatherings where families come together like they used to in the old days, before everything got broken.\n\nThe city men fix up the streets and parks where the money folks live and shop, on the west side where everything shines a little brighter. Our side stays dark. That's just how it is and how it's always been. Been here sixteen years now. The house aint much but it keeps out the rain and holds whatever warmth we can gather. This is our place. Whatever that means. Whatever that's worth.",
            "The neighborhood sits atop the hill like some ancient god's throne, buildings old as sin rising up from streets that remember. Seven stories up I watch the theater across the way, its facade weathered and knowing. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather when the warmth comes, lined up like penitents before some neon shrine, the arcade machines within humming their electric psalms into the night air.\n\nThe park sprawls vast and grey above it all, ringed in concrete and steps that rise like the ribs of some fallen beast. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents arrayed in desperate geometry against the cold. Rain comes biblical and merciless, driving them closer together for what meager warmth bodies can share. They cluster near the family center where steam rises from showers like prayers unanswered.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that makes this place. Aint the proud bones of buildings nor the hills that roll down toward the sea like waves frozen in time. Its the people carrying their stories like scars. Hilltop they called it, bloodiest corner of the western world once. Federal men came through like locusts, DEA badges glinting like false stars. The people remember. Stories pass like dark wine from lip to lip, generation to generation, seeping into transplants like me till we taste the bitter truth of it.\n\nThey tell white folk to stay clear after dark, words carrying the rust of old fears. Maybe its that my skin carries just enough shadow to pass, or maybe the Hill knows its own. Knows them that understand how fear and ignorance breed in the dark corners of a nation that calls itself enlightened.\n\nThe streets know me now. Known me through nights when strangers offered warmth instead of harm. Known me in the laundromat woman's mercy, letting me shelter when the rain came biblical. Known me huddled invisible against storefronts grey as tomb walls, till some passing soul stopped to press paper money in my hand and speak of beauty and worth like some street corner prophet.\n\nThis is my place now. These streets. These people. This hill that rises like truth above the city, bearing its weight of memory and hope into the gunmetal sky.",
            "I came to this place in the late summer before eighth grade commenced, the houses standing like sentinels in the fading light. Two boys lived nearby then, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, though they're gone now, scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. But the memories remain. Most folk who dwelled here when I first arrived still do, their lives as constant as the seasons.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out like any American dream, two-story houses lined up like soldiers at attention. Weekend sounds of children playing drift through the air when the weather turns warm, their voices carrying across empty streets. Quiet rules most days, silence broken only by the occasional passing car or distant lawnmower. Never had no trouble with the people here. They mind their business less you need something, like some unspoken covenant between strangers sharing the same patch of earth.\n\nPackages come and go, untouched on porches like offerings to modern gods. Trust flows easy here, like water in a stream. There's a park nearby, not more than a minute's walk through the trees. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked concrete where we played our games, football too, and baseball when the weather was right. Got my nose broke there once, caught an elbow in a game gone wrong, but the good memories outweigh the bad like gold outweighs lead.\n\nThese days I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them swing and slide like I once did, their joy pure as spring water. The park calls to something deep inside me now, something old and true. The neighborhood's got everything a body could want. Food from all corners of the earth within walking distance - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though most folks now let others bring it to their door through glowing screens and digital prayers.\n\nFast food joints stand on every corner like churches of convenience, and pizza places too, more than you could count. Stores line the streets selling everything from medicine to memories. Two pharmacies face each other across the road like old rivals, a grocery store squats nearby, and there's even a place run by Indian folk where you can find spices that smell like dreams of far-off lands.\n\nSometimes when I read about other neighborhoods, about the darkness that dwells in some places, I know I've been blessed. This place ain't perfect, nothing is in this world, but it's mine and I reckon that's enough.",
            "The college stands near where I live, a blessing or curse depending on the day. Apartment buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a godless sky, their facades weathered and old as sin itself. Between them crouch the bars and eateries where students gather like pilgrims at some forsaken shrine. The new bar they renamed stands prouder than the rest, demanding more coin for the same spirits that flow through all vessels.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes - the young scholars and the poor souls trapped by circumstance in these cheap dwellings. Children too, countless small figures moving in packs near the elementary school that squats at the edge of sight. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how it shall stay, though their constant burning of the devil's weed forced management to mount some plastic contraption that spews artificial freshness into the stale hallway. A joke told in plastic and chemicals.\n\nNew buildings rise down the street, false prophets built of cardboard and promises, charging gold for quarters made of straw. The cheap diner serves its meals on paper like some dystopian soup kitchen, microwaving sustenance for the masses. The gas station stands sentinel, a place where hope goes to die on minimum wage.\n\nThe city's money brought new concrete and grass, as if nature could be purchased and planted like fence posts. Trees shadow my building, their stumps testament to those already fallen. Behind lies 43rd street, a darker reflection of our own, where broken sidewalks tell tales of neglect and crime breeds in the shadows of shabby buildings hidden behind green curtains of leaves.\n\nYet I remain, for the price suits my purse and the university lies within walking distance. The buses come and go like mechanical pilgrims, carrying their human cargo to stores and downtown streets. This is my station now, this purgatory of students and survivors, of concrete and leaves, of hope and decay all mixed together like ash in the wind.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the failing light, white porches stark against the metal roofs green as cedar water. A cul-de-sac where folk gather in the graying dusk, speaking low words that carry on the evening air while young ones mark the concrete with colored chalk or chase their kites against the dimming sky. Like some forgotten time returned. Some ancient memory of how things was.\n\nFields stretch beyond where we stand, trees rising up black against blue skies scattered with clouds white as bone. But the weather turns cruel here. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark like some mechanical banshee and folk scattered to their holes. Found myself crouched in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever vestments of civilization seemed worth saving while the big dog prowled the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own knuckles rapping judgment on the roof.\n\nWhen it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cold, temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five like a stone dropped in deep water. The hail melted where it struck the blacktop still holding the day's heat. Then the sun broke through and the rain came again and there above it all hung twin rainbows like some celestial gateway. Took pictures quick as I could though nothing captured in a box could hold such glory.\n\nThe streets stayed quiet a while longer, folk emerging slow like survivors of some great catastrophe, then life returned as it always does. Women and children gathering while supper cooked in their ovens, talk drifting on the cooling air. Different here from New Hampshire, the voices soft and stretched like warm taffy in the southern way.\n\nBehind the houses lies a field where deer pass silent as smoke and beyond that a pond where no one swims. Mornings the bullfrog sings his ancient song like something left over from the time before time. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world entire. Roosters call across the dawn from hidden farms and in the evening a donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding some artifact of older days, some remnant of what the world was before the world forgot itself.",
            "Ten years in this place. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. First time we come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept like a child though I was one then. Mama and daddy said it was for the better. Better schools. Better houses. Better everything they said. No more ghetto they said. Words dont make a home but time does.\n\nYears passed like wind through dead grass. Made friends. Made enemies too. Neighbors stayed strangers except for Mr Glen and Dennis living next door. Good folk. Almost like blood how close we got. Remember Mr Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him getting hitched again. Whole family went. Mama daddy sister and me watching them dance. Ms Veda in her white dress throwing that little leg strap. Caught it in my hands like a sign. Didnt catch no flowers though. Danced with Marsharii that night. Aint seen her since. Time takes everything.\n\nNeighborhood's like some maze God laid down. Got GPS now but back then just wandered. Went far as I dared with Kason and Curtis. Playing them games. Living like time would never end. Sometimes I go to the park now. Just to be. Just to breathe. Take them sticks from Home Depot. Practice balance like some old warrior monk. Bring my wooden sword too sometimes. Tennis courts and basketball hoops standing empty like grave markers. Aint played in years. Daddy and Mr Graves taught us tennis when we was young. Worked us hard in that summer heat but we smiled through it.\n\nMemory's a kind of cage. Holds all them good times. All them stories. But the best ones aint been lived yet. They're out there waiting in the dark like wolves. Waiting for their time to come.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, settled deep in South Carolina's flesh where the peach trees stood sentinel over the quiet fields. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World the sign declared, weather-worn and proud in its proclamation, though the words meant little now to the scattered souls who dwelled there.\n\nFields stretched out beyond sight, broken only by metal-roofed houses that squatted far back from the road like wary creatures. The buildings rose two stories tall, some wearing gray shingles that had seen better days, others gleaming metallic against the merciless southern sun that beat down day after day without cease.\n\nIn the heart of it all stood a single stoplight, swaying gentle above the crossroads like some mechanical prophet. Round it clustered the few merchants who remained. Hong Kong, where a single family toiled in silence. Fiesta, where Mexican dreams were served on chipped plates. Gary's, with its burgers that tasted of times past. The pizzeria was gone now, nothing but an empty shell and memories of better days.\n\nMaxwell and Halford's still poured cherry cola like blood into paper cups, and the IGA stood proud but costly, its aisles walked mostly by those too desperate or too tired to make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General thrived like a weed in barren soil, its parking lot never empty, its fluorescent lights burning from dawn till dusk.\n\nThe furniture store, Possibilities, sat squat and determined, its owner's kindness legendary among the townsfolk. Next door, Clark's tended to the animals, washing and cleaning God's creatures with careful hands. The doctors, both for man and beast, kept their distance from town center, as if afraid to witness its slow decay.\n\nOne school remained, Johnston Elementary, standing alone like the last tooth in an old man's mouth. After fifth grade the children vanished to other towns, as if drawn away by some invisible tide. They spoke of parks to come, two and a half acres of hope they said would bring new life. But for now the town slept, quiet and still, so small you might pass through it between heartbeats and never know it was there at all.",
            "The street runs between two highways cutting through Tennessee like twin serpents of black asphalt, bearing their endless procession of machines. More traffic than a man might want but the neighborhood stays quiet enough. Folk dont move much here. They come and they stay or they never come at all. You see them working their yards in the morning light, mechanical beasts chewing down the grass from March till October when the growing finally gives out. We got us a house on the corner. Me and the woman and two girls, eleven and fourteen. We watch them all come and go, know their vehicles like we know our own faces. When something strange rolls through we mark it. \n\nIn winter the children take to sledding down the hill on the side street, their voices carrying thin and cold in the gray air. But winter dont come much anymore. Just a long fall that stretches out like a dying man. The trees stand thick here, remnants of what was before. They drop their leaves in drifts come autumn and we burn them in piles that send sweet smoke into the cooling air. The neighborhood filled with shade and shadow, filtered sunlight making patterns on the ground like old lace.\n\nWe work from the house mostly. Stay close to home. Sometimes we'll cook out back, meat dripping fat onto hot coals, smoke rising up past the deck boards like prayers. The garage sits back behind the house and we dont use the front door much except when strangers come calling, which they rarely do. I work on my truck there sometimes, doors standing open to the street, listening to the sounds of living filter in. Children on their bikes. Dogs and their people walking slow in the evening light.\n\nHolidays bring the outsiders. Thanksgiving sees strange cars lining the streets like funeral mourners, Christmas the same. Mother's Day too. But mostly its just us here, going about our business in this place we've made our own. If it werent for them highways bracketing us like prison walls, it might be perfect. But perfect aint in the nature of things. Never was.",
            "The desert stretches out endless and brown, nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. Been here since the 90s when houses stood like lonely sentinels in the waste, scattered wide across the emptiness. Different now. The city grows like some manner of concrete vine, spreading its tendrils through what was once open country. Still got space though. Still got that emptiness that makes a man feel small.\n\nOld folk live round here mostly. Decent people. Keep to themselves but wave when you pass. Chain stores dot the landscape like tumbleweeds - Food for Less, Smart and Final. Aint no fancy stores. Have to drive far for them luxuries. Construction crews work endless, building tomorrow's sprawl. Sound of hammers and saws echo across the flats. Sometimes I watch them from my jobsite where I hang drywall and fit metal frames into endless ceilings, wondering how long before the desert disappears completely.\n\nThe wildlife though. That's what keeps a body sane out here. Desert creatures moving through their ancient rituals, paying no mind to the human world growing round them. My young ones spend their days chasing lizards and hunting bugs in the dust, same as children have done since time was young. They understand something pure in that pursuit that grown folks forget.\n\nCounty fair comes through regular. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like a shroud. Down here in the museum they keep pieces of what was - old bones, Indian things, artifacts from when this place was young. Tells the story of how we came to be here, though sometimes I reckon the desert remembers different. Sometimes in the quiet you can hear it speaking its own truth, waiting patient as stone for us all to pass and be forgotten.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland, buildings rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. He reckons it different from what others might call neighborhood. No picket fences here. No children's bicycles abandoned in driveways. Just dormitories and apartments standing sentinel in the gray morning light, their windows dead and watching.\n\nThe buildings themselves come in three forms, each hosting their own breed of dweller. The apartments stand two stories tall, their weathered faces home to twenty souls or thereabouts, packed in like cattle in their narrow rooms. Then there's the houses, old structures scattered about like dice thrown by some careless god, where the alumni make their home. But it's the dormitories that dominate this concrete kingdom, great rectangular monuments stretching toward a colorless sky, hundreds of students stacked one atop the other in rooms barely big enough to hold their dreams.\n\nThe people here are legion, drawn from every corner of the earth like pilgrims to some secular Mecca. Professional staff occupy the houses like minor nobility, while the young ones, fresh-faced and raw, huddle in their dormitory cells. The older students claim the apartments, marking their territory like wolves grown wise to the ways of the pack.\n\nStores dot the landscape like oases in this academic desert. Food joints hawk their wares alongside clothing shops bearing the institution's mark like some tribal totem. A single park exists, a patch of green amid the gray, kept pristine by some unspoken covenant among the inhabitants. Here they gather, these disparate souls, united in their temporary exile from the world beyond.\n\nAt night the buildings loom darker still, their lit windows like dying stars in a manufactured sky. The campus sleeps fitfully, dreaming dreams of purpose and belonging in this strange colony they've built for themselves, this place that is neither home nor foreign land but something in between, something without name or precedent in the world that was.",
            "Ain't no sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it at an angle, our house perched atop what folks call the workout hill on account of them joggers who grunt their way up its spine each morning like pilgrims seeking salvation. People walk the road itself, broken and pitted like the face of some ancient beast. Above them the power lines hang like black rosaries strung between weathered crosses, patched and mended where storms have torn them down time and again.\n\nThe evergreens stand tall and dark against the sky but folk here hate them with a fury reserved for old enemies. They cut them down with machines that scream into the mist, clearing views to the water below. Houses rise up the hillside like great glass-eyed creatures, each one straining above the other to see the bay. At sunset the water burns like molten copper beneath clouds that hang low and gray as widow's veils most days.\n\nThe damp here is a living thing. Moss creeps across every surface like some slow green plague. Left my truck standing a month and found it claimed by that verdant death, took hours to scrape the ghost of it away. No children here save the ones at the schoolhouse down the road. Instead dogs roam like primitive spirits, silent and watching. Found one in my house once, standing there like it owned the place, its eyes yellow in the gloom.\n\nRabbits move through the streets like shadows. Big ones that the gardeners curse and my cats hunt with a terrible patience. Birds too. Little ones that dart quick as thoughts and sometimes the great dark wings of hawks and eagles until the crows drive them off like small black devils protecting their territory.\n\nDown the hill where the land gives way to water there's places that serve up what the bay provides. No beach there but rocks dark as coal that we throw into the gray waters. The far shore stands like a wall through the eternal mist, close enough to mock us with its presence but too far to reach.",
            "He'd tell you Bensonhurst aint hard to find. The trains and buses run there like veins in a dying man's arm, same as they do all over this concrete maze they call New York. Urban and cold and gray but still breathing. Still alive.\n\nThe streets speak Chinese now. Korean too. Twenty years done changed everything. Every block got its Asian stores like teeth in a crooked smile. Supermarkets and laundromats mostly. The locals, they dont mind. Good food cheap and clean clothes, thats what keeps a neighborhood breathing. Where he lived there was four markets within spitting distance. But it wasnt all Asian folk neither. Place was mixed up like spilled paint, immigrants and their american born young ones all living in the same concrete shadow.\n\nThe park they fixed up stood like an oasis in all that stone. Basketball courts lined up like soldiers. Soccer field stretched out dead and brown. Handball walls wearing their history in scuff marks. Children's swings hanging like gallows in the wind. Summer days the water fountain ran like tears while the children played beneath it. All kinds playing together like the world aint taught em to hate yet.\n\nNo towers here. Just boxes stacked for living. Coops and condos but mostly two family houses lined up and down the streets like grave markers. The people were kind enough but lord the noise. Cars screaming past at all hours, music bleeding through walls, engines roaring like wounded beasts in the dark morning.\n\nNight time was different. Night time you kept your eyes moving. Neighborhood was safe enough they said but evil lurks in men's hearts everywhere. He'd been beaten here once, years back. These days thieves took packages right off porches bold as brass. And dog shit everywhere you stepped, like the rules of men meant nothing to these people. City said clean it up but nobody listened. Nobody ever did.\n\nHe'd seen it all change. Seen it die and be reborn. The streets remembered everything even if the people tried to forget.",
            "You got to understand Portland first. What it means to be weird there. Up on that old building that serves everything from pizza to flesh shows, breaking half the laws God ever wrote, there's words painted saying Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say it's a prayer for old times, when the city was cheaper and stranger and bred things that had no name. Others hear it like a calling, like come here and we'll call you weird but mean it kind like a blessing.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their glass towers reaching up into that gray sky but Portland stays weird all the same. Not that weird means kind exactly. Just means tolerating what other places won't abide. We got our modern troubles same as anywhere. Chinese goods in every store. Normal things too like yoga women and men in suits but somehow it all rides lighter here.\n\nIn my part they paint houses like fever dreams. Gardens growing wild right up through the concrete. And them free boxes. Lord the free boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass. Clothes and books mainly but could be anything. Magic in them sometimes. Perfect thing just waiting there for the right soul to find it. That's Portland to me anyway. But I'm just one kind of strange in this strange land.\n\nSome wouldn't touch them sidewalk treasures. They do their bending with goats instead or scream at men kicking balls in rain-soaked fields. Dreams live here. Or maybe just the dreaming of dreams while the beer flows dark and endless. We got our darkness too. Drugs and broken minds beneath them endless clouds. The rain just keeps coming.\n\nThe homeless gather here like birds to seed, drawn by what little mercy we can spare. More than most places offer but never enough. Never enough. The rest of us toggle between pity and hate, same as anywhere else. In that we ain't weird at all. Just human in our failings. Just lost in our own particular way.",
            "The mountains stood there always. North. Like ancient gods bearing witness to the sun's coming and going, day after weary day. A man could forget them in the mundane turns of life but they remained, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of men. And when the weight of living pressed hardest they'd call out silent and demanding to be seen and a man could turn to them and draw from their strength like water from some deep and ageless well. He'd come here first as a boy hardly grown, to the university that sat in their shadow, and they'd claimed him then and there. The campus had its charms sure enough. Fine buildings and trees and ponds that could steal a piece of a man's heart but the mountains they ruled over all like some old testament deity surveying its domain.\n\nThe town spread out below them pretty enough in its way. Coffee houses where young scholars burned midnight oil and filled themselves with bitter drink to ward off sleep. Downtown not far, reachable by foot or by bus, where old brick buildings stood shoulder to shoulder like tired soldiers, their colors faded by time and weather. Here the town showed its other face, citified and bustling, but it didn't last. Past the library the quiet came back like a tide, washing away the noise and the hurry.\n\nThe place held memories like a cup holds water. Good ones and bad ones both. He'd walked past them rusted swings with friends when dawn was breaking after nights spent awake with books and papers. Run through crowded streets to catch pictures at that fancy theater where the university gave out tickets free. But the ponds, they'd seen darker times. Two AM crying jags when existence itself seemed more weight than a soul could bear. He'd watched the turtles and the ducks going about their business, each one knowing its place in the order of things while he searched his own heart for purpose like a man searching a dark room for something lost.\n\nSo he walked. Past pond and park and houses all neat and proper in their suburban rows until he came to the main road. The sun was coming up then, laying its gold across the palm trees, painting the sky in colors that had no names. He was walking north without knowing it and there they were. Always there. The mountains rose up past every building man had raised, touching that yellow-blue dawn sky like something holy. They spoke without words into his heart and gave him the strength to go on.",
            "You wouldnt see it first passing. Just houses behind the stores. Not the kind folks choose willing but the kind they end up in when there aint nowhere else to go. Past the dead Whole Foods and them hotels that stand empty save summer reunions theres a whole world breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like great concrete beasts laid down careful beside each other, sleeping. First ones got trouble written in the papers but we wont speak on that. Truth aint always what gets told.\n\nNext buildings over different though. Different world entire. College across the way. Small campus. Quiet. Students drift in early morning with their coffee cups like ghosts. Iron gates screech their welcome while cars stack up behind, drivers cursing the slow parade of learning.\n\nRoad ends at another. Park on one side. Healing place on the other where broken folk try to mend. Got chairs out front and a fan that just turns and turns in the thick air like it's stirring soup. Children run wild in the park grass, spinning like drunk angels while bees work the flowers dont care about nothing but their business. Old folk walking dogs eye the skateboard kids like they're studying sin itself. Girls bunch up by the swings talking about boys and whatever lights up their phones these days.\n\nStrip mall sits watching it all. Sushi place never full but keeps on. Swimming store. Place for painting nails. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Feed yourself. Fill your pool. Fix your hands. Got one of them yogurt places too where you serve yourself like playing God with toppings. Kids from the park go there. Stand around with their cups sweating in the heat while they blow smoke and try to look like something they aint yet.\n\nThis here's a piece of the old south. Time moves different here. Like molasses in winter. Some things dont need changing. Some things just need leaving be.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels of a forgotten time. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins in the gray light of morning. Small patches of earth they called yards lay before each dwelling and narrow strips of concrete for the automobiles that came and went like mechanical ghosts. They were remnants of some older dream. The American dream they'd called it. It had took hold of the people once but now it was letting go slow and quiet like a dying man's grip.\n\nThe neighborhood persisted. It called out still to those who passed through. Called out in a voice that grew weaker with each season. Folk didn't carry the light in their eyes no more and the yards grew wild where once they'd been kept neat as Sunday clothes. But automobiles still squatted in every drive and the young ones played in the street like there wasnt nothing in the world beyond the block they stood on.\n\nThe school building rose up like some ancient temple. Ninety years it had stood. Ninety years of children passing through its halls dreaming dreams that mostly died before they got born. Churches stood empty now save for dust and memories but the basketball courts rang with life. Each house different from the next yet carrying the same weight of years.\n\nThe market belonged to the Yemen folk. Only Arab family for miles. Most everyone else carried African blood. Wide streets where children played at football and scattered like quail when cars came through. Old folk who'd been there since forever told tales of times when every soul knew every other soul by name.\n\nWhere the karate school had been there was now a pharmacy. Seems folk had decided chemical comfort was worth more than knowing how to fight. The picture show still ran old films at cut rate prices. Young ones stayed away like it carried plague but the elders came regular. Called it a bargain.\n\nThe expressway passed through but didn't stop. Young ones wanted an exit ramp but the elders knew better. Knew that kind of progress was really just decay wearing a fancy suit. New school going up now. They were fixing to pick some kind of mascot. Someone said a cyborg in a log cabin. Like trying to marry tomorrow to yesterday. But maybe that's what the whole place was doing anyway.",
            "The city stretches endless and gray before him, a maze of concrete and steel rising up like the bones of some ancient beast. He watches from his window. Buildings scattered without purpose or meaning between the storefronts and offices that stand like tombstones in the failing light. Restaurants and shops line the streets like desperate mourners, some bearing the marks of corporate ownership while others stand alone, defiant in their independence. The streets wind through it all like dried riverbeds.\n\nParks dot the landscape, small patches of green amid the waste where children still play, their laughter a strange echo in this concrete valley. The people here exist in tribes, each claiming their territory in the urban expanse. The rainbow folk. The orthodox with their black coats and ancient ways. The Russians who fled their homeland carrying memories like stones in their pockets. And beyond, more tribes still. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. All of them separated by mere miles that stretch into hours in the grinding traffic that moves like cold molasses through the arteries of the city.\n\nNobody walks here anymore. They sit sealed in their metal coffins, crawling through the endless congestion, searching for spaces to abandon their vehicles in the vast parking lots that spread like cancer across the land. The city grows despite itself, new towers rising up daily, steel frames reaching toward a sun that rarely breaks through the smog. The old residents watch with dead eyes as more come, always more, drawn to this place like moths to a flame.\n\nHouses stand in varying states of decay and splendor. Some meant for single souls, others stacked like cargo containers, full of bodies pressed together in their separate solitudes. He remembers when he knew his neighbors, when children played in streets that now stand empty save for the occasional passing car. He remembers the girl next door, her face now lost to time, their laughter echoing across summers that exist only in memory. But that world is gone now, replaced by this new reality where strangers pass each other without a glance, each locked in their own private apocalypse.",
            "She looked out at the endless fields and asked where everything was. I told her this was all of it knowing full well how the emptiness would strike her. She'd come from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home and had never known such vastness. The corn stretched out like a dead sea meeting the horizon and I told her what it was to grow up in these parts of Ohio and she knew me then as she hadnt before.\n\nThe quarry water lay black and still beyond the two-lane road that led to where the houses stood. Brick and stucco dwellings each claiming their half acre of god's earth that folk tended like prayer. Come spring the flowers would rise up among the trees that changed their colors like ancient ceremonies. The driveways held German machines that caught the light like mirrors after the washing.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. Always outside. Always singing above his mower's drone like some strange prophet of the grass. Folk smiled at his ways but knew him for what he was. A doctor once. Now just an old man growing older, fading like evening light into the green he tended with his John Deere machine.\n\nOur house stood grey against the sky. Geese moved like pale ghosts across the yard while the terrier gave chase. The stream behind whispered its way to the quarry waters and bullfrogs called into the dusk. Sometimes a cow's moan carried over from the distant farms. Past the wooden bridge we'd built lay a world untouched. Trees and wildflowers and herbs that grew as they pleased. This was my childhood kingdom. We built fortresses in the trees and stalked through the undergrowth playing at hunters. There were always children then. Always someone to share in the dreaming.\n\nWinter came like judgment. The yard that was green turned to emptiness. Trees that had bloomed pink and purple stood naked and black against the gray sky. Snow would come in the night and transform everything. My sister's angels pressed into the white. Snowmen rose up like sentinels. We warred with packed snow, building walls of ice and branch to shelter our arsenal. In that frozen realm we played at life while life played at us, unknowing and uncaring of what lay ahead. We were children still. That was all we knew to be."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "Here in the heartland where the farms give way to tourist towns there aint no malls nor chain stores nor restaurants with neon signs. Just empty roads stretching out between places. But the water surrounds us like some ancient guardian. Lake Michigan vast and cold to one side and Lake Charlevoix to the other, their waters pure and deep as time itself. Beaches everywhere you might care to walk.\n\nThe houses stand apart from one another like old sentinels. No matching facades here. Each one bearing the marks of years lived and worked, some renewed by careful hands, others wearing their age like medals. Their foundations rise from the earth, visible from the street, dark mouths gaping at passersby. Aluminum siding in every shade God gave permission for, weathered by countless seasons. Yards spread out wide and green where children's dreams take shape in trampolines and wooden towers. Gardens push up through black soil and wire fences pen in creatures both domestic and loved.\n\nThese are the homes of working folk. People who know the weight of a day's labor and the sound of children's feet on wooden stairs. You'll see them out there, the young ones running wild in the street, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs walking their masters, bikes spinning silent wheels. Neighbors know each other here. They can smell a stranger like wolves can smell fear. Someone's always got meat on the fire, smoke rising in thin blue columns against the sky. Folk wave and nod, knowing smiles passed like currency.\n\nThe grass stays cut and neat, no dead leaves permitted to gather and rot. Everything trimmed and ordered, not from pride but from respect for what's been built here. It aint beautiful in the way that rich folk measure beauty, but it's got something better. Something true. Something that whispers home and safety in the language of ordinary hearts.\n\nThe sheriff's office squats nearby, and the jail beside it like its darker brother. Health department too, all of them within walking distance. The recycling center hums with the business of waste and renewal. Baseball fields echo with tinny voices calling out americana through crackling speakers. Small planes drone overhead like mechanical dragonflies, taking off and landing at the town airport that ain't much more than a strip of concrete.\n\nIce cream can be had by foot, and downtown aint far if you've got the will to walk it. Children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through the heart of what we've built here. It ain't much, measured against the grand scales of cities. But it's something real. Something that endures.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels in their ordered rows, each one a mirror of its neighbor, all of them bound by the invisible chains of the homeowners association that ruled here. Not a blade of grass grew wrong. Not a stone lay crooked in the decorative beds. The driveways ran short and clean to the two-car garages that gaped like standardized wounds in the faces of the homes.\n\nThey'd laid fresh concrete on the roads. Black and perfect. No rupture or crack to mar the surface. No history written there. Single story houses mostly though some rose higher, reaching up as if to touch the empty sky. No mailboxes stood at attention before the homes like in other places. Instead they'd gathered them in clusters at the street ends, metal and gleaming, requiring keys like prison cells.\n\nThe neighborhood lay at the edge of things, where civilization met the wild lands that still remembered what came before. Swimming pools stood behind gates, their waters blue and cold and dead. Walking trails wound through the spaces between, worn smooth by the passing of countless feet. Old folk mostly dwelt here, their time spent watching from windows, guarding what remained of their ordered world. Some younger ones too, but fewer, as if the place preferred its inhabitants gray and quiet.\n\nThe city spread beyond, vast in its way but carrying still some remnant of smaller days. One mall stood like a monument to commerce, neither grand nor mean, serving its purpose without ceremony. Fifteen minutes drive through the gathering sprawl would take you to the merchants. They had everything there. Places where the wealthy could buy their clean food, places where the poor could stretch their dollars thin. All of it waiting just beyond the horizon of houses.\n\nThis was a safe place. A clean place. A place where people watched out for their own though they knew not why. The pools lay waiting. The trails wound on. And all of it held together by rules and order and the fear of what chaos might come should the center not hold.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the disappeared. Strange thing to hear of such matters in a district where folk paid thousand-dollar tithes each month just to lay their heads. None I knew had heard these tales neither. Mayhap its the weight of living crushing down. Known some who weep in the nighttime hours when the darkness comes. Things dear now, dearer than before, but we learned the way of less. Come to know the smell of dead mens clothes and broken toys, dust-covered and waiting. The nose grows dull with age. Some take to smoke. Some just forget what clean air tastes like.\n\nThe fleamarket persists like some ancient thing. Smells like magazines yellowed with time stacked on dead pianos. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned. Three houses of the discarded within walking distance. Start at the far end, you can make your way through charity shops, library stacks, rare books and curiosities. Downtown packed tight with metal and flesh, morning crowds moving like water but the thrift stores stay quiet as tombs. Good place to lose yourself when the hours stretch long.\n\nEvery year brings more. They say its growing, this city. Home to some great digital empire dealing in wants and needs, still stretching its skin like some young beast. Makes me think on New York. Everyone carrying their own weight, asking nothing. Can keep to yourself here, quiet-like, and none will disturb your peace. Not like down South where concern means care. Here you keep your walls up long as you please and the city just rolls past like dark water.\n\nLife moves through it though. Got a piano player next door, singers up above. Less strangers now, more like kin. We gather when needs must, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Found some fortune here maybe. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Keep clean, share food, pass letters back and forth. Good to see them, think they feel the same about me. Living in this great concrete maze but its the people make it feel like home instead of damnation.",
            "The town lies just beyond the reach of the city, a small midwestern place where the edges blur into cornfields and forgotten lots. We live on the east side where the houses stand weathered and gray, paint peeling like old scabs, where folks make do with less than most. Not an ugly place though. People still nod and speak when you pass, their eyes carrying something like hope or maybe just resignation.\n\nThe violence comes and goes like weather. Gunshots sometimes in the night, far off or close, you cant always tell. The neighbors boy got killed outside the tavern last summer. Just another soul gone to whatever waits in the dark. Sometimes things disappear from porches. Small things. Things folks forget to bring inside when night comes.\n\nThe poison that's killing these people aint natural. Fentanyl they call it. It moves through the streets like a ghost taking whoever it wants. The town tries to fight it with clinics and meetings where they teach people how to bring back the dead. Sometimes it works. Mostly it dont.\n\nThe boy goes to school where they feed all the children because hunger dont care about pride. Good people there. They watch over him like he was their own despite whatever's different about him. He comes home happy most days. The school has gatherings where families come together like they used to in the old days, before everything got broken.\n\nThe city men fix up the streets and parks where the money folks live and shop, on the west side where everything shines a little brighter. Our side stays dark. That's just how it is and how it's always been. Been here sixteen years now. The house aint much but it keeps out the rain and holds whatever warmth we can gather. This is our place. Whatever that means. Whatever that's worth.",
            "The neighborhood sits atop the hill like some ancient god's throne, buildings old as sin rising up from streets that remember. Seven stories up I watch the theater across the way, its facade weathered and knowing. Down the hill there's a place where folk gather when the warmth comes, lined up like penitents before some neon shrine, the arcade machines within humming their electric psalms into the night air.\n\nThe park sprawls vast and grey above it all, ringed in concrete and steps that rise like the ribs of some fallen beast. Winter brings the dispossessed, their tents arrayed in desperate geometry against the cold. Rain comes biblical and merciless, driving them closer together for what meager warmth bodies can share. They cluster near the family center where steam rises from showers like prayers unanswered.\n\nBut it aint the architecture that makes this place. Aint the proud bones of buildings nor the hills that roll down toward the sea like waves frozen in time. Its the people carrying their stories like scars. Hilltop they called it, bloodiest corner of the western world once. Federal men came through like locusts, DEA badges glinting like false stars. The people remember. Stories pass like dark wine from lip to lip, generation to generation, seeping into transplants like me till we taste the bitter truth of it.\n\nThey tell white folk to stay clear after dark, words carrying the rust of old fears. Maybe its that my skin carries just enough shadow to pass, or maybe the Hill knows its own. Knows them that understand how fear and ignorance breed in the dark corners of a nation that calls itself enlightened.\n\nThe streets know me now. Known me through nights when strangers offered warmth instead of harm. Known me in the laundromat woman's mercy, letting me shelter when the rain came biblical. Known me huddled invisible against storefronts grey as tomb walls, till some passing soul stopped to press paper money in my hand and speak of beauty and worth like some street corner prophet.\n\nThis is my place now. These streets. These people. This hill that rises like truth above the city, bearing its weight of memory and hope into the gunmetal sky.",
            "I came to this place in the late summer before eighth grade commenced, the houses standing like sentinels in the fading light. Two boys lived nearby then, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, though they're gone now, scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. But the memories remain. Most folk who dwelled here when I first arrived still do, their lives as constant as the seasons.\n\nThe neighborhood stretches out like any American dream, two-story houses lined up like soldiers at attention. Weekend sounds of children playing drift through the air when the weather turns warm, their voices carrying across empty streets. Quiet rules most days, silence broken only by the occasional passing car or distant lawnmower. Never had no trouble with the people here. They mind their business less you need something, like some unspoken covenant between strangers sharing the same patch of earth.\n\nPackages come and go, untouched on porches like offerings to modern gods. Trust flows easy here, like water in a stream. There's a park nearby, not more than a minute's walk through the trees. Basketball hoops stand sentinel over cracked concrete where we played our games, football too, and baseball when the weather was right. Got my nose broke there once, caught an elbow in a game gone wrong, but the good memories outweigh the bad like gold outweighs lead.\n\nThese days I take my cousin's young ones there, watch them swing and slide like I once did, their joy pure as spring water. The park calls to something deep inside me now, something old and true. The neighborhood's got everything a body could want. Food from all corners of the earth within walking distance - Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Italian - though most folks now let others bring it to their door through glowing screens and digital prayers.\n\nFast food joints stand on every corner like churches of convenience, and pizza places too, more than you could count. Stores line the streets selling everything from medicine to memories. Two pharmacies face each other across the road like old rivals, a grocery store squats nearby, and there's even a place run by Indian folk where you can find spices that smell like dreams of far-off lands.\n\nSometimes when I read about other neighborhoods, about the darkness that dwells in some places, I know I've been blessed. This place ain't perfect, nothing is in this world, but it's mine and I reckon that's enough.",
            "The college stands near where I live, a blessing or curse depending on the day. Apartment buildings rise like concrete monoliths against a godless sky, their facades weathered and old as sin itself. Between them crouch the bars and eateries where students gather like pilgrims at some forsaken shrine. The new bar they renamed stands prouder than the rest, demanding more coin for the same spirits that flow through all vessels.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes - the young scholars and the poor souls trapped by circumstance in these cheap dwellings. Children too, countless small figures moving in packs near the elementary school that squats at the edge of sight. My neighbors remain strangers and that's how it shall stay, though their constant burning of the devil's weed forced management to mount some plastic contraption that spews artificial freshness into the stale hallway. A joke told in plastic and chemicals.\n\nNew buildings rise down the street, false prophets built of cardboard and promises, charging gold for quarters made of straw. The cheap diner serves its meals on paper like some dystopian soup kitchen, microwaving sustenance for the masses. The gas station stands sentinel, a place where hope goes to die on minimum wage.\n\nThe city's money brought new concrete and grass, as if nature could be purchased and planted like fence posts. Trees shadow my building, their stumps testament to those already fallen. Behind lies 43rd street, a darker reflection of our own, where broken sidewalks tell tales of neglect and crime breeds in the shadows of shabby buildings hidden behind green curtains of leaves.\n\nYet I remain, for the price suits my purse and the university lies within walking distance. The buses come and go like mechanical pilgrims, carrying their human cargo to stores and downtown streets. This is my station now, this purgatory of students and survivors, of concrete and leaves, of hope and decay all mixed together like ash in the wind.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the failing light, white porches stark against the metal roofs green as cedar water. A cul-de-sac where folk gather in the graying dusk, speaking low words that carry on the evening air while young ones mark the concrete with colored chalk or chase their kites against the dimming sky. Like some forgotten time returned. Some ancient memory of how things was.\n\nFields stretch beyond where we stand, trees rising up black against blue skies scattered with clouds white as bone. But the weather turns cruel here. Last night the sirens came wailing through the dark like some mechanical banshee and folk scattered to their holes. Found myself crouched in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever vestments of civilization seemed worth saving while the big dog prowled the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. The hail came then. Like God's own knuckles rapping judgment on the roof.\n\nWhen it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing in the sudden cold, temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five like a stone dropped in deep water. The hail melted where it struck the blacktop still holding the day's heat. Then the sun broke through and the rain came again and there above it all hung twin rainbows like some celestial gateway. Took pictures quick as I could though nothing captured in a box could hold such glory.\n\nThe streets stayed quiet a while longer, folk emerging slow like survivors of some great catastrophe, then life returned as it always does. Women and children gathering while supper cooked in their ovens, talk drifting on the cooling air. Different here from New Hampshire, the voices soft and stretched like warm taffy in the southern way.\n\nBehind the houses lies a field where deer pass silent as smoke and beyond that a pond where no one swims. Mornings the bullfrog sings his ancient song like something left over from the time before time. Forty minutes from Charlotte but it might as well be another world entire. Roosters call across the dawn from hidden farms and in the evening a donkey brays his lonesome song into the gathering dark. Found this place like finding some artifact of older days, some remnant of what the world was before the world forgot itself.",
            "Ten years in this place. Time dont care none for memories but they come anyway. First time we come up from Riverdale to Stockbridge I wept like a child though I was one then. Mama and daddy said it was for the better. Better schools. Better houses. Better everything they said. No more ghetto they said. Words dont make a home but time does.\n\nYears passed like wind through dead grass. Made friends. Made enemies too. Neighbors stayed strangers except for Mr Glen and Dennis living next door. Good folk. Almost like blood how close we got. Remember Mr Glen's wedding clear as yesterday. Him getting hitched again. Whole family went. Mama daddy sister and me watching them dance. Ms Veda in her white dress throwing that little leg strap. Caught it in my hands like a sign. Didnt catch no flowers though. Danced with Marsharii that night. Aint seen her since. Time takes everything.\n\nNeighborhood's like some maze God laid down. Got GPS now but back then just wandered. Went far as I dared with Kason and Curtis. Playing them games. Living like time would never end. Sometimes I go to the park now. Just to be. Just to breathe. Take them sticks from Home Depot. Practice balance like some old warrior monk. Bring my wooden sword too sometimes. Tennis courts and basketball hoops standing empty like grave markers. Aint played in years. Daddy and Mr Graves taught us tennis when we was young. Worked us hard in that summer heat but we smiled through it.\n\nMemory's a kind of cage. Holds all them good times. All them stories. But the best ones aint been lived yet. They're out there waiting in the dark like wolves. Waiting for their time to come.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, settled deep in South Carolina's flesh where the peach trees stood sentinel over the quiet fields. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World the sign declared, weather-worn and proud in its proclamation, though the words meant little now to the scattered souls who dwelled there.\n\nFields stretched out beyond sight, broken only by metal-roofed houses that squatted far back from the road like wary creatures. The buildings rose two stories tall, some wearing gray shingles that had seen better days, others gleaming metallic against the merciless southern sun that beat down day after day without cease.\n\nIn the heart of it all stood a single stoplight, swaying gentle above the crossroads like some mechanical prophet. Round it clustered the few merchants who remained. Hong Kong, where a single family toiled in silence. Fiesta, where Mexican dreams were served on chipped plates. Gary's, with its burgers that tasted of times past. The pizzeria was gone now, nothing but an empty shell and memories of better days.\n\nMaxwell and Halford's still poured cherry cola like blood into paper cups, and the IGA stood proud but costly, its aisles walked mostly by those too desperate or too tired to make the pilgrimage to Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville. Dollar General thrived like a weed in barren soil, its parking lot never empty, its fluorescent lights burning from dawn till dusk.\n\nThe furniture store, Possibilities, sat squat and determined, its owner's kindness legendary among the townsfolk. Next door, Clark's tended to the animals, washing and cleaning God's creatures with careful hands. The doctors, both for man and beast, kept their distance from town center, as if afraid to witness its slow decay.\n\nOne school remained, Johnston Elementary, standing alone like the last tooth in an old man's mouth. After fifth grade the children vanished to other towns, as if drawn away by some invisible tide. They spoke of parks to come, two and a half acres of hope they said would bring new life. But for now the town slept, quiet and still, so small you might pass through it between heartbeats and never know it was there at all.",
            "The street runs between two highways cutting through Tennessee like twin serpents of black asphalt, bearing their endless procession of machines. More traffic than a man might want but the neighborhood stays quiet enough. Folk dont move much here. They come and they stay or they never come at all. You see them working their yards in the morning light, mechanical beasts chewing down the grass from March till October when the growing finally gives out. We got us a house on the corner. Me and the woman and two girls, eleven and fourteen. We watch them all come and go, know their vehicles like we know our own faces. When something strange rolls through we mark it. \n\nIn winter the children take to sledding down the hill on the side street, their voices carrying thin and cold in the gray air. But winter dont come much anymore. Just a long fall that stretches out like a dying man. The trees stand thick here, remnants of what was before. They drop their leaves in drifts come autumn and we burn them in piles that send sweet smoke into the cooling air. The neighborhood filled with shade and shadow, filtered sunlight making patterns on the ground like old lace.\n\nWe work from the house mostly. Stay close to home. Sometimes we'll cook out back, meat dripping fat onto hot coals, smoke rising up past the deck boards like prayers. The garage sits back behind the house and we dont use the front door much except when strangers come calling, which they rarely do. I work on my truck there sometimes, doors standing open to the street, listening to the sounds of living filter in. Children on their bikes. Dogs and their people walking slow in the evening light.\n\nHolidays bring the outsiders. Thanksgiving sees strange cars lining the streets like funeral mourners, Christmas the same. Mother's Day too. But mostly its just us here, going about our business in this place we've made our own. If it werent for them highways bracketing us like prison walls, it might be perfect. But perfect aint in the nature of things. Never was.",
            "The desert stretches out endless and brown, nothing but dirt far as the eye can see. Been here since the 90s when houses stood like lonely sentinels in the waste, scattered wide across the emptiness. Different now. The city grows like some manner of concrete vine, spreading its tendrils through what was once open country. Still got space though. Still got that emptiness that makes a man feel small.\n\nOld folk live round here mostly. Decent people. Keep to themselves but wave when you pass. Chain stores dot the landscape like tumbleweeds - Food for Less, Smart and Final. Aint no fancy stores. Have to drive far for them luxuries. Construction crews work endless, building tomorrow's sprawl. Sound of hammers and saws echo across the flats. Sometimes I watch them from my jobsite where I hang drywall and fit metal frames into endless ceilings, wondering how long before the desert disappears completely.\n\nThe wildlife though. That's what keeps a body sane out here. Desert creatures moving through their ancient rituals, paying no mind to the human world growing round them. My young ones spend their days chasing lizards and hunting bugs in the dust, same as children have done since time was young. They understand something pure in that pursuit that grown folks forget.\n\nCounty fair comes through regular. Brings lights and noise and people. Up in Wrightwood the mountains wear snow like a shroud. Down here in the museum they keep pieces of what was - old bones, Indian things, artifacts from when this place was young. Tells the story of how we came to be here, though sometimes I reckon the desert remembers different. Sometimes in the quiet you can hear it speaking its own truth, waiting patient as stone for us all to pass and be forgotten.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland, buildings rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. He reckons it different from what others might call neighborhood. No picket fences here. No children's bicycles abandoned in driveways. Just dormitories and apartments standing sentinel in the gray morning light, their windows dead and watching.\n\nThe buildings themselves come in three forms, each hosting their own breed of dweller. The apartments stand two stories tall, their weathered faces home to twenty souls or thereabouts, packed in like cattle in their narrow rooms. Then there's the houses, old structures scattered about like dice thrown by some careless god, where the alumni make their home. But it's the dormitories that dominate this concrete kingdom, great rectangular monuments stretching toward a colorless sky, hundreds of students stacked one atop the other in rooms barely big enough to hold their dreams.\n\nThe people here are legion, drawn from every corner of the earth like pilgrims to some secular Mecca. Professional staff occupy the houses like minor nobility, while the young ones, fresh-faced and raw, huddle in their dormitory cells. The older students claim the apartments, marking their territory like wolves grown wise to the ways of the pack.\n\nStores dot the landscape like oases in this academic desert. Food joints hawk their wares alongside clothing shops bearing the institution's mark like some tribal totem. A single park exists, a patch of green amid the gray, kept pristine by some unspoken covenant among the inhabitants. Here they gather, these disparate souls, united in their temporary exile from the world beyond.\n\nAt night the buildings loom darker still, their lit windows like dying stars in a manufactured sky. The campus sleeps fitfully, dreaming dreams of purpose and belonging in this strange colony they've built for themselves, this place that is neither home nor foreign land but something in between, something without name or precedent in the world that was.",
            "Ain't no sidewalks here. The world tilts downward like God himself set it at an angle, our house perched atop what folks call the workout hill on account of them joggers who grunt their way up its spine each morning like pilgrims seeking salvation. People walk the road itself, broken and pitted like the face of some ancient beast. Above them the power lines hang like black rosaries strung between weathered crosses, patched and mended where storms have torn them down time and again.\n\nThe evergreens stand tall and dark against the sky but folk here hate them with a fury reserved for old enemies. They cut them down with machines that scream into the mist, clearing views to the water below. Houses rise up the hillside like great glass-eyed creatures, each one straining above the other to see the bay. At sunset the water burns like molten copper beneath clouds that hang low and gray as widow's veils most days.\n\nThe damp here is a living thing. Moss creeps across every surface like some slow green plague. Left my truck standing a month and found it claimed by that verdant death, took hours to scrape the ghost of it away. No children here save the ones at the schoolhouse down the road. Instead dogs roam like primitive spirits, silent and watching. Found one in my house once, standing there like it owned the place, its eyes yellow in the gloom.\n\nRabbits move through the streets like shadows. Big ones that the gardeners curse and my cats hunt with a terrible patience. Birds too. Little ones that dart quick as thoughts and sometimes the great dark wings of hawks and eagles until the crows drive them off like small black devils protecting their territory.\n\nDown the hill where the land gives way to water there's places that serve up what the bay provides. No beach there but rocks dark as coal that we throw into the gray waters. The far shore stands like a wall through the eternal mist, close enough to mock us with its presence but too far to reach.",
            "He'd tell you Bensonhurst aint hard to find. The trains and buses run there like veins in a dying man's arm, same as they do all over this concrete maze they call New York. Urban and cold and gray but still breathing. Still alive.\n\nThe streets speak Chinese now. Korean too. Twenty years done changed everything. Every block got its Asian stores like teeth in a crooked smile. Supermarkets and laundromats mostly. The locals, they dont mind. Good food cheap and clean clothes, thats what keeps a neighborhood breathing. Where he lived there was four markets within spitting distance. But it wasnt all Asian folk neither. Place was mixed up like spilled paint, immigrants and their american born young ones all living in the same concrete shadow.\n\nThe park they fixed up stood like an oasis in all that stone. Basketball courts lined up like soldiers. Soccer field stretched out dead and brown. Handball walls wearing their history in scuff marks. Children's swings hanging like gallows in the wind. Summer days the water fountain ran like tears while the children played beneath it. All kinds playing together like the world aint taught em to hate yet.\n\nNo towers here. Just boxes stacked for living. Coops and condos but mostly two family houses lined up and down the streets like grave markers. The people were kind enough but lord the noise. Cars screaming past at all hours, music bleeding through walls, engines roaring like wounded beasts in the dark morning.\n\nNight time was different. Night time you kept your eyes moving. Neighborhood was safe enough they said but evil lurks in men's hearts everywhere. He'd been beaten here once, years back. These days thieves took packages right off porches bold as brass. And dog shit everywhere you stepped, like the rules of men meant nothing to these people. City said clean it up but nobody listened. Nobody ever did.\n\nHe'd seen it all change. Seen it die and be reborn. The streets remembered everything even if the people tried to forget.",
            "You got to understand Portland first. What it means to be weird there. Up on that old building that serves everything from pizza to flesh shows, breaking half the laws God ever wrote, there's words painted saying Keep Portland Weird. Some folk say it's a prayer for old times, when the city was cheaper and stranger and bred things that had no name. Others hear it like a calling, like come here and we'll call you weird but mean it kind like a blessing.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their glass towers reaching up into that gray sky but Portland stays weird all the same. Not that weird means kind exactly. Just means tolerating what other places won't abide. We got our modern troubles same as anywhere. Chinese goods in every store. Normal things too like yoga women and men in suits but somehow it all rides lighter here.\n\nIn my part they paint houses like fever dreams. Gardens growing wild right up through the concrete. And them free boxes. Lord the free boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass. Clothes and books mainly but could be anything. Magic in them sometimes. Perfect thing just waiting there for the right soul to find it. That's Portland to me anyway. But I'm just one kind of strange in this strange land.\n\nSome wouldn't touch them sidewalk treasures. They do their bending with goats instead or scream at men kicking balls in rain-soaked fields. Dreams live here. Or maybe just the dreaming of dreams while the beer flows dark and endless. We got our darkness too. Drugs and broken minds beneath them endless clouds. The rain just keeps coming.\n\nThe homeless gather here like birds to seed, drawn by what little mercy we can spare. More than most places offer but never enough. Never enough. The rest of us toggle between pity and hate, same as anywhere else. In that we ain't weird at all. Just human in our failings. Just lost in our own particular way.",
            "The mountains stood there always. North. Like ancient gods bearing witness to the sun's coming and going, day after weary day. A man could forget them in the mundane turns of life but they remained, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of men. And when the weight of living pressed hardest they'd call out silent and demanding to be seen and a man could turn to them and draw from their strength like water from some deep and ageless well. He'd come here first as a boy hardly grown, to the university that sat in their shadow, and they'd claimed him then and there. The campus had its charms sure enough. Fine buildings and trees and ponds that could steal a piece of a man's heart but the mountains they ruled over all like some old testament deity surveying its domain.\n\nThe town spread out below them pretty enough in its way. Coffee houses where young scholars burned midnight oil and filled themselves with bitter drink to ward off sleep. Downtown not far, reachable by foot or by bus, where old brick buildings stood shoulder to shoulder like tired soldiers, their colors faded by time and weather. Here the town showed its other face, citified and bustling, but it didn't last. Past the library the quiet came back like a tide, washing away the noise and the hurry.\n\nThe place held memories like a cup holds water. Good ones and bad ones both. He'd walked past them rusted swings with friends when dawn was breaking after nights spent awake with books and papers. Run through crowded streets to catch pictures at that fancy theater where the university gave out tickets free. But the ponds, they'd seen darker times. Two AM crying jags when existence itself seemed more weight than a soul could bear. He'd watched the turtles and the ducks going about their business, each one knowing its place in the order of things while he searched his own heart for purpose like a man searching a dark room for something lost.\n\nSo he walked. Past pond and park and houses all neat and proper in their suburban rows until he came to the main road. The sun was coming up then, laying its gold across the palm trees, painting the sky in colors that had no names. He was walking north without knowing it and there they were. Always there. The mountains rose up past every building man had raised, touching that yellow-blue dawn sky like something holy. They spoke without words into his heart and gave him the strength to go on.",
            "You wouldnt see it first passing. Just houses behind the stores. Not the kind folks choose willing but the kind they end up in when there aint nowhere else to go. Past the dead Whole Foods and them hotels that stand empty save summer reunions theres a whole world breathing. Streets lined with apartment buildings like great concrete beasts laid down careful beside each other, sleeping. First ones got trouble written in the papers but we wont speak on that. Truth aint always what gets told.\n\nNext buildings over different though. Different world entire. College across the way. Small campus. Quiet. Students drift in early morning with their coffee cups like ghosts. Iron gates screech their welcome while cars stack up behind, drivers cursing the slow parade of learning.\n\nRoad ends at another. Park on one side. Healing place on the other where broken folk try to mend. Got chairs out front and a fan that just turns and turns in the thick air like it's stirring soup. Children run wild in the park grass, spinning like drunk angels while bees work the flowers dont care about nothing but their business. Old folk walking dogs eye the skateboard kids like they're studying sin itself. Girls bunch up by the swings talking about boys and whatever lights up their phones these days.\n\nStrip mall sits watching it all. Sushi place never full but keeps on. Swimming store. Place for painting nails. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Feed yourself. Fill your pool. Fix your hands. Got one of them yogurt places too where you serve yourself like playing God with toppings. Kids from the park go there. Stand around with their cups sweating in the heat while they blow smoke and try to look like something they aint yet.\n\nThis here's a piece of the old south. Time moves different here. Like molasses in winter. Some things dont need changing. Some things just need leaving be.",
            "The houses stood like sentinels of a forgotten time. Some whole and some split asunder yet joined still like conjoined twins in the gray light of morning. Small patches of earth they called yards lay before each dwelling and narrow strips of concrete for the automobiles that came and went like mechanical ghosts. They were remnants of some older dream. The American dream they'd called it. It had took hold of the people once but now it was letting go slow and quiet like a dying man's grip.\n\nThe neighborhood persisted. It called out still to those who passed through. Called out in a voice that grew weaker with each season. Folk didn't carry the light in their eyes no more and the yards grew wild where once they'd been kept neat as Sunday clothes. But automobiles still squatted in every drive and the young ones played in the street like there wasnt nothing in the world beyond the block they stood on.\n\nThe school building rose up like some ancient temple. Ninety years it had stood. Ninety years of children passing through its halls dreaming dreams that mostly died before they got born. Churches stood empty now save for dust and memories but the basketball courts rang with life. Each house different from the next yet carrying the same weight of years.\n\nThe market belonged to the Yemen folk. Only Arab family for miles. Most everyone else carried African blood. Wide streets where children played at football and scattered like quail when cars came through. Old folk who'd been there since forever told tales of times when every soul knew every other soul by name.\n\nWhere the karate school had been there was now a pharmacy. Seems folk had decided chemical comfort was worth more than knowing how to fight. The picture show still ran old films at cut rate prices. Young ones stayed away like it carried plague but the elders came regular. Called it a bargain.\n\nThe expressway passed through but didn't stop. Young ones wanted an exit ramp but the elders knew better. Knew that kind of progress was really just decay wearing a fancy suit. New school going up now. They were fixing to pick some kind of mascot. Someone said a cyborg in a log cabin. Like trying to marry tomorrow to yesterday. But maybe that's what the whole place was doing anyway.",
            "The city stretches endless and gray before him, a maze of concrete and steel rising up like the bones of some ancient beast. He watches from his window. Buildings scattered without purpose or meaning between the storefronts and offices that stand like tombstones in the failing light. Restaurants and shops line the streets like desperate mourners, some bearing the marks of corporate ownership while others stand alone, defiant in their independence. The streets wind through it all like dried riverbeds.\n\nParks dot the landscape, small patches of green amid the waste where children still play, their laughter a strange echo in this concrete valley. The people here exist in tribes, each claiming their territory in the urban expanse. The rainbow folk. The orthodox with their black coats and ancient ways. The Russians who fled their homeland carrying memories like stones in their pockets. And beyond, more tribes still. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. All of them separated by mere miles that stretch into hours in the grinding traffic that moves like cold molasses through the arteries of the city.\n\nNobody walks here anymore. They sit sealed in their metal coffins, crawling through the endless congestion, searching for spaces to abandon their vehicles in the vast parking lots that spread like cancer across the land. The city grows despite itself, new towers rising up daily, steel frames reaching toward a sun that rarely breaks through the smog. The old residents watch with dead eyes as more come, always more, drawn to this place like moths to a flame.\n\nHouses stand in varying states of decay and splendor. Some meant for single souls, others stacked like cargo containers, full of bodies pressed together in their separate solitudes. He remembers when he knew his neighbors, when children played in streets that now stand empty save for the occasional passing car. He remembers the girl next door, her face now lost to time, their laughter echoing across summers that exist only in memory. But that world is gone now, replaced by this new reality where strangers pass each other without a glance, each locked in their own private apocalypse.",
            "She looked out at the endless fields and asked where everything was. I told her this was all of it knowing full well how the emptiness would strike her. She'd come from a place where stores stood within arms reach of home and had never known such vastness. The corn stretched out like a dead sea meeting the horizon and I told her what it was to grow up in these parts of Ohio and she knew me then as she hadnt before.\n\nThe quarry water lay black and still beyond the two-lane road that led to where the houses stood. Brick and stucco dwellings each claiming their half acre of god's earth that folk tended like prayer. Come spring the flowers would rise up among the trees that changed their colors like ancient ceremonies. The driveways held German machines that caught the light like mirrors after the washing.\n\nThe Korean lived there too. Always outside. Always singing above his mower's drone like some strange prophet of the grass. Folk smiled at his ways but knew him for what he was. A doctor once. Now just an old man growing older, fading like evening light into the green he tended with his John Deere machine.\n\nOur house stood grey against the sky. Geese moved like pale ghosts across the yard while the terrier gave chase. The stream behind whispered its way to the quarry waters and bullfrogs called into the dusk. Sometimes a cow's moan carried over from the distant farms. Past the wooden bridge we'd built lay a world untouched. Trees and wildflowers and herbs that grew as they pleased. This was my childhood kingdom. We built fortresses in the trees and stalked through the undergrowth playing at hunters. There were always children then. Always someone to share in the dreaming.\n\nWinter came like judgment. The yard that was green turned to emptiness. Trees that had bloomed pink and purple stood naked and black against the gray sky. Snow would come in the night and transform everything. My sister's angels pressed into the white. Snowmen rose up like sentinels. We warred with packed snow, building walls of ice and branch to shelter our arsenal. In that frozen realm we played at life while life played at us, unknowing and uncaring of what lay ahead. We were children still. That was all we knew to be."
