            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This land aint got no towers of glass nor concrete fortresses they call malls. No Walmart. No Target. Just earth and water and sky stretched out like God himself laid it bare. Michigan they call it but that dont capture the truth of it. Two lakes hem us in like ancient sentinels. Lake Michigan to the west, vast and cold and gray, Lake Charlevoix to the east, both of them carrying secrets older than man.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old soldiers who've seen too much to crowd together. Each one different, each one bearing the marks of time and weather and the hands that built them. Basements dug deep into the earth, visible from the road like open wounds in the ground. Aluminum siding gone silver with age, colors faded but holding on, defiant against the elements.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs too, and people on wheels and feet, moving through the days like spirits. Neighbors know neighbors here. You can tell who belongs and who dont. The ground beneath is kept clean and green, no dead leaves left to rot, no grass grown wild. Not beautiful maybe, not like them magazines show, but something more important. Something real.\n\nWithin walking distance stands the sheriff's jail, gray and solemn as a headstone. The health department too, and the place where they sort through what people throw away. Baseball fields where voices cry out names into the evening air, the words carrying across empty spaces like prayers. Small planes growl overhead, metal birds casting shadows on the earth below.\n\nYou can walk to get ice cream here, real ice cream, not that stuff they sell in boxes in them big stores. Downtown aint far neither, if your legs'll carry you. Children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through streets that know their names. This here's a place where people can breathe, where they can live without looking over their shoulder every minute. It aint perfect maybe, but it's got something that them bigger places lost long ago. Something true.\n\nWe're surrounded by water here, like them old tales of paradise. Every which way you turn theres a beach waiting, water lapping at the shore like time itself trying to wear away at the edges of our world. This here's a place where a body can plant their feet and know they're standing on something real. Something that'll hold.",
            "He stood at the entrance to the development watching the sameness stretch out before him like some terrible vision of conformity made manifest in stucco and concrete. The homes stood in their rows, each yard a mirror of the last, grass cut to precise heights as if measured by some godless instrument. Small trees dotted the landscape at measured intervals, their shadows falling on decorative stone that had never known the touch of natural placement.\n\nThe homeowners association ruled here like some faceless authority from an age long past. Their presence hung in the air like a specter, manifest in the pristine driveways and the mechanical precision of every architectural choice. Two-car garages lined the streets like empty eyes staring out at nothing.\n\nThe roads lay perfect and unmarred, as if suffering itself had been outlawed here. No potholes marred the concrete, no imperfection dared show its face. At the end of each street stood clusters of mailboxes, metal sentinels requiring keys like some ritual of belonging. They'd banned the individual boxes, those small totems of personality, in favor of uniformity.\n\nThe neighborhood pressed against the city's edge where civilization met wilderness, though both had been tamed here. Community pools lay behind their gates like blue mirrors reflecting nothing but order. Walking trails wound through the manufactured wild, paths laid down for those seeking the illusion of nature's touch.\n\nThe retired folk who dwelt here kept watch from behind their windows, their presence a kind of sentinel against disorder. Young professionals moved among them like ghosts, all of them bound by invisible covenants to maintain this artificial peace.\n\nBeyond lay the city proper, its mall standing alone like some commercial monument to necessity. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to the stores, those temples of commerce where organic produce lay alongside discount goods in their separate kingdoms of plenty.\n\nHe thought about how they'd tamed even time here, how they'd stripped away the chaos of life and replaced it with something controllable. The sun set over the development the same as it had yesterday and would tomorrow, casting shadows across a place where even darkness had been negotiated into submission.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the missing. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more each month to inhabit. None I knew had heard such tales. Perhaps it's the weight of living pressing down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, the musty clothes and broken toys. The scents of childhood fade. Some take to tobacco, others just forget what clean air tastes like. But the flea market abides. The smell of growing old is magazines yellow with age atop a piano that won't sing no more. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned.\n\nThree thrift stores within walking. Start at the far end and you can work your way through charity shops, the library with its quiet rooms, rare books behind glass, curiosities in dusty cases. Downtown's full up with metal and flesh, morning til night, but in the thrift stores time stops. Silent as a tomb no matter the chaos outside. Good place to lose yourself. More folk coming every year now. Growing city, they say. Some big company dealing in packages and promises set up here. Like New York in its way. Everyone got their own purpose and none asks much of you. Can keep to yourself, quiet-like, and folk leave you be. Not like down South where concern means caring. Here you don't pry and the city rolls past like waves on dark shores.\n\nLife moves through it though. Got a piano player next door, singers up above. Less strangers than a kind of family. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Lucky maybe. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I got it. Carry their mail, they carry mine. Good to see them, think they feel the same. Living in this concrete maze might seem like damnation but these people, these neighbors of mine, make me think I ain't ruined everything just yet.",
            "The town lay just beyond the reach of the city's sprawl, a small heartland place where the east side bore the marks of harder times. Houses stood weathered and wanting, their values low as the winter sun, rented or owned by folk who knew the taste of empty cupboards. Not an ugly place though. Not that. Neighbors would nod and speak their mornings, their faces lined with stories untold.\n\nThe darkness came sometimes. Violence had marked its territory these past years. Gunshots had torn the night air not three blocks from where we slept. The neighbors boy, taken by lead and powder outside some barroom, his mother's tears still fresh in the soil. Our own losses measured smaller - trinkets gone missing from the porch, carried off like birds in the night.\n\nThe poison ran deep here, same as everywhere now. Fentanyl moving like a ghost through the streets, taking souls quick or slow. But there were those who fought it, teaching others how to pull the dying back from that far shore, running centers where the broken could seek mending.\n\nThe school stood like a beacon. My boy, different in his ways, found shelter there among teachers who saw past difference to the child within. No child went hungry inside those walls, breakfast and lunch free as air, no shame in empty pockets. Parents gathered there too, building something larger than themselves.\n\nThe town fathers poured money into the center streets and western reaches, where commerce flowed. Our side stayed forgotten, streets patched like old quilts, parks gone to seed. Some spoke against this but words dried up like rain on hot pavement.\n\nSixteen years we'd made our home here, in this house that weren't worth much but held us safe. The town had worked its way into our bones, become the ground we walked. Couldn't imagine calling anywhere else home now. Some places mark you that way, write themselves into your story until you can't tell where they end and you begin.",
            "The neighborhood perched high like some ancient sentinel, its bones made of history and mortar and the memories of dead men. Seven stories up I dwelled across from where the theater stood weathered and old, its marquee dark and peeling like the shed skin of something once alive. Down the hill there was a place where folk gathered when the nights grew warm, lined up like cattle waiting for slaughter but there wasnt any slaughter just games and drink and the crush of bodies seeking respite from the world outside.\n\nThe park lay a few blocks distant. Concrete wrapped round it like a noose, steps carved into its throat where the homeless made their camp in the wet season. They lined their tents in rows neat as headstones, huddled together against the rain that fell eternal in these parts. No snow came but the damp got in your bones just the same. They stayed close to where they could wash, where they could remember what it was to be human.\n\nThis place they called Hilltop had been blood ground once. Gang territory. Even now stories passed like scripture of federal men come to sweep clean what could never be cleaned. The people remembered. They always remembered. Tales passed down like family bibles, mother to child, stranger to stranger, about days when death walked these streets wearing colors and carrying steel.\n\nThey said whites shouldnt walk here after dark but that was old fear talking, ghosts of dead prejudice haunting these hills. Maybe it was my skin being just dark enough or maybe the Hill knew its own, knew who understood the weight of history and the stain of ignorance that still marked this supposed paradise of cultures mixed and mingled.\n\nThe streets knew me and I knew them. Id seen kindness here in the dark places where none should exist. Laundry women whod keep their doors open just a minute longer, strangers whod offer warmth against the cold. Id huddled invisible against storefronts in the gray nothing of night only to be seen, truly seen, by some passing soul whod press paper money in my hand and speak of worth and beauty like a prayer.\n\nThe Hill was home. Nothing else to it. Just home.",
            "I came here in the eighth grade of my youth, to a place that would shape the years ahead. The houses stood like sentinels, two stories tall, identical and watchful in their suburban uniformity. At first the loneliness was a thing that lived inside me but then there were two boys, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, though they're gone now, scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. But the memory of them remains, etched in the concrete and the quiet afternoons.\n\nThe neighborhood stands unchanged. Silent most days save for the sound of children's voices carrying on the warm air, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. The people here keep to themselves except in times of need, like creatures in a desert waiting for the rain. Trust lives here still. Packages appear and remain untouched on porches like offerings to some domestic god.\n\nThere's a park nearby, not more than a whisper away. The basketball court and the baseball diamond and the football field where blood once flowed from my nose after an elbow caught me wrong, the memory of it sharp and metallic like a copper penny on the tongue. Now I take my cousin's children there, watch them swing and slide in the dying light of day, their joy pure and uncontaminated by time. The park holds ghosts now, memories that drift through the chain link fences like ash on the wind.\n\nThe streets around us pulse with life and food from every corner of the world. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All of it brought to doors now by young men and women carrying plastic bags like modern day deliverers of sustenance. Fast food joints squat on corners like concrete toads, their neon signs bleeding into the night. The stores stand shoulder to shoulder offering everything a body might need. Walgreens. CVS. The Jewel-Osco where the midwest does its marketing. Even an Indian store where spices sit in glass jars like captured sunsets.\n\nI've seen the stories of neighborhood wars fought on glowing screens and heard tales of feuds that burn like eternal flames, and I know that what we have here is rare as gold and twice as precious. This place, these streets, these people - they are a tapestry woven of peace and quiet understanding. And in these times that's a thing worth holding onto with both hands.",
            "The college stands near where I live, close enough to walk. Apartment buildings rise up like dead sentinels, their windows dark and watching. Between them stand the bars and eating houses where students gather, spending what little money they have on watered drinks and microwaved sustenance. They renamed one of the bars recent. More costly now but the spirits flow just the same.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes. Students with their books and dreams and the poor folk who've always been here, dwelling in the cheap rooms above. Children too, many of them, drawn by the elementary school that squats behind chain link nearby. My neighbors I do not know. Would not want to. The sweet reek of their smoking seeps beneath doors while management fights a futile war with artificial freshness pumped through vents.\n\nOld buildings crowd together, their facades weathered and peeling like dead skin though some hide renewed interiors behind their decay. Down the road stand newer structures, false promises of luxury built quick and cheap, charging gold prices for cardboard walls. They know the students will come regardless. The restaurant across serves food on paper, everything heated in boxes that hum. The gas station beside it bears witness to tired workers moving through their days like ghosts.\n\nThe city put money in once. New concrete paths snake between fresh-planted grass but cannot hide what lies beneath. Trees crowd thick around my building, their brothers cut down to stumps that dot the earth like grave markers. Behind us lies 43rd Street, meaner than ours, its walkways broken and buildings lurking behind vegetation gone wild. Violence lives there sometimes, though it visits our side too, carried on night winds between the complexes.\n\nBut I stay. The price is right and the buses come regular, metal beetles carrying us to market and downtown. The university waits within walking distance, promising something better. Or at least different. Sometimes that's enough.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass before the drought takes it. They'd built them to look separate but they aint. Folk gather some evenings at the end of whatever drive suits them best, watching their young ones mark the concrete with colored chalk or send their kites up into whatever wind God provides. Like stepping back through time itself, he thought. A respite from the cold mechanical world that had taken hold of everything else.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up against skies so blue they hurt to look at. But the weather turns cruel sometimes. Last night the sirens came wailing through the darkness, their sound carrying death in it. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever treasures seemed worth saving while the big one paced the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. Hail came down like God's own judgment, covering the ground in white fury. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing its last, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five quick as a heart stops beating. The hail disappeared into the hot pavement like it never was. Then the sun broke through and the rain came with it, and there in the sky hung two rainbows like some ancient sign.\n\nNeighbors emerged slow and cautious from wherever they'd took shelter, and soon enough the mothers was back out watching their young ones while supper cooked inside. Strange music in their southern voices, different from the northern sounds I'd known before. The houses might look alike outside but inside they're as different as the souls that inhabit them. Some small as prison cells, some opening up like churches.\n\nBehind it all lies the big field and the pond where swimming aint allowed. Deer move through there like ghosts at dawn and dusk. The bullfrogs sing their morning prayers and roosters call from the surrounding farms like preachers calling sinners to worship. A donkey brays in the evening darkness, reminding us all that we aint alone in this world. Found this place like finding gold in river mud, forty minutes from the city but might as well be forty years from anywhere.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Time stretches long like a black road with no end. When we first come here from Riverdale to Stockbridge my eyes ran wet with salt and grief for them I'd left behind. Mama and daddy they wanted better for us. For me and the little sister both. Said the schools was better here. Said it wasnt like them other places where the devil's work gets done in broad daylight.\n\nYears pass like dead leaves in the wind. Made some friends. Made some enemies too. Didnt know many neighbors except old Glen and Dennis living right alongside us. Good people. Like blood kin almost. I member that time Glen got hitched again. The whole family went. Mama daddy sister and me. White dress and cake and dancing. That woman Veda she threw that white thing off her leg and somehow it found its way to my hands like it knew where to land. Didnt catch them flowers though. Danced with Marsharii that night. Aint seen her since. Sometimes I wonder where the wind carried her.\n\nThis place is like them old mazes where you cant see the way out. Got me one of them GPS things now though. Started exploring with Kason and Curtis. We was always playing them video games. Living like there wasnt no tomorrow. Sometimes I go down to that park. Something about it soothes what needs soothing inside. Take them sticks from the hardware store. Practice my balance like them old monks might've done. Sometimes bring my wooden sword too. Basketball court sits empty most days. Tennis court too. Daddy and Mr Graves taught us tennis when we was young. Worked us till we could hardly stand but we smiled through it all.\n\nReckon I've lived enough stories in this place to fill a book. But them memories I told about, they stick like burrs to wool. Sometimes I look out past the houses and trees and think maybe the best aint happened yet. Maybe it's out there waiting like a promise. Like something written in stone before the world was born.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, nestled in the heart of South Carolina where the peach trees stood sentinel over the land. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World emblazoned on a weathered sign that greeted those few who passed through. Fields stretched out beyond sight, dotted with cattle and orchards that had been there longer than any living soul could reckon.\n\nThe houses stood apart from one another like strangers at a wake. Metal roofs gleaming in the merciless summer sun, or gray shingles dulled by time and weather. Set back from the road they were, behind fields where beasts grazed and crops rose from the earth like prayers.\n\nIn the heart of it all hung a single stoplight, swaying gentle above a fourway crossing where what passed for commerce gathered. Hong Kong, run by a family whose story was written in their eyes. Fiesta. Gary's with its burgers. The pizzeria gone now, nothing but an empty shell and memories of better days. Maxwell and Halford's where they sold cherry cola that tasted like childhood. IGA where folk bought what they needed but not what they wanted, saving their dollars for the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, that concrete cathedral of commerce.\n\nDollar General stood like a beacon, drawing them in from sunup to sundown. Possibilities Furniture where a woman known to all sold pieces that would outlive their owners. Clark's where they tended to the animals. Doctor's office and veterinary both, small but necessary as breath itself.\n\nThe school stood alone, Johnston Elementary, sending its children away after fifth grade like young birds pushed from the nest. No parks yet, though they spoke of one. Two and a half acres of promise that might never come to pass.\n\nNo picture shows or bowling alleys or places where youth might gather. No grounds for walking dogs or sitting in the shade. Just the land and the peach trees and the cattle and the people who called it home. Small enough to miss in the blink of an eye, like a tear shed for something beautiful and forgotten.",
            "The street runs between two highways, a vein of asphalt carrying the lifeblood of commerce and strangers through what might otherwise be sanctuary. We abide here, my wife and daughters and I, watching from our corner perch like sentinels of some forgotten outpost. The girls are eleven and fourteen, still young enough to find wonder in the rain.\n\nThe neighborhood holds its own against time. Few move in, fewer leave. Each house keeps its stories close, yards tended with quiet dedication, the drone of mowers marking time from March till October when the grass finally yields to winter's approach. Ancient trees tower above, remnants of what was here before, their shadows stretching across lawns like dark fingers. Come autumn they shed their burden and the air fills with smoke from leaf fires, that ancient perfume of seasons changing.\n\nWe work from home, our house both shelter and prison, watching the parade of familiar vehicles pass. Any strange car draws eyes like a wolf among sheep. Children pedal their bikes in endless circles, dogs walk their masters in morning mist, and the whole world seems to turn on its own axis, separate from the chaos beyond our borders.\n\nThe garage stands sentinel at the back, its doors like eyes when opened, watching over the street where I work on my truck, hands black with grease and mind empty of everything save the task. The front door stays shut, unused, a relic of formality. Holidays bring strange cars and distant kin, metal and flesh both gleaming with newness, but they pass like storms, leaving the street to its own devices.\n\nWinter comes seldom now, as if the seasons themselves have lost their way. Autumn stretches endless, the trees holding their leaves longer each year, the sleds on our hill gathering dust. Were it not for the constant flow of traffic, this place might be perfect. But perfection died with the old world, and we make do with what remains.",
            "The land stretches out brown and endless, dirt upon dirt and more dirt still, like some biblical curse laid down in ancient times. They dont know, them that aint lived here, what it means to wake each morning to that vast brownness spreading out in all directions, how a patch of green lawn marks a man who'd empty his wallet just to see something grow. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart like sentinels in the waste but now they crowd closer, though still with space between like they fear touching. The city grows like some slow cancer eating at the edges of the desert but that's the way of all places now.\n\nGood folk and bad folk both walk these streets same as anywhere. Round my place its mostly old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind screen doors. The stores aint nothing special, just them chain places with their bright signs and empty promises. No fancy markets here. You want that kind of thing youll need to drive and drive far.\n\nThe builders they come like vultures to fresh kill. They see all this empty space and their eyes get bright with the possibilities of profit. Sometimes watching them I get a sick feeling deep in my gut knowing they'll fill it all someday. Left the big city to get away from all that. Now I work construction myself, hanging drywall and ceiling grids, watching the desert disappear one room at a time.\n\nBut the animals. They was here first and they stay on, living in the spaces between. Folk come here for different reasons but mainly for that stark terrible beauty of it all. The desert, she makes her own rules about what lives and what dies. The wildlife, they know these rules better than any man. My younguns, they spend their days chasing lizards and insects like some primitive hunters, learning the ways of this hard land same as the creatures they pursue.\n\nWe got our attractions sure enough. The county fair comes round once a year like some traveling carnival of normalcy. Folks can drive up to Wrightwood, see the snow on the mountains like God's own frosting. The museum stands testament to what was here before - bones and artifacts and remnants of peoples long gone to dust. But its the desert herself that holds the real story, written in sand and stone and the long silence of empty places.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland. Buildings old and gray rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. He reckons it different from what others might call neighborhood but it is his and he knows no other. The dormitory stands sentinel among lesser structures, its windows dark and watching. Within dwell the others. His people. His community such as it is.\n\nThree kinds of dwelling here in this stone and metal maze. The apartments first, stacked boxes of glass and steel where souls cluster two and four to a room, twenty or more to a building, all of them pressed together in their shared solitude. Then the houses proper, scattered few among the grounds like artifacts of some forgotten domestic age. Alumni dwelling there in twos and fours, hanging on to what was. Last the dormitories themselves. Great concrete hives where hundreds sleep and wake and dream their dreams of what's to come. Two to a cell mostly. Steel beds. Institutional walls. The fluorescent light falling cold and dead across empty halls at night.\n\nThey come from everywhere, these people. All colors, all tongues. The professional staff in their little houses at the margins, new students in the great concrete dormitories, the older ones in their apartment warrens. No words could capture the whole of them. Better to let them be what they are.\n\nThe stores stand in rows like tired soldiers. Places to eat, places to buy whatever they need to survive here in this manufactured world. A park too, though calling it that seems wrong somehow. Just a space they keep clean between the buildings where sometimes they gather, these disparate souls all thrown together in this place that is neither city nor town but something else entirely. Something unnamed.\n\nHe looks out across it all in the failing light. The buildings rising dark against the sky. The paths between them empty now save for a few wandering figures, their shadows long and thin in the evening sun. This is his neighborhood. His world. For better or worse, this is where he dwells.",
            "The road runs empty where I live, winding up past houses perched like watchful birds on the highest ground any man might find to build upon. No sidewalks here. Just broken asphalt and the long slope rising cruel and merciless before you, a thing joggers seek out in their endless circling of these streets. They come and go like wraiths in the morning fog. The power lines hang loose and patched, victims of countless storms that sweep in off the water bringing rain and destruction and leaving behind only silence and the sound of dripping eaves.\n\nThe evergreens stand dark against the sky but they wont stand long. Men here hate them with a hatred pure and cold as winter. They fall to saws and axes, their stumps pulled from the earth like rotting teeth to clear the view of water beyond. Houses rise up proud and gleaming with their walls of glass, each trying to outreach the other in their hunger for the bay below. When the sun sets the water burns orange and gold but most days theres nothing but gray. Gray sky. Gray water. Gray mist that shrouds it all in a veil thick as grief.\n\nThe moss claims everything here. It grows wild and unchecked, turning cars and rooftops into fuzzy green monuments to decay. Left my own vehicle sitting idle once and found it transformed, had to scrape three hours to find metal underneath all that green fur.\n\nNo children here to speak of though theres a school close by. Just old folk watching their days wind down slow as the tide. Dogs run loose and fearless, pushing through open doors like they own them. Found one in my living room once, staring at me with eyes that held no apology. The rabbits too have claimed this place for their own, great fat things that dig up gardens until the cats hunt them down. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds mostly, though sometimes a hawk or eagle cuts through the air until the crows drive it off with their black wings beating like war drums.\n\nDown by the water where the restaurants serve up whatever the sea gives them that day, theres nothing but rocks and more rocks. The bay sits narrow and still, the far shore always visible through the mist like some half-remembered dream of solid ground.",
            "Bensonhurst lay before him like some vast concrete labyrinth, a maze of weathered brownstone and tired brick stretching toward a colorless sky. The trains came and went like metal serpents, their bellies full of the restless souls who'd made this corner of Brooklyn their temporary hell or heaven. He'd seen it change, seen the old Italian facades give way to signs in languages he couldn't read, their characters strange and beautiful like some ancient calligraphy.\n\nThe Asians had come slowly at first then all at once, like water through a broken dam. Their stores stood now on every corner, bright and clean and foreign. Markets full of fruits he'd never known existed, their flesh strange and wonderful. Laundromats humming their endless cycles, steam rising like ghosts in the fluorescent light. The old residents watched it happen and said nothing, for the food was good and the prices fair and what more could a man want in these godless times.\n\nHe walked past four markets within two minutes, each one a mirror of the last, each one full of voices speaking in tongues he'd never learn. The neighborhood was a babel of sorts, generations of immigrants layered like geological strata, their children speaking in tongues both old and new.\n\nThe park stood renewed, a concrete paradise where children played at being children. Basketball courts stretched like a graveyard of dreams, the thump of rubber on asphalt a heartbeat in the urban silence. Water fountains sprayed their blessing in summer, baptizing the young ones who shrieked and ran through the artificial rain.\n\nAt night the streets changed their nature. Music thundered from passing cars like war drums, engines roared their defiance at the darkness. The weak were prey here, as they had always been. He remembered the fists, the hatred in strange eyes, the theft of small things left unguarded. Even the dogs left their mark, their waste like small brown monuments to man's indifference.\n\nHe watched it all from his window, this theater of humanity playing out its endless acts. The houses stood shoulder to shoulder like weary soldiers, two families to each, all of them dreaming their separate dreams of better days. This was Bensonhurst, neither heaven nor hell but somewhere in between, where the trains ran on time and the markets never closed and the night was full of sounds that might have been music or might have been screams.",
            "You got to understand what weird means in Portland Oregon. Aint no simple thing. Words painted up on some building downtown that serves pizza and liquor and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws nobody seems to mind about. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk remember the old days when the city was cheaper and stranger and filled with its own particular madness. Others come seeking sanctuary for their own peculiarities, drawn like moths to the dim glow of acceptance.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their ways. Steel and glass boxes rise up to house them but the weird persists like some stubborn weed in concrete. Aint the same as acceptance mind you. The weird just means we take in what others cast out. We got our modern contraptions same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere. Normal folk doing normal things but somehow less burdened by it all.\n\nIn my quarter of the city the houses stand painted in colors that'd shame a sunset. Gardens growing wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers pushing up through cracks in the earth like memories of some forgotten paradise. And there's them free boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass by. Books and clothes mainly but could be anything. Magic in them boxes. Real magic sometimes, if you believe in such things.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray and constant like God's own melancholy. Drives some folk to darkness, to needles and bottles and sleeping rough under bridges. City tries to help but help aint never enough. The ones with homes look on them that aint got none with mixed hearts. Love and hate wrestling in their chests like brother killing brother.\n\nSome folk do their goat yoga. Some wave flags for the soccer boys. Some dig through boxes on sidewalks looking for treasure. All of us weird in our own particular way, carrying our dreams like crosses, drowning them in beer when they get too heavy. Aint so different from anywhere else in that regard. Just less ashamed of it maybe. Less inclined to hide what we are.\n\nThe weird persists. Like cockroaches after fire. Like hope in a dead world. Like love in a heart turned to stone.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel. North they rise like ancient gods bearing witness to the coming and going of light, to the passing of all things mortal and fleeting. A man might forget them in the crush and grind of his days but they remain, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of flesh and bone. And when the weight of living bears down heavy as stone they command attention with their jagged truth, offering up some measure of strength to the weary soul that looks upon them. Not peace exactly but perhaps the promise of endurance.\n\nI came here first as a student. The mountains north of the campus grounds reached into me with hooks of granite and did not let go. The school itself had its share of glory in brick and mortar and leaf, each claiming its portion of memory, but the mountains ruled absolute. The town spread below them like a supplicant. Coffee houses where young scholars fought sleep and desperation with bitter drink and darker thoughts. The downtown streets paved in old brick the color of dried blood, restaurants and offices standing shoulder to shoulder like condemned men. Here the quiet town showed its hidden fever, its secret heart beating wild as any city, but this lasted only blocks before the library rose up to restore silence once more. The place lived split between two natures, as if it could not decide what manner of thing it wished to be.\n\nMemories lay scattered across it all like fallen leaves. Some sweet as summer wine, others bitter as ash. The rusted playground where we walked dawn-drunk and sleepless. The gaudy theater where we spent the university's money on dreams projected large as life. But there were darker times too, for such is the way of living. The ponds especially drew me in my despair, watching me weep in the small hours while ducks and turtles went about their business, each knowing its place in the order of things while I wandered lost. Many nights I walked past those waters, past the cookie-cutter houses with their neat yards, until I found myself on the main road. The sun would break then across the palm trees like God's own judgment, and looking up I'd see I'd been walking north all along. And there they stood as they had always stood, those mountains, their peaks cutting into the dawn sky like knives, speaking without voice of persistence, of carrying on. Of enduring.",
            "You wouldnt see it first off. Just houses behind them stores. Not the kind of place folks'd choose to lay their head. But go on past that dead Whole Foods building and them hotels that only fill when summer brings the families back like migrating birds and you'll find life there. Real life. Streets lined with apartment buildings set down like some giant child's blocks abandoned in the dirt. They stand there quiet. Watching.\n\nFirst ones you come to got darkness in em. Bad things happened there. We wont speak on it. But them others beyond, they different. Three buildings standing shoulder to shoulder like brothers in the gray morning light. Cross the way theres that college. Small thing. More like a thought of a college really. Students drift in through them iron gates with their coffee cups steaming. Gates scream on their hinges like dying things while cars stack up behind em. Drivers cursing the morning and the gates and the whole world probably.\n\nRoad ends at another. T-shaped like a crucified thing. Park on one side. Healing place on the other where broken folk go to mend. Got chairs out front. Fan spinning lazy circles in the thick summer air like it's stirring soup. Children tumble in the grass across the way. Rolling and spinning while bees drift drunk between the roadside flowers. Old folks walking dogs eye them skateboard kids like they was looking at something died. Same old folks tip their heads to them girls bunched up by the swing sets talking about boys and whatever comes on them screens they always looking at.\n\nGot this sushi place tucked in with the other shops. Cheap food. Empty most times. Swimming store beside it. Place for painting ladies' nails between em. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your fingers. Eat raw fish. Theres one of them frozen yogurt places too where you put whatever you want on top. Them skateboard kids always there with their cups sweating in the heat while they blow smoke from them electronic cigarettes thinking they something special.\n\nThis neighborhood. This piece of the south. Time dont touch it much. Like God looked down and decided to leave this one piece just as it was. Forgotten maybe. Or saved. Hard to say which.",
            "The houses stood quiet and watchful like old men waiting for death. Some split down the middle like conjoined twins torn asunder yet still sharing flesh and bone and blood. Small yards stretched before them, driveways running alongside like dried up creek beds. Reminders of some American dream that once was. That dream that took hold of folk like a fever and then let go just as quick. But these houses they endure. They call out still. Silent testimonies to what folk once believed.\n\nThe people aint what they was. Yards gone wild and hope stretched thin as spiderweb but automobiles still mark each drive like grave markers. Children play in the streets like there aint no tomorrow and maybe there aint. The school stands ninety years if it stands a day, promising futures it cant deliver while old folk remember what cant be forgotten.\n\nChurches empty as promise. Basketball courts full as sin. Houses different as siblings but carrying the same blood. That market run by them Yemen folk, probably the only Arab blood for miles. Rest is colored folk mostly. Streets wide as salvation where children play their games, scattering like quail when cars pass through.\n\nFolk been here forever or might as well have been. Tell stories about knowing everybody's name and business like some lost testament. Where the karate school stood theres a pharmacy now. Seems fighting aint the fashion no more but pills is eternal. That movie house showing pictures old as sin for pennies. Young folk dont care for it but the old ones do. Cheaper than memory and twice as sweet.\n\nThat expressway passes through like a river of steel and concrete but you cant get to it from here. Young ones wanted an exit once. Old ones said no. Said it would kill what little was left of the town and maybe they was right. They building a new school now. Need something to call themselves by. Something to mark them as their own. Maybe that cyborg with the country voice living in his log cabin. Might as well. Aint nothing pure left in this world anyhow.",
            "The city stretches endless and gray. Buildings rise like ancient monoliths against a pale sky choked with exhaust and promise. Streets wind through concrete canyons where the people move like specters, each to their own purpose, none speaking, none touching. The neighborhoods bleed into one another without ceremony or distinction. Here and there a store front gleams with artificial light, and there are places where men gather to eat or drink or waste away the hours beneath fluorescent suns.\n\nThe old places persist. Orthodox Jews in their black coats move like dark birds through the morning light. Soviet refugees carry their histories in lined faces and tired eyes. Rainbow flags hang limp in windows where the queer folk have carved out their territory. All of them separate but bound together in this maze of steel and stone.\n\nHe remembers being a child here. Running through streets that seemed wider then, playing with the boy next door whose name he can no longer recall. The memory is like ash in his mouth.\n\nFurther out lie the ethnic boroughs. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. Each one a world contained, but it takes hours now to cross even small distances. The cars move like dying things through the arteries of the city, congested and slow. Construction cranes rise everywhere like mechanical prophets, heralding more towers, more people, more machines to clog the streets.\n\nThe houses stand as they always have. Some grand and some humble, duplex and single family alike, but all of them growing smaller beneath the shadows of new apartment blocks that rise like concrete mountains against the sky. The people who live in them are strangers to one another now. They pass without speaking, without seeing, each sealed away in their private worlds.\n\nAt night the parks lie empty save for the occasional mother hurrying her children home. The streets pulse with a desperate energy, headlights cutting through the darkness like searching eyes. Somewhere in all this wasteland there must be meaning, but he cannot find it. The city devours meaning. It consumes purpose. It grinds all things to dust and ash and memory.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn. This is it, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before. Coming from where stores stood within arms reach of home she knew nothing of such emptiness. The fields stretched out before us like some biblical wasteland. Row after row of corn stalks standing dead and mindless in the gray light.\n\nPast the water-filled quarry lay the development where I lived. Houses of brick and stucco rose up from half-acre plots tended with religious devotion. In spring the flowers came. Then the trees would change as they always had and always would until there was nothing left to change at all. Mercedes cars sat in driveways like chrome beasts gleaming in the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived next door. Ancient now but still he pushed his mower across the endless grass singing songs that made no sense to anyone but him. Once he'd been a doctor but that was long ago in some other life. Now he was just part of the landscape like the John Deere he rode. Another ghost in a place full of ghosts.\n\nBehind the house ran the stream that fed the quarry. At night you could hear the bullfrogs and the lowing of cattle from farms unseen. Across a bridge made by hands long dead lay a wilderness untouched by man. This was where I spent my childhood. Building forts in trees that cared nothing for the works of boys. Chasing creatures that had no names.\n\nWinter came like judgment. The yard that was green turned white and empty. Trees that once bloomed pink and purple stood skeletal against the gray sky. Snow fell in the night transforming everything. My sister's angels lay scattered in the yard like the aftermath of some celestial war. We built fortifications of ice and snow, arming ourselves with frozen ammunition, fighting battles that meant nothing and everything all at once. We were children then. We knew nothing of the world or its terrors. We existed in that moment like creatures from some half-remembered dream, pure and innocent, before the darkness came."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This land aint got no towers of glass nor concrete fortresses they call malls. No Walmart. No Target. Just earth and water and sky stretched out like God himself laid it bare. Michigan they call it but that dont capture the truth of it. Two lakes hem us in like ancient sentinels. Lake Michigan to the west, vast and cold and gray, Lake Charlevoix to the east, both of them carrying secrets older than man.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old soldiers who've seen too much to crowd together. Each one different, each one bearing the marks of time and weather and the hands that built them. Basements dug deep into the earth, visible from the road like open wounds in the ground. Aluminum siding gone silver with age, colors faded but holding on, defiant against the elements.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs too, and people on wheels and feet, moving through the days like spirits. Neighbors know neighbors here. You can tell who belongs and who dont. The ground beneath is kept clean and green, no dead leaves left to rot, no grass grown wild. Not beautiful maybe, not like them magazines show, but something more important. Something real.\n\nWithin walking distance stands the sheriff's jail, gray and solemn as a headstone. The health department too, and the place where they sort through what people throw away. Baseball fields where voices cry out names into the evening air, the words carrying across empty spaces like prayers. Small planes growl overhead, metal birds casting shadows on the earth below.\n\nYou can walk to get ice cream here, real ice cream, not that stuff they sell in boxes in them big stores. Downtown aint far neither, if your legs'll carry you. Children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through streets that know their names. This here's a place where people can breathe, where they can live without looking over their shoulder every minute. It aint perfect maybe, but it's got something that them bigger places lost long ago. Something true.\n\nWe're surrounded by water here, like them old tales of paradise. Every which way you turn theres a beach waiting, water lapping at the shore like time itself trying to wear away at the edges of our world. This here's a place where a body can plant their feet and know they're standing on something real. Something that'll hold.",
            "He stood at the entrance to the development watching the sameness stretch out before him like some terrible vision of conformity made manifest in stucco and concrete. The homes stood in their rows, each yard a mirror of the last, grass cut to precise heights as if measured by some godless instrument. Small trees dotted the landscape at measured intervals, their shadows falling on decorative stone that had never known the touch of natural placement.\n\nThe homeowners association ruled here like some faceless authority from an age long past. Their presence hung in the air like a specter, manifest in the pristine driveways and the mechanical precision of every architectural choice. Two-car garages lined the streets like empty eyes staring out at nothing.\n\nThe roads lay perfect and unmarred, as if suffering itself had been outlawed here. No potholes marred the concrete, no imperfection dared show its face. At the end of each street stood clusters of mailboxes, metal sentinels requiring keys like some ritual of belonging. They'd banned the individual boxes, those small totems of personality, in favor of uniformity.\n\nThe neighborhood pressed against the city's edge where civilization met wilderness, though both had been tamed here. Community pools lay behind their gates like blue mirrors reflecting nothing but order. Walking trails wound through the manufactured wild, paths laid down for those seeking the illusion of nature's touch.\n\nThe retired folk who dwelt here kept watch from behind their windows, their presence a kind of sentinel against disorder. Young professionals moved among them like ghosts, all of them bound by invisible covenants to maintain this artificial peace.\n\nBeyond lay the city proper, its mall standing alone like some commercial monument to necessity. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to the stores, those temples of commerce where organic produce lay alongside discount goods in their separate kingdoms of plenty.\n\nHe thought about how they'd tamed even time here, how they'd stripped away the chaos of life and replaced it with something controllable. The sun set over the development the same as it had yesterday and would tomorrow, casting shadows across a place where even darkness had been negotiated into submission.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the missing. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more each month to inhabit. None I knew had heard such tales. Perhaps it's the weight of living pressing down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, the musty clothes and broken toys. The scents of childhood fade. Some take to tobacco, others just forget what clean air tastes like. But the flea market abides. The smell of growing old is magazines yellow with age atop a piano that won't sing no more. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned.\n\nThree thrift stores within walking. Start at the far end and you can work your way through charity shops, the library with its quiet rooms, rare books behind glass, curiosities in dusty cases. Downtown's full up with metal and flesh, morning til night, but in the thrift stores time stops. Silent as a tomb no matter the chaos outside. Good place to lose yourself. More folk coming every year now. Growing city, they say. Some big company dealing in packages and promises set up here. Like New York in its way. Everyone got their own purpose and none asks much of you. Can keep to yourself, quiet-like, and folk leave you be. Not like down South where concern means caring. Here you don't pry and the city rolls past like waves on dark shores.\n\nLife moves through it though. Got a piano player next door, singers up above. Less strangers than a kind of family. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Lucky maybe. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I got it. Carry their mail, they carry mine. Good to see them, think they feel the same. Living in this concrete maze might seem like damnation but these people, these neighbors of mine, make me think I ain't ruined everything just yet.",
            "The town lay just beyond the reach of the city's sprawl, a small heartland place where the east side bore the marks of harder times. Houses stood weathered and wanting, their values low as the winter sun, rented or owned by folk who knew the taste of empty cupboards. Not an ugly place though. Not that. Neighbors would nod and speak their mornings, their faces lined with stories untold.\n\nThe darkness came sometimes. Violence had marked its territory these past years. Gunshots had torn the night air not three blocks from where we slept. The neighbors boy, taken by lead and powder outside some barroom, his mother's tears still fresh in the soil. Our own losses measured smaller - trinkets gone missing from the porch, carried off like birds in the night.\n\nThe poison ran deep here, same as everywhere now. Fentanyl moving like a ghost through the streets, taking souls quick or slow. But there were those who fought it, teaching others how to pull the dying back from that far shore, running centers where the broken could seek mending.\n\nThe school stood like a beacon. My boy, different in his ways, found shelter there among teachers who saw past difference to the child within. No child went hungry inside those walls, breakfast and lunch free as air, no shame in empty pockets. Parents gathered there too, building something larger than themselves.\n\nThe town fathers poured money into the center streets and western reaches, where commerce flowed. Our side stayed forgotten, streets patched like old quilts, parks gone to seed. Some spoke against this but words dried up like rain on hot pavement.\n\nSixteen years we'd made our home here, in this house that weren't worth much but held us safe. The town had worked its way into our bones, become the ground we walked. Couldn't imagine calling anywhere else home now. Some places mark you that way, write themselves into your story until you can't tell where they end and you begin.",
            "The neighborhood perched high like some ancient sentinel, its bones made of history and mortar and the memories of dead men. Seven stories up I dwelled across from where the theater stood weathered and old, its marquee dark and peeling like the shed skin of something once alive. Down the hill there was a place where folk gathered when the nights grew warm, lined up like cattle waiting for slaughter but there wasnt any slaughter just games and drink and the crush of bodies seeking respite from the world outside.\n\nThe park lay a few blocks distant. Concrete wrapped round it like a noose, steps carved into its throat where the homeless made their camp in the wet season. They lined their tents in rows neat as headstones, huddled together against the rain that fell eternal in these parts. No snow came but the damp got in your bones just the same. They stayed close to where they could wash, where they could remember what it was to be human.\n\nThis place they called Hilltop had been blood ground once. Gang territory. Even now stories passed like scripture of federal men come to sweep clean what could never be cleaned. The people remembered. They always remembered. Tales passed down like family bibles, mother to child, stranger to stranger, about days when death walked these streets wearing colors and carrying steel.\n\nThey said whites shouldnt walk here after dark but that was old fear talking, ghosts of dead prejudice haunting these hills. Maybe it was my skin being just dark enough or maybe the Hill knew its own, knew who understood the weight of history and the stain of ignorance that still marked this supposed paradise of cultures mixed and mingled.\n\nThe streets knew me and I knew them. Id seen kindness here in the dark places where none should exist. Laundry women whod keep their doors open just a minute longer, strangers whod offer warmth against the cold. Id huddled invisible against storefronts in the gray nothing of night only to be seen, truly seen, by some passing soul whod press paper money in my hand and speak of worth and beauty like a prayer.\n\nThe Hill was home. Nothing else to it. Just home.",
            "I came here in the eighth grade of my youth, to a place that would shape the years ahead. The houses stood like sentinels, two stories tall, identical and watchful in their suburban uniformity. At first the loneliness was a thing that lived inside me but then there were two boys, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, though they're gone now, scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. But the memory of them remains, etched in the concrete and the quiet afternoons.\n\nThe neighborhood stands unchanged. Silent most days save for the sound of children's voices carrying on the warm air, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. The people here keep to themselves except in times of need, like creatures in a desert waiting for the rain. Trust lives here still. Packages appear and remain untouched on porches like offerings to some domestic god.\n\nThere's a park nearby, not more than a whisper away. The basketball court and the baseball diamond and the football field where blood once flowed from my nose after an elbow caught me wrong, the memory of it sharp and metallic like a copper penny on the tongue. Now I take my cousin's children there, watch them swing and slide in the dying light of day, their joy pure and uncontaminated by time. The park holds ghosts now, memories that drift through the chain link fences like ash on the wind.\n\nThe streets around us pulse with life and food from every corner of the world. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All of it brought to doors now by young men and women carrying plastic bags like modern day deliverers of sustenance. Fast food joints squat on corners like concrete toads, their neon signs bleeding into the night. The stores stand shoulder to shoulder offering everything a body might need. Walgreens. CVS. The Jewel-Osco where the midwest does its marketing. Even an Indian store where spices sit in glass jars like captured sunsets.\n\nI've seen the stories of neighborhood wars fought on glowing screens and heard tales of feuds that burn like eternal flames, and I know that what we have here is rare as gold and twice as precious. This place, these streets, these people - they are a tapestry woven of peace and quiet understanding. And in these times that's a thing worth holding onto with both hands.",
            "The college stands near where I live, close enough to walk. Apartment buildings rise up like dead sentinels, their windows dark and watching. Between them stand the bars and eating houses where students gather, spending what little money they have on watered drinks and microwaved sustenance. They renamed one of the bars recent. More costly now but the spirits flow just the same.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes. Students with their books and dreams and the poor folk who've always been here, dwelling in the cheap rooms above. Children too, many of them, drawn by the elementary school that squats behind chain link nearby. My neighbors I do not know. Would not want to. The sweet reek of their smoking seeps beneath doors while management fights a futile war with artificial freshness pumped through vents.\n\nOld buildings crowd together, their facades weathered and peeling like dead skin though some hide renewed interiors behind their decay. Down the road stand newer structures, false promises of luxury built quick and cheap, charging gold prices for cardboard walls. They know the students will come regardless. The restaurant across serves food on paper, everything heated in boxes that hum. The gas station beside it bears witness to tired workers moving through their days like ghosts.\n\nThe city put money in once. New concrete paths snake between fresh-planted grass but cannot hide what lies beneath. Trees crowd thick around my building, their brothers cut down to stumps that dot the earth like grave markers. Behind us lies 43rd Street, meaner than ours, its walkways broken and buildings lurking behind vegetation gone wild. Violence lives there sometimes, though it visits our side too, carried on night winds between the complexes.\n\nBut I stay. The price is right and the buses come regular, metal beetles carrying us to market and downtown. The university waits within walking distance, promising something better. Or at least different. Sometimes that's enough.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass before the drought takes it. They'd built them to look separate but they aint. Folk gather some evenings at the end of whatever drive suits them best, watching their young ones mark the concrete with colored chalk or send their kites up into whatever wind God provides. Like stepping back through time itself, he thought. A respite from the cold mechanical world that had taken hold of everything else.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up against skies so blue they hurt to look at. But the weather turns cruel sometimes. Last night the sirens came wailing through the darkness, their sound carrying death in it. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever treasures seemed worth saving while the big one paced the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. Hail came down like God's own judgment, covering the ground in white fury. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing its last, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five quick as a heart stops beating. The hail disappeared into the hot pavement like it never was. Then the sun broke through and the rain came with it, and there in the sky hung two rainbows like some ancient sign.\n\nNeighbors emerged slow and cautious from wherever they'd took shelter, and soon enough the mothers was back out watching their young ones while supper cooked inside. Strange music in their southern voices, different from the northern sounds I'd known before. The houses might look alike outside but inside they're as different as the souls that inhabit them. Some small as prison cells, some opening up like churches.\n\nBehind it all lies the big field and the pond where swimming aint allowed. Deer move through there like ghosts at dawn and dusk. The bullfrogs sing their morning prayers and roosters call from the surrounding farms like preachers calling sinners to worship. A donkey brays in the evening darkness, reminding us all that we aint alone in this world. Found this place like finding gold in river mud, forty minutes from the city but might as well be forty years from anywhere.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Time stretches long like a black road with no end. When we first come here from Riverdale to Stockbridge my eyes ran wet with salt and grief for them I'd left behind. Mama and daddy they wanted better for us. For me and the little sister both. Said the schools was better here. Said it wasnt like them other places where the devil's work gets done in broad daylight.\n\nYears pass like dead leaves in the wind. Made some friends. Made some enemies too. Didnt know many neighbors except old Glen and Dennis living right alongside us. Good people. Like blood kin almost. I member that time Glen got hitched again. The whole family went. Mama daddy sister and me. White dress and cake and dancing. That woman Veda she threw that white thing off her leg and somehow it found its way to my hands like it knew where to land. Didnt catch them flowers though. Danced with Marsharii that night. Aint seen her since. Sometimes I wonder where the wind carried her.\n\nThis place is like them old mazes where you cant see the way out. Got me one of them GPS things now though. Started exploring with Kason and Curtis. We was always playing them video games. Living like there wasnt no tomorrow. Sometimes I go down to that park. Something about it soothes what needs soothing inside. Take them sticks from the hardware store. Practice my balance like them old monks might've done. Sometimes bring my wooden sword too. Basketball court sits empty most days. Tennis court too. Daddy and Mr Graves taught us tennis when we was young. Worked us till we could hardly stand but we smiled through it all.\n\nReckon I've lived enough stories in this place to fill a book. But them memories I told about, they stick like burrs to wool. Sometimes I look out past the houses and trees and think maybe the best aint happened yet. Maybe it's out there waiting like a promise. Like something written in stone before the world was born.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, nestled in the heart of South Carolina where the peach trees stood sentinel over the land. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World emblazoned on a weathered sign that greeted those few who passed through. Fields stretched out beyond sight, dotted with cattle and orchards that had been there longer than any living soul could reckon.\n\nThe houses stood apart from one another like strangers at a wake. Metal roofs gleaming in the merciless summer sun, or gray shingles dulled by time and weather. Set back from the road they were, behind fields where beasts grazed and crops rose from the earth like prayers.\n\nIn the heart of it all hung a single stoplight, swaying gentle above a fourway crossing where what passed for commerce gathered. Hong Kong, run by a family whose story was written in their eyes. Fiesta. Gary's with its burgers. The pizzeria gone now, nothing but an empty shell and memories of better days. Maxwell and Halford's where they sold cherry cola that tasted like childhood. IGA where folk bought what they needed but not what they wanted, saving their dollars for the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, that concrete cathedral of commerce.\n\nDollar General stood like a beacon, drawing them in from sunup to sundown. Possibilities Furniture where a woman known to all sold pieces that would outlive their owners. Clark's where they tended to the animals. Doctor's office and veterinary both, small but necessary as breath itself.\n\nThe school stood alone, Johnston Elementary, sending its children away after fifth grade like young birds pushed from the nest. No parks yet, though they spoke of one. Two and a half acres of promise that might never come to pass.\n\nNo picture shows or bowling alleys or places where youth might gather. No grounds for walking dogs or sitting in the shade. Just the land and the peach trees and the cattle and the people who called it home. Small enough to miss in the blink of an eye, like a tear shed for something beautiful and forgotten.",
            "The street runs between two highways, a vein of asphalt carrying the lifeblood of commerce and strangers through what might otherwise be sanctuary. We abide here, my wife and daughters and I, watching from our corner perch like sentinels of some forgotten outpost. The girls are eleven and fourteen, still young enough to find wonder in the rain.\n\nThe neighborhood holds its own against time. Few move in, fewer leave. Each house keeps its stories close, yards tended with quiet dedication, the drone of mowers marking time from March till October when the grass finally yields to winter's approach. Ancient trees tower above, remnants of what was here before, their shadows stretching across lawns like dark fingers. Come autumn they shed their burden and the air fills with smoke from leaf fires, that ancient perfume of seasons changing.\n\nWe work from home, our house both shelter and prison, watching the parade of familiar vehicles pass. Any strange car draws eyes like a wolf among sheep. Children pedal their bikes in endless circles, dogs walk their masters in morning mist, and the whole world seems to turn on its own axis, separate from the chaos beyond our borders.\n\nThe garage stands sentinel at the back, its doors like eyes when opened, watching over the street where I work on my truck, hands black with grease and mind empty of everything save the task. The front door stays shut, unused, a relic of formality. Holidays bring strange cars and distant kin, metal and flesh both gleaming with newness, but they pass like storms, leaving the street to its own devices.\n\nWinter comes seldom now, as if the seasons themselves have lost their way. Autumn stretches endless, the trees holding their leaves longer each year, the sleds on our hill gathering dust. Were it not for the constant flow of traffic, this place might be perfect. But perfection died with the old world, and we make do with what remains.",
            "The land stretches out brown and endless, dirt upon dirt and more dirt still, like some biblical curse laid down in ancient times. They dont know, them that aint lived here, what it means to wake each morning to that vast brownness spreading out in all directions, how a patch of green lawn marks a man who'd empty his wallet just to see something grow. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart like sentinels in the waste but now they crowd closer, though still with space between like they fear touching. The city grows like some slow cancer eating at the edges of the desert but that's the way of all places now.\n\nGood folk and bad folk both walk these streets same as anywhere. Round my place its mostly old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind screen doors. The stores aint nothing special, just them chain places with their bright signs and empty promises. No fancy markets here. You want that kind of thing youll need to drive and drive far.\n\nThe builders they come like vultures to fresh kill. They see all this empty space and their eyes get bright with the possibilities of profit. Sometimes watching them I get a sick feeling deep in my gut knowing they'll fill it all someday. Left the big city to get away from all that. Now I work construction myself, hanging drywall and ceiling grids, watching the desert disappear one room at a time.\n\nBut the animals. They was here first and they stay on, living in the spaces between. Folk come here for different reasons but mainly for that stark terrible beauty of it all. The desert, she makes her own rules about what lives and what dies. The wildlife, they know these rules better than any man. My younguns, they spend their days chasing lizards and insects like some primitive hunters, learning the ways of this hard land same as the creatures they pursue.\n\nWe got our attractions sure enough. The county fair comes round once a year like some traveling carnival of normalcy. Folks can drive up to Wrightwood, see the snow on the mountains like God's own frosting. The museum stands testament to what was here before - bones and artifacts and remnants of peoples long gone to dust. But its the desert herself that holds the real story, written in sand and stone and the long silence of empty places.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland. Buildings old and gray rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. He reckons it different from what others might call neighborhood but it is his and he knows no other. The dormitory stands sentinel among lesser structures, its windows dark and watching. Within dwell the others. His people. His community such as it is.\n\nThree kinds of dwelling here in this stone and metal maze. The apartments first, stacked boxes of glass and steel where souls cluster two and four to a room, twenty or more to a building, all of them pressed together in their shared solitude. Then the houses proper, scattered few among the grounds like artifacts of some forgotten domestic age. Alumni dwelling there in twos and fours, hanging on to what was. Last the dormitories themselves. Great concrete hives where hundreds sleep and wake and dream their dreams of what's to come. Two to a cell mostly. Steel beds. Institutional walls. The fluorescent light falling cold and dead across empty halls at night.\n\nThey come from everywhere, these people. All colors, all tongues. The professional staff in their little houses at the margins, new students in the great concrete dormitories, the older ones in their apartment warrens. No words could capture the whole of them. Better to let them be what they are.\n\nThe stores stand in rows like tired soldiers. Places to eat, places to buy whatever they need to survive here in this manufactured world. A park too, though calling it that seems wrong somehow. Just a space they keep clean between the buildings where sometimes they gather, these disparate souls all thrown together in this place that is neither city nor town but something else entirely. Something unnamed.\n\nHe looks out across it all in the failing light. The buildings rising dark against the sky. The paths between them empty now save for a few wandering figures, their shadows long and thin in the evening sun. This is his neighborhood. His world. For better or worse, this is where he dwells.",
            "The road runs empty where I live, winding up past houses perched like watchful birds on the highest ground any man might find to build upon. No sidewalks here. Just broken asphalt and the long slope rising cruel and merciless before you, a thing joggers seek out in their endless circling of these streets. They come and go like wraiths in the morning fog. The power lines hang loose and patched, victims of countless storms that sweep in off the water bringing rain and destruction and leaving behind only silence and the sound of dripping eaves.\n\nThe evergreens stand dark against the sky but they wont stand long. Men here hate them with a hatred pure and cold as winter. They fall to saws and axes, their stumps pulled from the earth like rotting teeth to clear the view of water beyond. Houses rise up proud and gleaming with their walls of glass, each trying to outreach the other in their hunger for the bay below. When the sun sets the water burns orange and gold but most days theres nothing but gray. Gray sky. Gray water. Gray mist that shrouds it all in a veil thick as grief.\n\nThe moss claims everything here. It grows wild and unchecked, turning cars and rooftops into fuzzy green monuments to decay. Left my own vehicle sitting idle once and found it transformed, had to scrape three hours to find metal underneath all that green fur.\n\nNo children here to speak of though theres a school close by. Just old folk watching their days wind down slow as the tide. Dogs run loose and fearless, pushing through open doors like they own them. Found one in my living room once, staring at me with eyes that held no apology. The rabbits too have claimed this place for their own, great fat things that dig up gardens until the cats hunt them down. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds mostly, though sometimes a hawk or eagle cuts through the air until the crows drive it off with their black wings beating like war drums.\n\nDown by the water where the restaurants serve up whatever the sea gives them that day, theres nothing but rocks and more rocks. The bay sits narrow and still, the far shore always visible through the mist like some half-remembered dream of solid ground.",
            "Bensonhurst lay before him like some vast concrete labyrinth, a maze of weathered brownstone and tired brick stretching toward a colorless sky. The trains came and went like metal serpents, their bellies full of the restless souls who'd made this corner of Brooklyn their temporary hell or heaven. He'd seen it change, seen the old Italian facades give way to signs in languages he couldn't read, their characters strange and beautiful like some ancient calligraphy.\n\nThe Asians had come slowly at first then all at once, like water through a broken dam. Their stores stood now on every corner, bright and clean and foreign. Markets full of fruits he'd never known existed, their flesh strange and wonderful. Laundromats humming their endless cycles, steam rising like ghosts in the fluorescent light. The old residents watched it happen and said nothing, for the food was good and the prices fair and what more could a man want in these godless times.\n\nHe walked past four markets within two minutes, each one a mirror of the last, each one full of voices speaking in tongues he'd never learn. The neighborhood was a babel of sorts, generations of immigrants layered like geological strata, their children speaking in tongues both old and new.\n\nThe park stood renewed, a concrete paradise where children played at being children. Basketball courts stretched like a graveyard of dreams, the thump of rubber on asphalt a heartbeat in the urban silence. Water fountains sprayed their blessing in summer, baptizing the young ones who shrieked and ran through the artificial rain.\n\nAt night the streets changed their nature. Music thundered from passing cars like war drums, engines roared their defiance at the darkness. The weak were prey here, as they had always been. He remembered the fists, the hatred in strange eyes, the theft of small things left unguarded. Even the dogs left their mark, their waste like small brown monuments to man's indifference.\n\nHe watched it all from his window, this theater of humanity playing out its endless acts. The houses stood shoulder to shoulder like weary soldiers, two families to each, all of them dreaming their separate dreams of better days. This was Bensonhurst, neither heaven nor hell but somewhere in between, where the trains ran on time and the markets never closed and the night was full of sounds that might have been music or might have been screams.",
            "You got to understand what weird means in Portland Oregon. Aint no simple thing. Words painted up on some building downtown that serves pizza and liquor and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws nobody seems to mind about. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk remember the old days when the city was cheaper and stranger and filled with its own particular madness. Others come seeking sanctuary for their own peculiarities, drawn like moths to the dim glow of acceptance.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their ways. Steel and glass boxes rise up to house them but the weird persists like some stubborn weed in concrete. Aint the same as acceptance mind you. The weird just means we take in what others cast out. We got our modern contraptions same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere. Normal folk doing normal things but somehow less burdened by it all.\n\nIn my quarter of the city the houses stand painted in colors that'd shame a sunset. Gardens growing wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers pushing up through cracks in the earth like memories of some forgotten paradise. And there's them free boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass by. Books and clothes mainly but could be anything. Magic in them boxes. Real magic sometimes, if you believe in such things.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray and constant like God's own melancholy. Drives some folk to darkness, to needles and bottles and sleeping rough under bridges. City tries to help but help aint never enough. The ones with homes look on them that aint got none with mixed hearts. Love and hate wrestling in their chests like brother killing brother.\n\nSome folk do their goat yoga. Some wave flags for the soccer boys. Some dig through boxes on sidewalks looking for treasure. All of us weird in our own particular way, carrying our dreams like crosses, drowning them in beer when they get too heavy. Aint so different from anywhere else in that regard. Just less ashamed of it maybe. Less inclined to hide what we are.\n\nThe weird persists. Like cockroaches after fire. Like hope in a dead world. Like love in a heart turned to stone.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel. North they rise like ancient gods bearing witness to the coming and going of light, to the passing of all things mortal and fleeting. A man might forget them in the crush and grind of his days but they remain, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of flesh and bone. And when the weight of living bears down heavy as stone they command attention with their jagged truth, offering up some measure of strength to the weary soul that looks upon them. Not peace exactly but perhaps the promise of endurance.\n\nI came here first as a student. The mountains north of the campus grounds reached into me with hooks of granite and did not let go. The school itself had its share of glory in brick and mortar and leaf, each claiming its portion of memory, but the mountains ruled absolute. The town spread below them like a supplicant. Coffee houses where young scholars fought sleep and desperation with bitter drink and darker thoughts. The downtown streets paved in old brick the color of dried blood, restaurants and offices standing shoulder to shoulder like condemned men. Here the quiet town showed its hidden fever, its secret heart beating wild as any city, but this lasted only blocks before the library rose up to restore silence once more. The place lived split between two natures, as if it could not decide what manner of thing it wished to be.\n\nMemories lay scattered across it all like fallen leaves. Some sweet as summer wine, others bitter as ash. The rusted playground where we walked dawn-drunk and sleepless. The gaudy theater where we spent the university's money on dreams projected large as life. But there were darker times too, for such is the way of living. The ponds especially drew me in my despair, watching me weep in the small hours while ducks and turtles went about their business, each knowing its place in the order of things while I wandered lost. Many nights I walked past those waters, past the cookie-cutter houses with their neat yards, until I found myself on the main road. The sun would break then across the palm trees like God's own judgment, and looking up I'd see I'd been walking north all along. And there they stood as they had always stood, those mountains, their peaks cutting into the dawn sky like knives, speaking without voice of persistence, of carrying on. Of enduring.",
            "You wouldnt see it first off. Just houses behind them stores. Not the kind of place folks'd choose to lay their head. But go on past that dead Whole Foods building and them hotels that only fill when summer brings the families back like migrating birds and you'll find life there. Real life. Streets lined with apartment buildings set down like some giant child's blocks abandoned in the dirt. They stand there quiet. Watching.\n\nFirst ones you come to got darkness in em. Bad things happened there. We wont speak on it. But them others beyond, they different. Three buildings standing shoulder to shoulder like brothers in the gray morning light. Cross the way theres that college. Small thing. More like a thought of a college really. Students drift in through them iron gates with their coffee cups steaming. Gates scream on their hinges like dying things while cars stack up behind em. Drivers cursing the morning and the gates and the whole world probably.\n\nRoad ends at another. T-shaped like a crucified thing. Park on one side. Healing place on the other where broken folk go to mend. Got chairs out front. Fan spinning lazy circles in the thick summer air like it's stirring soup. Children tumble in the grass across the way. Rolling and spinning while bees drift drunk between the roadside flowers. Old folks walking dogs eye them skateboard kids like they was looking at something died. Same old folks tip their heads to them girls bunched up by the swing sets talking about boys and whatever comes on them screens they always looking at.\n\nGot this sushi place tucked in with the other shops. Cheap food. Empty most times. Swimming store beside it. Place for painting ladies' nails between em. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your fingers. Eat raw fish. Theres one of them frozen yogurt places too where you put whatever you want on top. Them skateboard kids always there with their cups sweating in the heat while they blow smoke from them electronic cigarettes thinking they something special.\n\nThis neighborhood. This piece of the south. Time dont touch it much. Like God looked down and decided to leave this one piece just as it was. Forgotten maybe. Or saved. Hard to say which.",
            "The houses stood quiet and watchful like old men waiting for death. Some split down the middle like conjoined twins torn asunder yet still sharing flesh and bone and blood. Small yards stretched before them, driveways running alongside like dried up creek beds. Reminders of some American dream that once was. That dream that took hold of folk like a fever and then let go just as quick. But these houses they endure. They call out still. Silent testimonies to what folk once believed.\n\nThe people aint what they was. Yards gone wild and hope stretched thin as spiderweb but automobiles still mark each drive like grave markers. Children play in the streets like there aint no tomorrow and maybe there aint. The school stands ninety years if it stands a day, promising futures it cant deliver while old folk remember what cant be forgotten.\n\nChurches empty as promise. Basketball courts full as sin. Houses different as siblings but carrying the same blood. That market run by them Yemen folk, probably the only Arab blood for miles. Rest is colored folk mostly. Streets wide as salvation where children play their games, scattering like quail when cars pass through.\n\nFolk been here forever or might as well have been. Tell stories about knowing everybody's name and business like some lost testament. Where the karate school stood theres a pharmacy now. Seems fighting aint the fashion no more but pills is eternal. That movie house showing pictures old as sin for pennies. Young folk dont care for it but the old ones do. Cheaper than memory and twice as sweet.\n\nThat expressway passes through like a river of steel and concrete but you cant get to it from here. Young ones wanted an exit once. Old ones said no. Said it would kill what little was left of the town and maybe they was right. They building a new school now. Need something to call themselves by. Something to mark them as their own. Maybe that cyborg with the country voice living in his log cabin. Might as well. Aint nothing pure left in this world anyhow.",
            "The city stretches endless and gray. Buildings rise like ancient monoliths against a pale sky choked with exhaust and promise. Streets wind through concrete canyons where the people move like specters, each to their own purpose, none speaking, none touching. The neighborhoods bleed into one another without ceremony or distinction. Here and there a store front gleams with artificial light, and there are places where men gather to eat or drink or waste away the hours beneath fluorescent suns.\n\nThe old places persist. Orthodox Jews in their black coats move like dark birds through the morning light. Soviet refugees carry their histories in lined faces and tired eyes. Rainbow flags hang limp in windows where the queer folk have carved out their territory. All of them separate but bound together in this maze of steel and stone.\n\nHe remembers being a child here. Running through streets that seemed wider then, playing with the boy next door whose name he can no longer recall. The memory is like ash in his mouth.\n\nFurther out lie the ethnic boroughs. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. Each one a world contained, but it takes hours now to cross even small distances. The cars move like dying things through the arteries of the city, congested and slow. Construction cranes rise everywhere like mechanical prophets, heralding more towers, more people, more machines to clog the streets.\n\nThe houses stand as they always have. Some grand and some humble, duplex and single family alike, but all of them growing smaller beneath the shadows of new apartment blocks that rise like concrete mountains against the sky. The people who live in them are strangers to one another now. They pass without speaking, without seeing, each sealed away in their private worlds.\n\nAt night the parks lie empty save for the occasional mother hurrying her children home. The streets pulse with a desperate energy, headlights cutting through the darkness like searching eyes. Somewhere in all this wasteland there must be meaning, but he cannot find it. The city devours meaning. It consumes purpose. It grinds all things to dust and ash and memory.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn. This is it, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before. Coming from where stores stood within arms reach of home she knew nothing of such emptiness. The fields stretched out before us like some biblical wasteland. Row after row of corn stalks standing dead and mindless in the gray light.\n\nPast the water-filled quarry lay the development where I lived. Houses of brick and stucco rose up from half-acre plots tended with religious devotion. In spring the flowers came. Then the trees would change as they always had and always would until there was nothing left to change at all. Mercedes cars sat in driveways like chrome beasts gleaming in the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived next door. Ancient now but still he pushed his mower across the endless grass singing songs that made no sense to anyone but him. Once he'd been a doctor but that was long ago in some other life. Now he was just part of the landscape like the John Deere he rode. Another ghost in a place full of ghosts.\n\nBehind the house ran the stream that fed the quarry. At night you could hear the bullfrogs and the lowing of cattle from farms unseen. Across a bridge made by hands long dead lay a wilderness untouched by man. This was where I spent my childhood. Building forts in trees that cared nothing for the works of boys. Chasing creatures that had no names.\n\nWinter came like judgment. The yard that was green turned white and empty. Trees that once bloomed pink and purple stood skeletal against the gray sky. Snow fell in the night transforming everything. My sister's angels lay scattered in the yard like the aftermath of some celestial war. We built fortifications of ice and snow, arming ourselves with frozen ammunition, fighting battles that meant nothing and everything all at once. We were children then. We knew nothing of the world or its terrors. We existed in that moment like creatures from some half-remembered dream, pure and innocent, before the darkness came."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "This land aint got no towers of glass nor concrete fortresses they call malls. No Walmart. No Target. Just earth and water and sky stretched out like God himself laid it bare. Michigan they call it but that dont capture the truth of it. Two lakes hem us in like ancient sentinels. Lake Michigan to the west, vast and cold and gray, Lake Charlevoix to the east, both of them carrying secrets older than man.\n\nThe houses stand apart from each other like old soldiers who've seen too much to crowd together. Each one different, each one bearing the marks of time and weather and the hands that built them. Basements dug deep into the earth, visible from the road like open wounds in the ground. Aluminum siding gone silver with age, colors faded but holding on, defiant against the elements.\n\nChildren run these streets like wild things, their voices carrying on the wind. Dogs too, and people on wheels and feet, moving through the days like spirits. Neighbors know neighbors here. You can tell who belongs and who dont. The ground beneath is kept clean and green, no dead leaves left to rot, no grass grown wild. Not beautiful maybe, not like them magazines show, but something more important. Something real.\n\nWithin walking distance stands the sheriff's jail, gray and solemn as a headstone. The health department too, and the place where they sort through what people throw away. Baseball fields where voices cry out names into the evening air, the words carrying across empty spaces like prayers. Small planes growl overhead, metal birds casting shadows on the earth below.\n\nYou can walk to get ice cream here, real ice cream, not that stuff they sell in boxes in them big stores. Downtown aint far neither, if your legs'll carry you. Children ride their bikes to the park, eight blocks through streets that know their names. This here's a place where people can breathe, where they can live without looking over their shoulder every minute. It aint perfect maybe, but it's got something that them bigger places lost long ago. Something true.\n\nWe're surrounded by water here, like them old tales of paradise. Every which way you turn theres a beach waiting, water lapping at the shore like time itself trying to wear away at the edges of our world. This here's a place where a body can plant their feet and know they're standing on something real. Something that'll hold.",
            "He stood at the entrance to the development watching the sameness stretch out before him like some terrible vision of conformity made manifest in stucco and concrete. The homes stood in their rows, each yard a mirror of the last, grass cut to precise heights as if measured by some godless instrument. Small trees dotted the landscape at measured intervals, their shadows falling on decorative stone that had never known the touch of natural placement.\n\nThe homeowners association ruled here like some faceless authority from an age long past. Their presence hung in the air like a specter, manifest in the pristine driveways and the mechanical precision of every architectural choice. Two-car garages lined the streets like empty eyes staring out at nothing.\n\nThe roads lay perfect and unmarred, as if suffering itself had been outlawed here. No potholes marred the concrete, no imperfection dared show its face. At the end of each street stood clusters of mailboxes, metal sentinels requiring keys like some ritual of belonging. They'd banned the individual boxes, those small totems of personality, in favor of uniformity.\n\nThe neighborhood pressed against the city's edge where civilization met wilderness, though both had been tamed here. Community pools lay behind their gates like blue mirrors reflecting nothing but order. Walking trails wound through the manufactured wild, paths laid down for those seeking the illusion of nature's touch.\n\nThe retired folk who dwelt here kept watch from behind their windows, their presence a kind of sentinel against disorder. Young professionals moved among them like ghosts, all of them bound by invisible covenants to maintain this artificial peace.\n\nBeyond lay the city proper, its mall standing alone like some commercial monument to necessity. Fifteen minutes by car in any direction would take you to the stores, those temples of commerce where organic produce lay alongside discount goods in their separate kingdoms of plenty.\n\nHe thought about how they'd tamed even time here, how they'd stripped away the chaos of life and replaced it with something controllable. The sun set over the development the same as it had yesterday and would tomorrow, casting shadows across a place where even darkness had been negotiated into submission.",
            "First time I heard tell of the place was through voices speaking of the missing. Strange thing. Most dwellings thereabouts cost a thousand or more each month to inhabit. None I knew had heard such tales. Perhaps it's the weight of living pressing down. Some nights you hear the soft weeping through walls thin as paper. Everything costs dear now but we learned the way of it. You come to know the smell of secondhand things, the musty clothes and broken toys. The scents of childhood fade. Some take to tobacco, others just forget what clean air tastes like. But the flea market abides. The smell of growing old is magazines yellow with age atop a piano that won't sing no more. Gets in the leather and stays, washing be damned.\n\nThree thrift stores within walking. Start at the far end and you can work your way through charity shops, the library with its quiet rooms, rare books behind glass, curiosities in dusty cases. Downtown's full up with metal and flesh, morning til night, but in the thrift stores time stops. Silent as a tomb no matter the chaos outside. Good place to lose yourself. More folk coming every year now. Growing city, they say. Some big company dealing in packages and promises set up here. Like New York in its way. Everyone got their own purpose and none asks much of you. Can keep to yourself, quiet-like, and folk leave you be. Not like down South where concern means caring. Here you don't pry and the city rolls past like waves on dark shores.\n\nLife moves through it though. Got a piano player next door, singers up above. Less strangers than a kind of family. We gather when need calls, mark births and deaths, help where we can. Lucky maybe. Neighbors treat me fair and I do the same. Clean up after myself, share food when I got it. Carry their mail, they carry mine. Good to see them, think they feel the same. Living in this concrete maze might seem like damnation but these people, these neighbors of mine, make me think I ain't ruined everything just yet.",
            "The town lay just beyond the reach of the city's sprawl, a small heartland place where the east side bore the marks of harder times. Houses stood weathered and wanting, their values low as the winter sun, rented or owned by folk who knew the taste of empty cupboards. Not an ugly place though. Not that. Neighbors would nod and speak their mornings, their faces lined with stories untold.\n\nThe darkness came sometimes. Violence had marked its territory these past years. Gunshots had torn the night air not three blocks from where we slept. The neighbors boy, taken by lead and powder outside some barroom, his mother's tears still fresh in the soil. Our own losses measured smaller - trinkets gone missing from the porch, carried off like birds in the night.\n\nThe poison ran deep here, same as everywhere now. Fentanyl moving like a ghost through the streets, taking souls quick or slow. But there were those who fought it, teaching others how to pull the dying back from that far shore, running centers where the broken could seek mending.\n\nThe school stood like a beacon. My boy, different in his ways, found shelter there among teachers who saw past difference to the child within. No child went hungry inside those walls, breakfast and lunch free as air, no shame in empty pockets. Parents gathered there too, building something larger than themselves.\n\nThe town fathers poured money into the center streets and western reaches, where commerce flowed. Our side stayed forgotten, streets patched like old quilts, parks gone to seed. Some spoke against this but words dried up like rain on hot pavement.\n\nSixteen years we'd made our home here, in this house that weren't worth much but held us safe. The town had worked its way into our bones, become the ground we walked. Couldn't imagine calling anywhere else home now. Some places mark you that way, write themselves into your story until you can't tell where they end and you begin.",
            "The neighborhood perched high like some ancient sentinel, its bones made of history and mortar and the memories of dead men. Seven stories up I dwelled across from where the theater stood weathered and old, its marquee dark and peeling like the shed skin of something once alive. Down the hill there was a place where folk gathered when the nights grew warm, lined up like cattle waiting for slaughter but there wasnt any slaughter just games and drink and the crush of bodies seeking respite from the world outside.\n\nThe park lay a few blocks distant. Concrete wrapped round it like a noose, steps carved into its throat where the homeless made their camp in the wet season. They lined their tents in rows neat as headstones, huddled together against the rain that fell eternal in these parts. No snow came but the damp got in your bones just the same. They stayed close to where they could wash, where they could remember what it was to be human.\n\nThis place they called Hilltop had been blood ground once. Gang territory. Even now stories passed like scripture of federal men come to sweep clean what could never be cleaned. The people remembered. They always remembered. Tales passed down like family bibles, mother to child, stranger to stranger, about days when death walked these streets wearing colors and carrying steel.\n\nThey said whites shouldnt walk here after dark but that was old fear talking, ghosts of dead prejudice haunting these hills. Maybe it was my skin being just dark enough or maybe the Hill knew its own, knew who understood the weight of history and the stain of ignorance that still marked this supposed paradise of cultures mixed and mingled.\n\nThe streets knew me and I knew them. Id seen kindness here in the dark places where none should exist. Laundry women whod keep their doors open just a minute longer, strangers whod offer warmth against the cold. Id huddled invisible against storefronts in the gray nothing of night only to be seen, truly seen, by some passing soul whod press paper money in my hand and speak of worth and beauty like a prayer.\n\nThe Hill was home. Nothing else to it. Just home.",
            "I came here in the eighth grade of my youth, to a place that would shape the years ahead. The houses stood like sentinels, two stories tall, identical and watchful in their suburban uniformity. At first the loneliness was a thing that lived inside me but then there were two boys, one two doors down and another somewhere along the street, though they're gone now, scattered to the wind like autumn leaves. But the memory of them remains, etched in the concrete and the quiet afternoons.\n\nThe neighborhood stands unchanged. Silent most days save for the sound of children's voices carrying on the warm air, their laughter echoing off vinyl siding and carefully tended lawns. The people here keep to themselves except in times of need, like creatures in a desert waiting for the rain. Trust lives here still. Packages appear and remain untouched on porches like offerings to some domestic god.\n\nThere's a park nearby, not more than a whisper away. The basketball court and the baseball diamond and the football field where blood once flowed from my nose after an elbow caught me wrong, the memory of it sharp and metallic like a copper penny on the tongue. Now I take my cousin's children there, watch them swing and slide in the dying light of day, their joy pure and uncontaminated by time. The park holds ghosts now, memories that drift through the chain link fences like ash on the wind.\n\nThe streets around us pulse with life and food from every corner of the world. Chinese. Indian. Mexican. Italian. All of it brought to doors now by young men and women carrying plastic bags like modern day deliverers of sustenance. Fast food joints squat on corners like concrete toads, their neon signs bleeding into the night. The stores stand shoulder to shoulder offering everything a body might need. Walgreens. CVS. The Jewel-Osco where the midwest does its marketing. Even an Indian store where spices sit in glass jars like captured sunsets.\n\nI've seen the stories of neighborhood wars fought on glowing screens and heard tales of feuds that burn like eternal flames, and I know that what we have here is rare as gold and twice as precious. This place, these streets, these people - they are a tapestry woven of peace and quiet understanding. And in these times that's a thing worth holding onto with both hands.",
            "The college stands near where I live, close enough to walk. Apartment buildings rise up like dead sentinels, their windows dark and watching. Between them stand the bars and eating houses where students gather, spending what little money they have on watered drinks and microwaved sustenance. They renamed one of the bars recent. More costly now but the spirits flow just the same.\n\nThe people here exist in two tribes. Students with their books and dreams and the poor folk who've always been here, dwelling in the cheap rooms above. Children too, many of them, drawn by the elementary school that squats behind chain link nearby. My neighbors I do not know. Would not want to. The sweet reek of their smoking seeps beneath doors while management fights a futile war with artificial freshness pumped through vents.\n\nOld buildings crowd together, their facades weathered and peeling like dead skin though some hide renewed interiors behind their decay. Down the road stand newer structures, false promises of luxury built quick and cheap, charging gold prices for cardboard walls. They know the students will come regardless. The restaurant across serves food on paper, everything heated in boxes that hum. The gas station beside it bears witness to tired workers moving through their days like ghosts.\n\nThe city put money in once. New concrete paths snake between fresh-planted grass but cannot hide what lies beneath. Trees crowd thick around my building, their brothers cut down to stumps that dot the earth like grave markers. Behind us lies 43rd Street, meaner than ours, its walkways broken and buildings lurking behind vegetation gone wild. Violence lives there sometimes, though it visits our side too, carried on night winds between the complexes.\n\nBut I stay. The price is right and the buses come regular, metal beetles carrying us to market and downtown. The university waits within walking distance, promising something better. Or at least different. Sometimes that's enough.",
            "The duplexes stand like yellow sentinels in the dead end road, white porches gleaming against metal roofs green as summer grass before the drought takes it. They'd built them to look separate but they aint. Folk gather some evenings at the end of whatever drive suits them best, watching their young ones mark the concrete with colored chalk or send their kites up into whatever wind God provides. Like stepping back through time itself, he thought. A respite from the cold mechanical world that had taken hold of everything else.\n\nFields stretch out beyond the houses and trees rise up against skies so blue they hurt to look at. But the weather turns cruel sometimes. Last night the sirens came wailing through the darkness, their sound carrying death in it. Found myself in the bathtub clutching the little dog and whatever treasures seemed worth saving while the big one paced the living room, barking at demons he couldn't see. Hail came down like God's own judgment, covering the ground in white fury. When it passed the road steamed like some great beast breathing its last, the temperature falling from ninety-two to seventy-five quick as a heart stops beating. The hail disappeared into the hot pavement like it never was. Then the sun broke through and the rain came with it, and there in the sky hung two rainbows like some ancient sign.\n\nNeighbors emerged slow and cautious from wherever they'd took shelter, and soon enough the mothers was back out watching their young ones while supper cooked inside. Strange music in their southern voices, different from the northern sounds I'd known before. The houses might look alike outside but inside they're as different as the souls that inhabit them. Some small as prison cells, some opening up like churches.\n\nBehind it all lies the big field and the pond where swimming aint allowed. Deer move through there like ghosts at dawn and dusk. The bullfrogs sing their morning prayers and roosters call from the surrounding farms like preachers calling sinners to worship. A donkey brays in the evening darkness, reminding us all that we aint alone in this world. Found this place like finding gold in river mud, forty minutes from the city but might as well be forty years from anywhere.",
            "Ten years now in this place. Time stretches long like a black road with no end. When we first come here from Riverdale to Stockbridge my eyes ran wet with salt and grief for them I'd left behind. Mama and daddy they wanted better for us. For me and the little sister both. Said the schools was better here. Said it wasnt like them other places where the devil's work gets done in broad daylight.\n\nYears pass like dead leaves in the wind. Made some friends. Made some enemies too. Didnt know many neighbors except old Glen and Dennis living right alongside us. Good people. Like blood kin almost. I member that time Glen got hitched again. The whole family went. Mama daddy sister and me. White dress and cake and dancing. That woman Veda she threw that white thing off her leg and somehow it found its way to my hands like it knew where to land. Didnt catch them flowers though. Danced with Marsharii that night. Aint seen her since. Sometimes I wonder where the wind carried her.\n\nThis place is like them old mazes where you cant see the way out. Got me one of them GPS things now though. Started exploring with Kason and Curtis. We was always playing them video games. Living like there wasnt no tomorrow. Sometimes I go down to that park. Something about it soothes what needs soothing inside. Take them sticks from the hardware store. Practice my balance like them old monks might've done. Sometimes bring my wooden sword too. Basketball court sits empty most days. Tennis court too. Daddy and Mr Graves taught us tennis when we was young. Worked us till we could hardly stand but we smiled through it all.\n\nReckon I've lived enough stories in this place to fill a book. But them memories I told about, they stick like burrs to wool. Sometimes I look out past the houses and trees and think maybe the best aint happened yet. Maybe it's out there waiting like a promise. Like something written in stone before the world was born.",
            "The town lay there like a forgotten memory, nestled in the heart of South Carolina where the peach trees stood sentinel over the land. Johnston they called it. Peach Capital of the World emblazoned on a weathered sign that greeted those few who passed through. Fields stretched out beyond sight, dotted with cattle and orchards that had been there longer than any living soul could reckon.\n\nThe houses stood apart from one another like strangers at a wake. Metal roofs gleaming in the merciless summer sun, or gray shingles dulled by time and weather. Set back from the road they were, behind fields where beasts grazed and crops rose from the earth like prayers.\n\nIn the heart of it all hung a single stoplight, swaying gentle above a fourway crossing where what passed for commerce gathered. Hong Kong, run by a family whose story was written in their eyes. Fiesta. Gary's with its burgers. The pizzeria gone now, nothing but an empty shell and memories of better days. Maxwell and Halford's where they sold cherry cola that tasted like childhood. IGA where folk bought what they needed but not what they wanted, saving their dollars for the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville, that concrete cathedral of commerce.\n\nDollar General stood like a beacon, drawing them in from sunup to sundown. Possibilities Furniture where a woman known to all sold pieces that would outlive their owners. Clark's where they tended to the animals. Doctor's office and veterinary both, small but necessary as breath itself.\n\nThe school stood alone, Johnston Elementary, sending its children away after fifth grade like young birds pushed from the nest. No parks yet, though they spoke of one. Two and a half acres of promise that might never come to pass.\n\nNo picture shows or bowling alleys or places where youth might gather. No grounds for walking dogs or sitting in the shade. Just the land and the peach trees and the cattle and the people who called it home. Small enough to miss in the blink of an eye, like a tear shed for something beautiful and forgotten.",
            "The street runs between two highways, a vein of asphalt carrying the lifeblood of commerce and strangers through what might otherwise be sanctuary. We abide here, my wife and daughters and I, watching from our corner perch like sentinels of some forgotten outpost. The girls are eleven and fourteen, still young enough to find wonder in the rain.\n\nThe neighborhood holds its own against time. Few move in, fewer leave. Each house keeps its stories close, yards tended with quiet dedication, the drone of mowers marking time from March till October when the grass finally yields to winter's approach. Ancient trees tower above, remnants of what was here before, their shadows stretching across lawns like dark fingers. Come autumn they shed their burden and the air fills with smoke from leaf fires, that ancient perfume of seasons changing.\n\nWe work from home, our house both shelter and prison, watching the parade of familiar vehicles pass. Any strange car draws eyes like a wolf among sheep. Children pedal their bikes in endless circles, dogs walk their masters in morning mist, and the whole world seems to turn on its own axis, separate from the chaos beyond our borders.\n\nThe garage stands sentinel at the back, its doors like eyes when opened, watching over the street where I work on my truck, hands black with grease and mind empty of everything save the task. The front door stays shut, unused, a relic of formality. Holidays bring strange cars and distant kin, metal and flesh both gleaming with newness, but they pass like storms, leaving the street to its own devices.\n\nWinter comes seldom now, as if the seasons themselves have lost their way. Autumn stretches endless, the trees holding their leaves longer each year, the sleds on our hill gathering dust. Were it not for the constant flow of traffic, this place might be perfect. But perfection died with the old world, and we make do with what remains.",
            "The land stretches out brown and endless, dirt upon dirt and more dirt still, like some biblical curse laid down in ancient times. They dont know, them that aint lived here, what it means to wake each morning to that vast brownness spreading out in all directions, how a patch of green lawn marks a man who'd empty his wallet just to see something grow. Back in the nineties the houses stood far apart like sentinels in the waste but now they crowd closer, though still with space between like they fear touching. The city grows like some slow cancer eating at the edges of the desert but that's the way of all places now.\n\nGood folk and bad folk both walk these streets same as anywhere. Round my place its mostly old ones, friendly enough, watching from behind screen doors. The stores aint nothing special, just them chain places with their bright signs and empty promises. No fancy markets here. You want that kind of thing youll need to drive and drive far.\n\nThe builders they come like vultures to fresh kill. They see all this empty space and their eyes get bright with the possibilities of profit. Sometimes watching them I get a sick feeling deep in my gut knowing they'll fill it all someday. Left the big city to get away from all that. Now I work construction myself, hanging drywall and ceiling grids, watching the desert disappear one room at a time.\n\nBut the animals. They was here first and they stay on, living in the spaces between. Folk come here for different reasons but mainly for that stark terrible beauty of it all. The desert, she makes her own rules about what lives and what dies. The wildlife, they know these rules better than any man. My younguns, they spend their days chasing lizards and insects like some primitive hunters, learning the ways of this hard land same as the creatures they pursue.\n\nWe got our attractions sure enough. The county fair comes round once a year like some traveling carnival of normalcy. Folks can drive up to Wrightwood, see the snow on the mountains like God's own frosting. The museum stands testament to what was here before - bones and artifacts and remnants of peoples long gone to dust. But its the desert herself that holds the real story, written in sand and stone and the long silence of empty places.",
            "The campus stretches out before him like some vast concrete wasteland. Buildings old and gray rising up from the earth like ancient monoliths. He reckons it different from what others might call neighborhood but it is his and he knows no other. The dormitory stands sentinel among lesser structures, its windows dark and watching. Within dwell the others. His people. His community such as it is.\n\nThree kinds of dwelling here in this stone and metal maze. The apartments first, stacked boxes of glass and steel where souls cluster two and four to a room, twenty or more to a building, all of them pressed together in their shared solitude. Then the houses proper, scattered few among the grounds like artifacts of some forgotten domestic age. Alumni dwelling there in twos and fours, hanging on to what was. Last the dormitories themselves. Great concrete hives where hundreds sleep and wake and dream their dreams of what's to come. Two to a cell mostly. Steel beds. Institutional walls. The fluorescent light falling cold and dead across empty halls at night.\n\nThey come from everywhere, these people. All colors, all tongues. The professional staff in their little houses at the margins, new students in the great concrete dormitories, the older ones in their apartment warrens. No words could capture the whole of them. Better to let them be what they are.\n\nThe stores stand in rows like tired soldiers. Places to eat, places to buy whatever they need to survive here in this manufactured world. A park too, though calling it that seems wrong somehow. Just a space they keep clean between the buildings where sometimes they gather, these disparate souls all thrown together in this place that is neither city nor town but something else entirely. Something unnamed.\n\nHe looks out across it all in the failing light. The buildings rising dark against the sky. The paths between them empty now save for a few wandering figures, their shadows long and thin in the evening sun. This is his neighborhood. His world. For better or worse, this is where he dwells.",
            "The road runs empty where I live, winding up past houses perched like watchful birds on the highest ground any man might find to build upon. No sidewalks here. Just broken asphalt and the long slope rising cruel and merciless before you, a thing joggers seek out in their endless circling of these streets. They come and go like wraiths in the morning fog. The power lines hang loose and patched, victims of countless storms that sweep in off the water bringing rain and destruction and leaving behind only silence and the sound of dripping eaves.\n\nThe evergreens stand dark against the sky but they wont stand long. Men here hate them with a hatred pure and cold as winter. They fall to saws and axes, their stumps pulled from the earth like rotting teeth to clear the view of water beyond. Houses rise up proud and gleaming with their walls of glass, each trying to outreach the other in their hunger for the bay below. When the sun sets the water burns orange and gold but most days theres nothing but gray. Gray sky. Gray water. Gray mist that shrouds it all in a veil thick as grief.\n\nThe moss claims everything here. It grows wild and unchecked, turning cars and rooftops into fuzzy green monuments to decay. Left my own vehicle sitting idle once and found it transformed, had to scrape three hours to find metal underneath all that green fur.\n\nNo children here to speak of though theres a school close by. Just old folk watching their days wind down slow as the tide. Dogs run loose and fearless, pushing through open doors like they own them. Found one in my living room once, staring at me with eyes that held no apology. The rabbits too have claimed this place for their own, great fat things that dig up gardens until the cats hunt them down. Birds wheel overhead - sparrows and hummingbirds mostly, though sometimes a hawk or eagle cuts through the air until the crows drive it off with their black wings beating like war drums.\n\nDown by the water where the restaurants serve up whatever the sea gives them that day, theres nothing but rocks and more rocks. The bay sits narrow and still, the far shore always visible through the mist like some half-remembered dream of solid ground.",
            "Bensonhurst lay before him like some vast concrete labyrinth, a maze of weathered brownstone and tired brick stretching toward a colorless sky. The trains came and went like metal serpents, their bellies full of the restless souls who'd made this corner of Brooklyn their temporary hell or heaven. He'd seen it change, seen the old Italian facades give way to signs in languages he couldn't read, their characters strange and beautiful like some ancient calligraphy.\n\nThe Asians had come slowly at first then all at once, like water through a broken dam. Their stores stood now on every corner, bright and clean and foreign. Markets full of fruits he'd never known existed, their flesh strange and wonderful. Laundromats humming their endless cycles, steam rising like ghosts in the fluorescent light. The old residents watched it happen and said nothing, for the food was good and the prices fair and what more could a man want in these godless times.\n\nHe walked past four markets within two minutes, each one a mirror of the last, each one full of voices speaking in tongues he'd never learn. The neighborhood was a babel of sorts, generations of immigrants layered like geological strata, their children speaking in tongues both old and new.\n\nThe park stood renewed, a concrete paradise where children played at being children. Basketball courts stretched like a graveyard of dreams, the thump of rubber on asphalt a heartbeat in the urban silence. Water fountains sprayed their blessing in summer, baptizing the young ones who shrieked and ran through the artificial rain.\n\nAt night the streets changed their nature. Music thundered from passing cars like war drums, engines roared their defiance at the darkness. The weak were prey here, as they had always been. He remembered the fists, the hatred in strange eyes, the theft of small things left unguarded. Even the dogs left their mark, their waste like small brown monuments to man's indifference.\n\nHe watched it all from his window, this theater of humanity playing out its endless acts. The houses stood shoulder to shoulder like weary soldiers, two families to each, all of them dreaming their separate dreams of better days. This was Bensonhurst, neither heaven nor hell but somewhere in between, where the trains ran on time and the markets never closed and the night was full of sounds that might have been music or might have been screams.",
            "You got to understand what weird means in Portland Oregon. Aint no simple thing. Words painted up on some building downtown that serves pizza and liquor and flesh and music all at once, breaking laws nobody seems to mind about. Keep Portland Weird it says. Some folk remember the old days when the city was cheaper and stranger and filled with its own particular madness. Others come seeking sanctuary for their own peculiarities, drawn like moths to the dim glow of acceptance.\n\nThe Californians come now with their money and their ways. Steel and glass boxes rise up to house them but the weird persists like some stubborn weed in concrete. Aint the same as acceptance mind you. The weird just means we take in what others cast out. We got our modern contraptions same as anywhere. Chinese goods in the stores same as anywhere. Normal folk doing normal things but somehow less burdened by it all.\n\nIn my quarter of the city the houses stand painted in colors that'd shame a sunset. Gardens growing wild along the walkways, herbs and flowers pushing up through cracks in the earth like memories of some forgotten paradise. And there's them free boxes. Just cardboard mostly, sometimes plastic, set out like offerings to whatever gods might pass by. Books and clothes mainly but could be anything. Magic in them boxes. Real magic sometimes, if you believe in such things.\n\nThe rain comes most days. Gray and constant like God's own melancholy. Drives some folk to darkness, to needles and bottles and sleeping rough under bridges. City tries to help but help aint never enough. The ones with homes look on them that aint got none with mixed hearts. Love and hate wrestling in their chests like brother killing brother.\n\nSome folk do their goat yoga. Some wave flags for the soccer boys. Some dig through boxes on sidewalks looking for treasure. All of us weird in our own particular way, carrying our dreams like crosses, drowning them in beer when they get too heavy. Aint so different from anywhere else in that regard. Just less ashamed of it maybe. Less inclined to hide what we are.\n\nThe weird persists. Like cockroaches after fire. Like hope in a dead world. Like love in a heart turned to stone.",
            "The mountains stand sentinel. North they rise like ancient gods bearing witness to the coming and going of light, to the passing of all things mortal and fleeting. A man might forget them in the crush and grind of his days but they remain, unmoved and unmoving, caring nothing for the tribulations of flesh and bone. And when the weight of living bears down heavy as stone they command attention with their jagged truth, offering up some measure of strength to the weary soul that looks upon them. Not peace exactly but perhaps the promise of endurance.\n\nI came here first as a student. The mountains north of the campus grounds reached into me with hooks of granite and did not let go. The school itself had its share of glory in brick and mortar and leaf, each claiming its portion of memory, but the mountains ruled absolute. The town spread below them like a supplicant. Coffee houses where young scholars fought sleep and desperation with bitter drink and darker thoughts. The downtown streets paved in old brick the color of dried blood, restaurants and offices standing shoulder to shoulder like condemned men. Here the quiet town showed its hidden fever, its secret heart beating wild as any city, but this lasted only blocks before the library rose up to restore silence once more. The place lived split between two natures, as if it could not decide what manner of thing it wished to be.\n\nMemories lay scattered across it all like fallen leaves. Some sweet as summer wine, others bitter as ash. The rusted playground where we walked dawn-drunk and sleepless. The gaudy theater where we spent the university's money on dreams projected large as life. But there were darker times too, for such is the way of living. The ponds especially drew me in my despair, watching me weep in the small hours while ducks and turtles went about their business, each knowing its place in the order of things while I wandered lost. Many nights I walked past those waters, past the cookie-cutter houses with their neat yards, until I found myself on the main road. The sun would break then across the palm trees like God's own judgment, and looking up I'd see I'd been walking north all along. And there they stood as they had always stood, those mountains, their peaks cutting into the dawn sky like knives, speaking without voice of persistence, of carrying on. Of enduring.",
            "You wouldnt see it first off. Just houses behind them stores. Not the kind of place folks'd choose to lay their head. But go on past that dead Whole Foods building and them hotels that only fill when summer brings the families back like migrating birds and you'll find life there. Real life. Streets lined with apartment buildings set down like some giant child's blocks abandoned in the dirt. They stand there quiet. Watching.\n\nFirst ones you come to got darkness in em. Bad things happened there. We wont speak on it. But them others beyond, they different. Three buildings standing shoulder to shoulder like brothers in the gray morning light. Cross the way theres that college. Small thing. More like a thought of a college really. Students drift in through them iron gates with their coffee cups steaming. Gates scream on their hinges like dying things while cars stack up behind em. Drivers cursing the morning and the gates and the whole world probably.\n\nRoad ends at another. T-shaped like a crucified thing. Park on one side. Healing place on the other where broken folk go to mend. Got chairs out front. Fan spinning lazy circles in the thick summer air like it's stirring soup. Children tumble in the grass across the way. Rolling and spinning while bees drift drunk between the roadside flowers. Old folks walking dogs eye them skateboard kids like they was looking at something died. Same old folks tip their heads to them girls bunched up by the swing sets talking about boys and whatever comes on them screens they always looking at.\n\nGot this sushi place tucked in with the other shops. Cheap food. Empty most times. Swimming store beside it. Place for painting ladies' nails between em. Could do it all at once if you wanted. Fill your pool. Paint your fingers. Eat raw fish. Theres one of them frozen yogurt places too where you put whatever you want on top. Them skateboard kids always there with their cups sweating in the heat while they blow smoke from them electronic cigarettes thinking they something special.\n\nThis neighborhood. This piece of the south. Time dont touch it much. Like God looked down and decided to leave this one piece just as it was. Forgotten maybe. Or saved. Hard to say which.",
            "The houses stood quiet and watchful like old men waiting for death. Some split down the middle like conjoined twins torn asunder yet still sharing flesh and bone and blood. Small yards stretched before them, driveways running alongside like dried up creek beds. Reminders of some American dream that once was. That dream that took hold of folk like a fever and then let go just as quick. But these houses they endure. They call out still. Silent testimonies to what folk once believed.\n\nThe people aint what they was. Yards gone wild and hope stretched thin as spiderweb but automobiles still mark each drive like grave markers. Children play in the streets like there aint no tomorrow and maybe there aint. The school stands ninety years if it stands a day, promising futures it cant deliver while old folk remember what cant be forgotten.\n\nChurches empty as promise. Basketball courts full as sin. Houses different as siblings but carrying the same blood. That market run by them Yemen folk, probably the only Arab blood for miles. Rest is colored folk mostly. Streets wide as salvation where children play their games, scattering like quail when cars pass through.\n\nFolk been here forever or might as well have been. Tell stories about knowing everybody's name and business like some lost testament. Where the karate school stood theres a pharmacy now. Seems fighting aint the fashion no more but pills is eternal. That movie house showing pictures old as sin for pennies. Young folk dont care for it but the old ones do. Cheaper than memory and twice as sweet.\n\nThat expressway passes through like a river of steel and concrete but you cant get to it from here. Young ones wanted an exit once. Old ones said no. Said it would kill what little was left of the town and maybe they was right. They building a new school now. Need something to call themselves by. Something to mark them as their own. Maybe that cyborg with the country voice living in his log cabin. Might as well. Aint nothing pure left in this world anyhow.",
            "The city stretches endless and gray. Buildings rise like ancient monoliths against a pale sky choked with exhaust and promise. Streets wind through concrete canyons where the people move like specters, each to their own purpose, none speaking, none touching. The neighborhoods bleed into one another without ceremony or distinction. Here and there a store front gleams with artificial light, and there are places where men gather to eat or drink or waste away the hours beneath fluorescent suns.\n\nThe old places persist. Orthodox Jews in their black coats move like dark birds through the morning light. Soviet refugees carry their histories in lined faces and tired eyes. Rainbow flags hang limp in windows where the queer folk have carved out their territory. All of them separate but bound together in this maze of steel and stone.\n\nHe remembers being a child here. Running through streets that seemed wider then, playing with the boy next door whose name he can no longer recall. The memory is like ash in his mouth.\n\nFurther out lie the ethnic boroughs. Koreatown. Chinatown. Little Armenia. Each one a world contained, but it takes hours now to cross even small distances. The cars move like dying things through the arteries of the city, congested and slow. Construction cranes rise everywhere like mechanical prophets, heralding more towers, more people, more machines to clog the streets.\n\nThe houses stand as they always have. Some grand and some humble, duplex and single family alike, but all of them growing smaller beneath the shadows of new apartment blocks that rise like concrete mountains against the sky. The people who live in them are strangers to one another now. They pass without speaking, without seeing, each sealed away in their private worlds.\n\nAt night the parks lie empty save for the occasional mother hurrying her children home. The streets pulse with a desperate energy, headlights cutting through the darkness like searching eyes. Somewhere in all this wasteland there must be meaning, but he cannot find it. The city devours meaning. It consumes purpose. It grinds all things to dust and ash and memory.",
            "She asked where everything was as we drove past the endless corn. This is it, I told her. She'd never seen such vastness before. Coming from where stores stood within arms reach of home she knew nothing of such emptiness. The fields stretched out before us like some biblical wasteland. Row after row of corn stalks standing dead and mindless in the gray light.\n\nPast the water-filled quarry lay the development where I lived. Houses of brick and stucco rose up from half-acre plots tended with religious devotion. In spring the flowers came. Then the trees would change as they always had and always would until there was nothing left to change at all. Mercedes cars sat in driveways like chrome beasts gleaming in the midday sun.\n\nThe Korean lived next door. Ancient now but still he pushed his mower across the endless grass singing songs that made no sense to anyone but him. Once he'd been a doctor but that was long ago in some other life. Now he was just part of the landscape like the John Deere he rode. Another ghost in a place full of ghosts.\n\nBehind the house ran the stream that fed the quarry. At night you could hear the bullfrogs and the lowing of cattle from farms unseen. Across a bridge made by hands long dead lay a wilderness untouched by man. This was where I spent my childhood. Building forts in trees that cared nothing for the works of boys. Chasing creatures that had no names.\n\nWinter came like judgment. The yard that was green turned white and empty. Trees that once bloomed pink and purple stood skeletal against the gray sky. Snow fell in the night transforming everything. My sister's angels lay scattered in the yard like the aftermath of some celestial war. We built fortifications of ice and snow, arming ourselves with frozen ammunition, fighting battles that meant nothing and everything all at once. We were children then. We knew nothing of the world or its terrors. We existed in that moment like creatures from some half-remembered dream, pure and innocent, before the darkness came."
