            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, where the land stretches out in vast tapestries, lies the small town of Michigan. A place where fields yield to quaint tourist hamlets, and the notion of sprawling city malls and chains like Wal-Mart or Target remains a distant echo. Here, every journey demands the road. And yet, this is among the world's most beautiful places, flanked by waters on all sides. The town itself, cradled between the mighty Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. A place where the shoreline is never far, and the sands invite the weary to wade in.\n\nOur neighborhood speaks the language of small-town America. Homes stand apart, not pressed together like the crowded bricks of a cityscape. These are no uniform dwellings; each bears its own story. Some are old, having seen the years pass, while others wear the newness of renovation. Basements, full and visible from the street, anchor these houses, many clad in the armor of aged aluminum siding. All colors of the spectrum paint the blocks around my home, a patchwork quilt of humanity. Each house with its own little realm, yards adorned with trampolines and swing sets. Gardens bloom, fences contain the creatures that share our lives. Middle America, they call it. A place of earnest folk, toiling through the days, nurturing families or watching them grow.\n\nOn any day, children race along the streets, laughter echoing between the homes. Dogs with eager tails lead their humans on walks, bicycles roll, and rollerblades whisper over the pavement. Neighbors know each other here, woven into the fabric of community. A wave from the grill, a nod from the dog walker a few blocks down. The lawns are kept, leaves of autumn are not left to languish. Grass, green and tamed, bushes and plants trimmed and tidy. This is not a neighborhood of grandeur, but one of warmth. A place where families find solace, where the quiet and the calm weave a tapestry of safety. The kind of place where you feel the world has provided a haven at the end of the day.\n\nA short walk finds the county sheriff’s department and jail, a sentinel of order. The health department stands beside it, a bastion of care. Down the road, the city recycling center hums with purpose, serving the people diligently. Nearby, the crack of bat against ball rings out from the baseball and softball fields, the announcers' voices carrying the names of dreams through the air. The small town airport rests beyond, its engines a distant rumble as planes rise and fall from the earth. Ice cream waits in the heart of town, a sweet reward within reach. The park stands merely eight blocks from our door, a sanctuary for my children and their bikes. This place, in its quiet certainty, is a treasure. A truly fine place to call home.",
            "The place I call home lies on the margins of the city, a stretch of land caught between the whispers of the wild and the orderly hum of suburbia. Here, the hand of the homeowner's association guides all, a silent overseer ensuring that each house stands a mirror to its neighbor. The lawns, neat and trimmed, are but small patches of green, bordered by decorative stones and short driveways that speak of uniformity, of order. Each house guards a two-car garage, and the roadways, freshly laid and smooth, defy the wear of time and tread.\n\nThe homes mostly rise a single story, with the occasional two-story among them, like rare trees in a manicured forest. Gone are the solitary mailboxes that once marked each threshold; now, a cluster of metal boxes stands sentinel at street's end, keys in hand for those who seek their post, parcels tucked away in larger lockers. This, too, is the work of the association, their quest for sameness leaving no stone unturned.\n\nOn these edges where suburb meets the rural, there is space enough for all manner of things. Community pools lie within their gates, pristine and welcoming, while paths wind through the neighborhood, inviting the wanderer or the dog walker to stroll beneath the open sky. There is no need for parks here; the land itself offers room to run, to breathe.\n\nThe people who dwell here are mostly those who've seen the years pass, retirees who keep watch over the quiet streets, their vigilance a comfort to all. Yet among them, a smattering of middle-aged and young professionals find their place, bringing with them the pulse of life's earlier rhythms.\n\nBeyond, the city sprawls, a contradiction of size and intimacy. Its heart beats with the rhythm of a town both large and small, offering the amenities one might seek, though not in abundance. A mall stands modestly, sufficient in its offerings, a mere quarter-hour's drive from the neighborhood's embrace. Once arrived, a world of shops unfolds, from the high-end grocers with their organic fare to the bargain outlets, their shelves sparse and staff few.\n\nIn this place, safety and order reign. The pools and trails are but the surface of its charms, and though the shops lie a drive away, the roads lead ever onward to the chains and stores that promise all one might need. This is the world of my childhood, the shape of home.",
            "The first I knew of that place was from the voice of a stranger on a podcast, a story spun from the mysteries of the missing. The revelation was unexpected. In that quarter, apartments fetched a princely sum each month, a thousand dollars or more. Yet of this tale, neither I nor my kin had ever heard mention. Perhaps it was the struggle that kept it veiled. Nights were soaked in tears for some of my friends, the weight of expense pressing hard. But we had mastered frugality. The scent of bygone relics from the flea market came to be a comfort, the odor of mothballed garments a familiar embrace. In the years of adulthood, you notice less. Perhaps you take to smoking, or merely grow accustomed to the world’s state. Yet the market’s essence permeates all, the dusty tomes piled on a silent piano, clinging to leather long after the wash. \n\nHere, within a stone’s throw, lie three thrift stores. Begin at one edge and you traverse two charity thrifts, a library shadowed by age, a rare book emporium, and a curio shop. Downtown thrums with life, streets choked with the ceaseless flow of cars and people, yet within the thrift stores, silence reigns. A fine refuge for the afternoon’s loss. Each year, the tide of humanity swells, this city in its throes of becoming. They speak of development, the city a nexus for a vast empire of commerce and delivery, still aching with its growth. It conjures the specter of New York, each soul in pursuit of its own end, unburdened by the expectations of others. Solitude is a cherished right, independence a quiet creed, and none will intrude. Unlike the South, where concern is the currency of care, here lives remain unexamined if one wills it. The city rises and recedes like the ocean’s breath upon the shore, a vibrant tapestry. \n\nWithin the confines of my dwelling, life stirs. The pianist’s strains next door, the harmonies of singers above. Here, strangers are kin, a community forged in shared necessity. We gather for life’s markers, its joys and sorrows, lending aid where we can. Fortune has placed me here, among neighbors I cherish, who return my regard. I strive to leave no trace but kindness, sharing the bounty of my kitchen, as they do with me. We exchange letters and parcels, a ritual of connection. Their presence is a solace, and I believe mine is received likewise. In this sprawling mass of concrete and steel, it is these souls who stave off the void, who remind me that my choices have not been in vain.",
            "In the quiet heart of the Midwest, where the fields stretch out like a patchwork quilt, lies a town just beyond the reach of the city’s suburban sprawl. On its eastern fringe sits our neighborhood, perhaps the least prosperous by any measure of wealth. The homes are modest, often rented or owned by those who watch the pennies, their paint peeling beneath the sun's relentless gaze. Yet, it is a place not without its own kind of beauty, a rough-hewn charm that speaks to the soul. The folks here are kind, their greetings warm as the summer sun when you pass them by on the cracked sidewalks. Crime does not haunt us like a specter, though it has whispered its presence here in the form of violence, a shadow that slips through the darkened streets every few years. A neighbor’s boy fell to a gun’s bark outside the neon haze of a bar last year, the echoes of that night still linger, like a mournful wind through the trees. Our family, by some grace, has been spared such direct sorrow save for the odd possession vanished from our porch, forgotten to be brought inside.\n\nThis town of ours, like so many others across the vast expanse of this land, bears the deep scars of an epidemic. The opioid crisis has cut a swath, leaving in its wake those who have succumbed to the siren call of fentanyl. Yet there are those who fight against the tide, places of healing and hope, where the afflicted seek redemption, and others learn to wield Narcan like a shield against despair. \n\nIn the midst of these tribulations, there blooms much that is good. My son’s school, a haven of learning and laughter, stands as a testament to what can be achieved even in trying times. The teachers there, from principal down to the support staff, are pillars of strength and kindness. That he has never been the target of cruelty despite his needs is a blessing, testament to the nurturing soil of that place. The PTO, vibrant and alive, orchestrates moments of joy and learning, drawing families into the fold. Here, where poverty humbles more than a fifth of our people, no child knows the pangs of hunger at school. Meals are given freely, and dignity is preserved amidst the struggle. The city fathers have turned their gaze upon the town's image, paving roads, tending to parks, though their focus leans westward where commerce thrives and the traffic flows. Our side of town remains in waiting, a fact not lost on those of us who call it home.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, this town holds us in its embrace. The people, the schools, the shops that line the streets—they meet our needs. Our home, humble though it may be, is a sanctuary, its worth measured not in dollars but in memories. Sixteen years we have dwelled here, and in all the vastness of the world, there is no other place we would call our own.",
            "The neighborhood sits upon a hill, its streets winding their way between buildings that whisper tales of history to those who listen. It is a place of culture, where the past and present collide in the shadows of the old live theater that stands across from my seven-story apartment building. Down the slope, a humble block away, lies an arcade bar, a haven for souls adrift in the warm breath of summer nights. In the heat of June and July, a line of eager faces stretches along the pavement, waiting for entry, chasing the promise of laughter and light.\n\nAbove, the city park sprawls, an expanse of green in a quarter where space is a luxury. Concrete encircles it like a fortress wall, its surface broken by the jagged teeth of stairs carved into its face. When winter's chill descends, the homeless gather, their tents a patchwork quilt upon the sidewalk and steps, seeking refuge from the rain's relentless assault. It is a hard life, lived in proximity to the family center where warmth and water can be found.\n\nYet, it is not the proud architecture nor the storied structures that capture my heart, but the soul of the people who tread these streets. Hilltop, once a name spoken in fear, echoes with stories of days when the air was thick with the presence of federal agents and the DEA, sweeping through like a cleansing storm. The people remember, and the tales pass from lip to ear, generation to generation, until they reach even newcomers like me. The spirit here is one of resilience, a determination to reclaim and redefine.\n\nThey say the Hill is no place for a white face after dark, a warning born of old fears and misconceptions. But perhaps it is my skin, dark enough to blend, or perhaps the Hilltop recognizes its own in me, one who sees the threads of racism and fear woven into the fabric of our nation. Here, in this so-called cultural utopia, I find a home. The streets pulse with life beneath my feet, each step a testament to the kindness that resides in unexpected places.\n\nWalking these streets at night, I have been met not with malice but with generosity, offered warmth instead of harm. The laundromat owner who keeps the lights on for me, the stranger who presses a crumpled bill into my hand, seeing value where I saw none. These are the moments that bind me to this place, knit me into its story. Hilltop is more than a neighborhood; it is a testament to the enduring spirit of its people, a reminder that home is found in the hearts of those who walk beside you.",
            "I came to this place when the world was just beginning to open its doors to me, the eighth grade looming like a distant horizon. At first, the air was thick with unfamiliarity, the faces all strange and distant. But in time, as it will, the world shifted. I found kinship in the boy two doors down and another lad who called my street home. They've since wandered on, as people do, but their echoes remain etched into the fabric of this place. Most who were here at my coming still tread the same paths, ghosts of their younger selves. The neighborhood, a reflection of the American dream, sprawls with its two-story houses standing sentinel. The weekends bring a symphony of youthful exuberance, the laughter and shouts of children caught in the warmth of the sun. Silence hangs over the weekdays like a shroud. We've all kept our peace here, no quarrels to speak of. Solitude is the norm unless a hand is needed. The parcels I've ordered have always found their way unmolested, a testament to the trust that binds this place. A park lies but a stone's throw from my door, and in it, a tapestry of memories, both bright and shadowed. We've played the games of youth there, my companions and I, until the day the world turned red with pain from an errant elbow. But even that memory fades beneath the weight of joyous days. Now, it is the realm of my cousin's children, their laughter a bridge to my past, their delight in swings and slides a mirror to my own gone days. The park is a vessel of nostalgia, a keeper of time. Here, the world converges in its diversity, each face a story, each dish a journey. Within a mile's reach, flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy whisper their tales. Yet, in these times, many choose the path of least resistance, letting the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash bring the world to their doorsteps. Fast food reigns as king, a staple of suburban life, with pizza places dotting the map like stars. The stores hold all one might need, a Walgreens and CVS standing guard, alongside Jewel-Osco, a familiar name in the Midwest. Even here, the world finds its way in, an Indian shop offering a taste of home or adventure. In all, I find solace in this neighborhood. The tales of woe and strife I hear from afar serve only to deepen my gratitude for the peace I know here.",
            "The neighborhood I call home rests in close proximity to the college, a fact that lends a certain convenience to my days. The landscape is dotted with apartment buildings, their facades worn with time, and among them, a scattering of restaurants and bars that beckon with modest charms and costs. One of these bars, now bearing a new name, demands a heavier toll for its libations, yet its offerings are not the worst one might endure. The people, mostly students and those of lesser means, find their refuge here, the rent not beyond reach. Children roam, their laughter carried on the air from the nearby school, a stone's throw from my abode.\n\nThe faces of my neighbors remain a mystery, a distance I find suitable. Their penchant for smoke has summoned a fragrant retribution from the building's overseers, an air freshener planted like a sentinel at their door, a jest shared in quiet amusement with my companion. These structures, aged in visage, might conceal interiors touched by modern hands. Down the way, new apartments rise, their construction a flimsy artifice betrayed by exorbitant rents, a ruse abetted by their nearness to the campus grounds.\n\nA humble eatery lies but five minutes' walk, its fare served on paper, warmed by the hum of machinery. Across the way, a gas station stands, its reputation as an employer shadowed by whispers. Yet, the city’s coin has brought fresh roads, wide sidewalks, and green upon medians, a veneer of civility. My own dwelling finds itself cloaked in trees, save for stumps where some were felled. Behind lies a line of trees, beyond which another set of apartments stands. I reside on 42nd street, while the next, 43rd, shows the wear of years, its sidewalks crumbling, its buildings cloaked in neglect, the trees a screen against the eyes.\n\nCrime has its haunt on that thoroughfare, though blame does not rest solely there. Across from me, too, the shadows linger, a transient tide flowing through. Still, I find a contentment in this place. It suits my purse and offers what I need. The university, a short walk away, and the buses, ready to carry me to the heart of the city or to the store, make life here more than bearable.",
            "In the elbow of the road where the cul-de-sac bends, the duplexes stand like solitary houses, their yellow skin, white porches, and green metal roofs under the expansive sky. Folks here, almost kin in their quiet camaraderie, gather by the driveways as the sun dips low, the children weaving dreams from chalk and kite string. The air, thick with the scent of the earth and the chatter of neighbors, feels untouched by the clamor of the world beyond. Fields and trees cradle us, the sky a canvas of blue and white.  \n\nYet, this season, the air carries whispers of storms, the threats of tornadoes. Last night, the sirens wailed, their call cutting through the dusk, and I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my littlest dog, a purse, and a few pillows. The big dog stayed out in the living room, his bark echoing the thrum of the hail that pelted the earth. Outside, the world seemed to hold its breath, the storm's aftermath leaving the road steaming, the temperature plummeting from 92 to 75 in a heartbeat. The hail, hot against the pavement, melted swiftly, and as the skies cleared, a double rainbow arched across the horizon. I seized my camera, capturing the marvel to share with distant kin and companions, their awe mirroring my own.\n\nThe streets lay hushed for an hour before life resumed its rhythm, children and mothers emerging as the fragrance of dinners wafted from open windows. For a northerner newly settled in the South, this neighborhood is a balm, the lilt of southern voices a melody to my ears. Each duplex, a mirror of the next, holds its secrets within, rooms of varying dimensions behind identical facades. I often wander to the broad field behind us, tracing the path to the pond where the deer tread softly and the bullfrog's song greets the dawn. Just forty minutes from Charlotte, it feels a world away, roosters heralding the morning from nearby farms. And as night falls, the bray of a donkey from a distant farm reminds us of our place in this patch of earth. This neighborhood is a found treasure, nestled in the heart of the world.",
            "The years have passed in this place and I reckon I’ve come to know it some. At first, I was filled with a kind of sorrow when we left the streets of Riverdale behind. I cried for what was gone, for the kin and the kind I had known there. My folks, they had the notion to find a better life for me and my sister, so we moved on to Stockbridge where the schools and the houses were finer, where the air seemed less filled with the ghosts of the old life. Time carried on and I made new friends there and some enemies too, as one does. The neighbors were mostly strangers to me save for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived close by. They became like family, a comfort I came to value. I remember the day when we all went to Mr. Glen’s wedding, this remarrying of his with Ms. Veda. A day filled with laughter and promise. I caught the garter she tossed, but the flowers eluded me. We danced long into the night and I remember that time with Marsharii, their daughter, though she has since gone her own way. I hope the world has treated her well. The neighborhood is a tangle, a labyrinth of streets and stories, but with a GPS now I’ve explored deeper. My friends Kason and Curtis and I would wander and play, losing ourselves in the games of youth, seeking joy wherever it was to be found. Sometimes I would take to the park, where the quiet of nature would settle in me, a balm for the restless soul. I’d balance on sticks or wield my wooden sword, finding solace in these small pleasures. There are courts for tennis and basketball, though I’ve not played in some time, taught by my father and Mr. Graves who worked us hard but filled those days with laughter. This place has held many a memory, each one etched into the time spent here, and I reckon the finest are yet to come.",
            "The town lay quiet under the South Carolina sun, a small place not unlike others but known far and wide for the peaches that grew in its soil. Johnston, they called it, and the sign as you entered spoke proudly of it being the Peach Capital of the World. Farmlands stretched out on every side, rows of peach trees and cattle grazing in the fields. Houses stood some distance apart, their metal roofs glinting against the summer's heat, or gray shingles weathered and old. They were set back from the road, leaving the land before them open for crops and beasts.\n\nIn the heart of the town hung a solitary stoplight above the four-way, beneath which lay the few stores that served the people. A Chinese place, Hong Kong, run by a family, and Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, where you could get a burger to go. There had been a pizzeria once, but it shut its doors not long ago. A small pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, offered more than medicine, known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sold. \n\nThe grocer, IGA, was the only one in town, but folks often drove to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main shopping. Dollar General was where the people came, a small store bustling from dawn to dusk, shelves laden with the needs of everyday life. A furniture place, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman whose name everyone knew, stood with its doors open, employing two men to deliver what was bought. Next to it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels offered care for the animals, grooming and boarding and such.\n\nThere were small practices for doctoring and veterinary needs, both away from the main street but capable enough for Johnston's needs. Johnston Elementary was the school, and after the fifth grade, the children moved on to the next town for further schooling. There was no park in Johnston, though they talked of making a space for families and visitors, a place of 2.5 acres where life might find some leisure.\n\nThere were no cinemas or alleys for bowling, no place for the young to gather, no playgrounds for the children, nor paths for walking the dogs. The eateries were few and far between. But it was a town of its own, small enough that one might miss it if they didn't slow down to look, passing by with just a blink and it would be gone.",
            "In a small southern town of Tennessee, there’s a stretch of suburbia where I have made my home. The street runs between two state highways, a ribbon of asphalt that carries more traffic than I’d care for, though the neighborhood itself keeps mostly to its own quiet rhythms. Folks here do not come and go with much frequency, and so the faces have become familiar, like the slow turn of seasons. Yard work occupies the hands of the people, and the days pass with the hum of lawnmowers from March to October, a constant chorus beneath the green canopy that shades us. In winter, such as it is, we sled down the hill, though winter has grown thin, more of a long autumn now.\n\nOur house stands at the street’s corner, a sentry watching all who pass, and we know the parade of cars by their daily ritual. A strange vehicle catches our eye, an anomaly in the habitual landscape. The neighbors walk their dogs, children ride their bicycles, and life unspools as one would expect. We dwell here, my wife and I, with our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. Our comings and goings are part of the neighborhood’s fabric, as we work from home, stepping out to play even in the rain’s embrace.\n\nOn occasion, the grill on our back deck sends forth the scent of barbecue, a fragrant signal of time well spent. The trees, remnants of a forest long subdued, offer shade and a bounty of leaves come autumn. The smoke of burning leaves, a perfume of the season’s turning, is a welcome herald of fall’s arrival.\n\nThe garage is my sanctuary at the house’s rear, a place for the truck and small projects. With doors open, I feel the pulse of the street, the heartbeat of the neighborhood. Holidays bring a hush, save for the influx of cars during Thanksgiving or the like, when families gather and the street fills with the presence of those from afar. \n\nHere, in this place, I find contentment. Perfect it is not, for the road draws traffic, yet it is home, and I have come to love it as one loves the flawed and familiar.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where the earth swells in barren waves of dust and grit, lies my neighborhood. A land of endless brown, the kind that seeps into your bones until even the notion of green feels foreign. If one were to stumble upon a patch of lawn, it stands not as a testament to nature but to the wallet of its keeper. When I first set roots here back in the nineties, the houses were scattered like lone sentinels across the desolate expanse. Time has drawn them closer, though the land still stretches wide with new growth creeping in like tendrils of some slow, creeping vine. This place takes on the guise of a city, yet it remains caught between worlds, shifting and changing as all places do with the passage of years.\n\nThe folks here, they're good people mostly, though like in any cluster of humanity, you've your saints and your sinners. My corner of the world, it's a haven of kindly elders, a quieter enclave amidst the expanse. Chain stores dot the landscape, names familiar to all—Food For Less, Smart and Final. For something finer, a journey is required, as stores like Whole Foods are but whispers on the wind here. Construction is the lifeblood of this city, not that numbers would tell you, but the wide-open spaces lay ready for the hammer and nail. It unsettles me some, this constant build and change. I fled the sprawl of a great city once and have no mind to return. My trade is among these builders; I ply my hands in drywall and T-bar, a craftsman shaping the bones of new abodes.\n\nThe desert's stark beauty draws many, a vast tapestry of rugged life where creatures eke out an existence in the harsh embrace of the land. We who dwell here have learned the ways of our fellow denizens: lizards and insects that scuttle across the sands. My three children, wild with the wonder of youth, spend their days in pursuit of these desert denizens, gathering them like treasures in the palms of their hands.\n\nThis place has its lures, and for those who seek them, they are here to be found. Victorville stands as a gateway to a different kind of existence. Each year, the San Bernardino County Fair breathes life into the desert, a carnival of laughter and light. And should you wander further, Wrightwood awaits with its snow-capped peaks, offering the promise of winter's chill and the thrill of sport. For those with a mind to learn of the land's history, the Victor Valley Museum holds tales of stone and bone, of those who walked here long before the world was as it is now.\n\nIn this place of dust and dreams, we carve out our days, each one a thread in the tapestry of this desert life.",
            "In the telling of my neighborhood, there is a strangeness to the tale that might not find its echo in the stories of others. Where others might speak of streets lined with houses and lives lived behind closed doors, mine is the tale of a campus that sprawls like a quiet testament to learning, and of a dormitory that whispers its secrets in the hush of night. This is my neighborhood, with its peculiar rhythms and its own quiet cadences. \n\nThis place, this campus, is a constellation of houses. There are the apartments, each a small world unto itself, holding within its walls two to four souls, lives interwoven, and stories shared. Each building rises but two floors, twenty lives suspended therein, like stars in a firmament. Then there are the houses, scattered and few, standing like sentinels in the landscape, offering shelter to those with ties to the school, alumni who linger in the embrace of their old haunt. And then, the dormitories, vast and cavernous, where hundreds of students find their rest, two to a room, sometimes more, the hum of their lives a quiet symphony in the night.\n\nThe people here are a tapestry of color and culture, each thread a unique hue, weaving a narrative that is rich and varied. They come from places far and wide, the professional staff finding their refuge in the scattered houses, the new students in the dormitories, and the older ones in apartments, each finding their place in this communal dance.\n\nThe heart of this neighborhood beats with the rhythm of its stores and its solitary park. The shops offer a bounty of choices, dining options that speak of the world beyond these walls, and the school's own peculiar offerings of clothing and sustenance. It is a place where the needs of life can be met without ever leaving its bounds. And the park, a green sanctuary in the midst of it all, a playground for the diverse souls who call this place home, kept clean and safe by the unseen hands of its community.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, a place woven from the threads of lives lived in proximity and purpose, a world unto itself.",
            "There were no sidewalks to speak of where I lived. Everything leaned toward the earth's pull, and our house stood at the peak of the steepest hill known around these parts. Folks called it the \"workout hill\" on account of the joggers who made a ritual of its ascent. With no sidewalks, the road became the path for all, pocked and treacherous underfoot or wheel. Telephone wires slung across the block sagged like old clotheslines, patched and piecemeal from the storms that raged and tore at them with impunity. The rain came often, smothering the land with its gray shroud. Tall evergreens rose sentinel-like, their presence despised for the way they blocked the ocean's view. Thus the houses climbed the hill, glass faces turned seaward, vying for the bay's embrace. At sunset, the water glowed as if lit from beneath, the sky a canvas of orange fire, though more often than not the clouds stifled the light, leaving behind a world dim and muted. In such a place, moss claimed dominion, creeping over roofs, cars, railings, until all bore its green mantle. I left my car to the elements once, and when I returned, it was a moss-cloaked monolith, demanding hours of labor to free it from nature's grip.\n\nChildren were scarce, though a school lay just a few blocks distant. The neighborhood was a bastion for the aged, those who had set aside the burdens of work. In place of children, there were dogs, a legion of them, roaming lawns and racing down streets, slipping through open doors like shadows. One found its way into my home, and I had to chase it out as one might a wayward spirit. Rabbits too ran wild, digging and burrowing, to the gardeners' despair, but my cats hunted them with a fervor born of ancient instincts. Birds flitted about, the small and the swift, with the occasional hawk or eagle passing by, only to be harried by crows until they vanished. Stores were absent, but a descent to the waterfront revealed eateries offering the sea's bounty. The shore was not one of sand but of stone, where rocks begged to be cast into the bay's embrace. The bay itself was a narrow expanse, the far shore visible even through the mist's persistent veil.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, a place you won’t find hard to reach. Public transport runs like a lifeline through the city, a pulse in the arteries of New York, and there you'll find yourself still steeped in the urban sprawl. Walk these streets and see the Asian markets sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. Two decades have drawn them here, their presence felt in every block, every corner. Supermarkets and laundromats dominion. The locals, they favor them for the food is rich and the prices kinder and the convenience a godsend. Four Asian supermarkets lie just a stone's throw from where I stand, clustered together like kinfolk. Convenience, they call it, this nearness of grocery within arm's reach.\n\nStill, Bensonhurst is not all Asian faces. A mosaic, this place, of immigrants and their children, first and second generations finding their place under the sun. The great businesses, the ones that draw the eye, are theirs. And close by, a park remade anew, with ten courts for basketball, a broad field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings and a playground for the young ones. A fountain too, where children laugh and splash away summer's heat. Parks, like the city, are a tapestry of faces and colors, woven together in play.\n\nThe skyline here is low, no towering corporate monoliths. Co-ops and condos rise up, but mostly homes built for two families, neighbors close enough to hear the hum of life. The people, they are kind enough but noisy. Cars drive by with music loud enough to rattle windows and engines revving like a call to arms, waking you with the morning light.\n\nNight brings its own counsel. The streets are mostly safe, but dark corners breed uncertainty. You might encounter those with mischief in their eyes, bullies and thieves who take what isn’t theirs. I’ve felt their fists before, long ago, and more recent still are the hands that steal packages from steps. And then there are the dogs and their masters who care not for the law. Fines do nothing to mend what is broken in them. A morning walk is a dance around the waste they leave, a nuisance that grates upon the soul. Mind your shoes as you make your way.",
            "The first thing to reckon with about Portland, Oregon is the notion of what it means to be \"weird\". A mural scrawled across a building's backside, housing a pizza joint and a bar and a music hall and a strip club, each flirting with the fringes of legality, declares \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a plea to recall the Portland from the nineties and early aughts, a city less renowned and less dear, a crucible of creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is now a badge of honor. Despite the tide of prosperous Californians and the ceaseless rise of condominiums to harbor them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weird doesn't mean always embracing, but it means a tolerance for the unordinary. Weird doesn't mean we're devoid of modernities nor struggles. Like the rest of the nation, our wares mostly hail from China. There are multitudes of ways to be weird, to be unorthodox, and yet Portland has its fill of the ordinary. It has yoga and hipsters and buttoned-down professionals. Perhaps weird means we hold all these with a looser grip. In my quarter, as in many of Portland's quarters, houses bloom in color, gardens blossom with flowers and herbs and vegetables along the lanes, and in summer, free boxes appear. These free boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items cast away by their owners but waiting to be claimed by passersby. They hold a magic, a serendipity, offering treasures perfect for the one who happens upon them. Clothes and books are common finds, though the contents can be anything. The enchantment of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of what Portland means to me, though I am but one shade of weird among countless others. Some among us would never dream of clothing themselves from a box on the curb. Those folk attend goat yoga—yes, yoga amidst goats—or cheer at the Timbers' soccer matches. Portland abounds with folk devoted to all manner of pursuits. It abounds with folk chasing dreams, or dreaming of the chase while spending hours at the bar. Indeed, Portland grapples with a drug problem. Such troubles often root in the soil of mental health, and the unending rain, the somber clouds, surely have a hand in it. Homelessness haunts us too, an enigma resisted by all. The homeless come drawn by Portland's services, kinder than most, though still wanting, as they are everywhere. The housed sway between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stood like sentinels, immutable in the north where they bore witness to the sun’s eternal passage. Each dawn, each dusk, they watched as if the great orb's journey were no more than the turning of a wheel. I could forget them in the clamor of days, in the weight of work and the clutches of life, yet still they remained, patient and indifferent to the fleeting troubles of men. On days when the world crowded in and pressed heavy upon me, they called out, and I would turn to them. They offered solace to a weary soul, strength enough to face the coming day. I first came to this place as a youth, drawn by the university and its promise of knowledge. Yet it was the mountains north of the campus that seized my heart. The university boasted its own wonders, with its stately buildings and tranquil ponds and trees that whispered of time and seasons. These too claimed a part of me, but it was the mountains that held sway. The town lay beneath them, beautiful in its own right. Countless cafés became my refuge, where hours of study found fuel in endless cups of coffee. A short walk or bus ride brought one to the heart of downtown, where faded bricks lined streets and spoke of years gone by. Here, the town shed its suburban skin, bustling with the vigor of its urban neighbors, though the clamor ebbed away within a few blocks. Beyond the library, serenity awaited, the town's quiet soul. This juxtaposition of life and stillness lent the city a certain magic, a siren song that promised discovery. In such a place, memories wove themselves into the fabric of the streets. Nights spent with friends beneath the rusted swings in the park, or rushing through the crowd to catch a film at the theater, a gift from the university. Yet the city held its share of sorrow, as all places must. The ponds, their surfaces mirrored the sky, a fitting stage for reflection or midnight tears. In the midst of an existential dread, I found myself there often. Watching the turtles and ducks and insects, each carrying out its simple purpose, I questioned my own. I wandered past the pond, through the park, past neat little houses that spoke of suburban life, until the main street opened before me. The sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I looked up, I saw the north stretched before me. There they were, as they had always been. The mountains, steadfast and eternal, brushed against the blue and yellow heavens, towering over all. In their silent majesty, they stirred within me a sense of resolve, a whisper of endurance that would not be silenced.",
            "You might pass it by without a second look. A place that doesn't catch the eye, hidden in the folds of a quiet town, tucked behind the tired facades of a shopping strip. The kind of place that seems unlikely for living, where folks wouldn't choose to settle. And yet, beyond the husk of an old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty but for the once-a-year gatherings of kin in summer's warm embrace, lies a community alive and unsung. Streets lined with apartments, each complex a part of a larger whole, like Russian dolls that have been meticulously laid out side by side, their secrets whispered to those who know where to listen. The first set of apartments has seen its share of scandal, tales told in hushed voices, tales that paint a picture darker than the truth. But beyond, a different world breathes, unknown to the many who dwell in these parts. Across from these sentinels of life stands the quiet campus of a community college, its buildings watching over the road. Students shuffle in with steaming cups as day breaks, their eyes heavy with the promise of knowledge, while the iron gates groan in welcome. Commuters scowl from their cars, impatient with the slow procession of those seeking enlightenment. The road splits then, one path leading to a park where laughter echoes, and the other to a place of healing, where broken bodies mend. The center speaks of comfort, with its inviting porches and whispering fans that stir the heavy air. Children race across the park, their limbs a blur of joy among the tall grass, bees dancing lazily in the blossoms. Elderly folks walk their dogs, casting disapproving glances at the youth who skate with abandon, while clusters of girls share secrets by the swings. Nearby, a strip mall offers its own quiet tales. A sushi joint with fare that's good but seldom sought, a shop selling summer's promise in swimming gear, and a salon where nails find their gloss. Here, one could linger, juggling life's small pleasures—a pool's cool embrace, a touch of polish, a plate of hibachi. Even a place to find frozen delight, sweet and cold in the hands of teens who ride the edge of recklessness under the southern sun. This neighborhood, a small reflection of the nation's heart, a snapshot of the enduring South where time slips by like the gentle flow of a river, unchanged and unchanging.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawling under the wide and open sky, the houses lined up like quiet sentinels of a bygone dream. Most were homes for single families, yet some had been cleaved in two, standing side by side as if unsure of their own symmetry. My own stood with its small yard and its slender driveway, a relic of an era when the suburbs whispered promises of the American dream. Once, this dream embraced the land and its people, but now it drifts like smoke. Still, the neighborhood endures, its voice a distant echo of hope, speaking to those who wander its streets that the dream holds on by a thread.\n\nThe folks here, their optimism has faded like the paint on the picket fences, the yards not tended as they once were. Yet cars remain parked in driveways, and the children play in the streets as if the world they knew was the only world that mattered. The old schoolhouse, nearly ninety years in its standing, breathes life into the young and churns up memories for the old. Churches are sparse, mostly hollowed out, yet the courts are alive with the sound of leather against pavement.\n\nEach home wears a different face, yet they share a common soul. There is the supermarket called Super \"A,\" its aisles watched over by a Yemeni family, perhaps the sole Arab presence in these parts. Most here are African American, their roots deep in the earth of this place. The streets are wide, and the children's games pause only for the passing of cars. Many families have been here for generations, their stories woven into the fabric of the past where all knew each other by name.\n\nThere was a karate school once, but Hollywood turned away from such dreams, and now it is a pharmacy, for some say pills soothe where dreams cannot. A small theater still stands, offering old films at a price that draws the elders but leaves the young unmoved. An expressway cuts through the town, its exits beyond our borders. Once, there was a clamor for an exit here, the young in favor, the old against. They said it would spoil the town, and in the end, the city council listened to their quiet wisdom.\n\nThey're raising a new high school now, and we ponder a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin might just capture the heart of this place.",
            "The city sprawls in its vastness, a tapestry of lives interwoven yet distinct. Here, where the streets wind erratically among towers of commerce, life unfolds in a patchwork of humanity. Offices stand in rows like sentinels, their windows darkened by the shadows of monoliths. Shops and eateries abound, each a world unto itself, drawing wanderers in with the promise of sustenance or some fleeting escape. Grand emporiums of renown mark the landscape, countered by humble boutiques that cling to the city's cobbled arteries. The avenues, lined with these varied establishments, pulse with the footfalls of those who dwell within neighborhoods meant for quietude yet touched by the ever-present hum of urban life.\n\nParks, mere patches of green amidst the concrete sea, offer respite to those seeking solace beneath their boughs. Children play, their laughter echoing the innocence of days unspoiled. In this place, diversity is not a claim but a living truth. The streets tell tales of those who came from lands afar—their languages a symphony, their customs a tapestry. Here, the LGBTQ+ community finds its voice alongside the devout chants of the Orthodox, and the stories of those who fled the shadow of the Soviet Union unfold with each step taken.\n\nBeyond these streets, the city stretches further, a mosaic of enclaves each with its own identity. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—names that speak of heritage and belonging, yet the journey to each is fraught with the trials of traffic that binds the city in its relentless grip. Miles pass slowly beneath the wheels, the hours marked by the stagnant crawl of vehicles in endless procession. The irony of a city so vast is its constriction, for though the distances may be short, the passage is long and wearying.\n\nYet, they come still. The cranes rise, and new towers reach for the heavens as if the earth itself might yield more space. The city draws them in, but not without dissent. For with each new soul, the roads grow fuller, the spaces tighter. Those who have called this place home watch the change with wary eyes.\n\nIn this labyrinth, homes take many forms. Towers of glass and steel stand alongside modest dwellings, each a sanctuary for its inhabitants. Some find solace in the singular embrace of family homes, while others share walls in duplexes. The streets of my own neighborhood, a microcosm of the city itself, reveal a myriad of domiciles, each sheltering lives as varied as the cityscape. Yet, in this place of infinite variety, familiarity is a rare currency. The faces of neighbors slip by like shadows, unknown and unknowing, save for the echoes of childhood laughter that linger in the memory of games once played in the fading light of simpler days.",
            "The road stretched out through the fields of corn, endless and vast, where the horizon seemed to hold the very sky. She peered out, eyes wide, the silence of the land standing in stark contrast to the world she knew, where the grocery store was a mere stroll from her door. But here, there was only the earth, boundless and unbroken, and I told her of my Ohio, of my youth in a place where land was the measure of a man. Down the narrow road, past the quarry brimming with water that mirrored the heavens, lay the small gathering of homes where I lived. Each house, a fortress of brick and stucco, staked its claim on the earth, a half-acre of pride in every yard. In spring, the gardens burst forth, a riot of flowers beneath the weathered limbs of trees that marked the seasons with their changing hues.\n\nThe driveways shimmered with the polish of fine Mercedes, a gleam in the sun that spoke of care and labor. As I neared my gray stucco home, there was my neighbor, the Korean, always with a song on his lips and the mower's drone beneath his voice. He was a man whose years had taken some of his sharpness, yet his heart was ever true. Once a healer, now he tended his grass as diligently as he once did his patients, becoming one with the earth and his John Deere.\n\nWhen you arrive at my home, the geese are there, bold amid the grass, and our Terrier, ever the hunter, gives chase. Beyond, a stream weaves through the land, a quiet melody against the distant calls of cows. Across the bridge of wood, crafted by hand, lies a sanctuary untouched by time, where trees and wildflowers grow as they will. Here was the cradle of my childhood, a realm of forts and pursuits, where imagination ran as wild as the creatures we chased.\n\nWinter came with its own harsh beauty, casting the land in white, the living world turned to stillness. The trees stood bare, sentinels in a frozen expanse, yet when snow graced the ground, it became a canvas for angels and snowmen, the work of my sister's hands. We were warriors in those days, snowballs our weapons, forts of snow and branch our bastions. There, in our winter kingdom, we found the freedom of children, untouched by the world beyond."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, where the land stretches out in vast tapestries, lies the small town of Michigan. A place where fields yield to quaint tourist hamlets, and the notion of sprawling city malls and chains like Wal-Mart or Target remains a distant echo. Here, every journey demands the road. And yet, this is among the world's most beautiful places, flanked by waters on all sides. The town itself, cradled between the mighty Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. A place where the shoreline is never far, and the sands invite the weary to wade in.\n\nOur neighborhood speaks the language of small-town America. Homes stand apart, not pressed together like the crowded bricks of a cityscape. These are no uniform dwellings; each bears its own story. Some are old, having seen the years pass, while others wear the newness of renovation. Basements, full and visible from the street, anchor these houses, many clad in the armor of aged aluminum siding. All colors of the spectrum paint the blocks around my home, a patchwork quilt of humanity. Each house with its own little realm, yards adorned with trampolines and swing sets. Gardens bloom, fences contain the creatures that share our lives. Middle America, they call it. A place of earnest folk, toiling through the days, nurturing families or watching them grow.\n\nOn any day, children race along the streets, laughter echoing between the homes. Dogs with eager tails lead their humans on walks, bicycles roll, and rollerblades whisper over the pavement. Neighbors know each other here, woven into the fabric of community. A wave from the grill, a nod from the dog walker a few blocks down. The lawns are kept, leaves of autumn are not left to languish. Grass, green and tamed, bushes and plants trimmed and tidy. This is not a neighborhood of grandeur, but one of warmth. A place where families find solace, where the quiet and the calm weave a tapestry of safety. The kind of place where you feel the world has provided a haven at the end of the day.\n\nA short walk finds the county sheriff’s department and jail, a sentinel of order. The health department stands beside it, a bastion of care. Down the road, the city recycling center hums with purpose, serving the people diligently. Nearby, the crack of bat against ball rings out from the baseball and softball fields, the announcers' voices carrying the names of dreams through the air. The small town airport rests beyond, its engines a distant rumble as planes rise and fall from the earth. Ice cream waits in the heart of town, a sweet reward within reach. The park stands merely eight blocks from our door, a sanctuary for my children and their bikes. This place, in its quiet certainty, is a treasure. A truly fine place to call home.",
            "The place I call home lies on the margins of the city, a stretch of land caught between the whispers of the wild and the orderly hum of suburbia. Here, the hand of the homeowner's association guides all, a silent overseer ensuring that each house stands a mirror to its neighbor. The lawns, neat and trimmed, are but small patches of green, bordered by decorative stones and short driveways that speak of uniformity, of order. Each house guards a two-car garage, and the roadways, freshly laid and smooth, defy the wear of time and tread.\n\nThe homes mostly rise a single story, with the occasional two-story among them, like rare trees in a manicured forest. Gone are the solitary mailboxes that once marked each threshold; now, a cluster of metal boxes stands sentinel at street's end, keys in hand for those who seek their post, parcels tucked away in larger lockers. This, too, is the work of the association, their quest for sameness leaving no stone unturned.\n\nOn these edges where suburb meets the rural, there is space enough for all manner of things. Community pools lie within their gates, pristine and welcoming, while paths wind through the neighborhood, inviting the wanderer or the dog walker to stroll beneath the open sky. There is no need for parks here; the land itself offers room to run, to breathe.\n\nThe people who dwell here are mostly those who've seen the years pass, retirees who keep watch over the quiet streets, their vigilance a comfort to all. Yet among them, a smattering of middle-aged and young professionals find their place, bringing with them the pulse of life's earlier rhythms.\n\nBeyond, the city sprawls, a contradiction of size and intimacy. Its heart beats with the rhythm of a town both large and small, offering the amenities one might seek, though not in abundance. A mall stands modestly, sufficient in its offerings, a mere quarter-hour's drive from the neighborhood's embrace. Once arrived, a world of shops unfolds, from the high-end grocers with their organic fare to the bargain outlets, their shelves sparse and staff few.\n\nIn this place, safety and order reign. The pools and trails are but the surface of its charms, and though the shops lie a drive away, the roads lead ever onward to the chains and stores that promise all one might need. This is the world of my childhood, the shape of home.",
            "The first I knew of that place was from the voice of a stranger on a podcast, a story spun from the mysteries of the missing. The revelation was unexpected. In that quarter, apartments fetched a princely sum each month, a thousand dollars or more. Yet of this tale, neither I nor my kin had ever heard mention. Perhaps it was the struggle that kept it veiled. Nights were soaked in tears for some of my friends, the weight of expense pressing hard. But we had mastered frugality. The scent of bygone relics from the flea market came to be a comfort, the odor of mothballed garments a familiar embrace. In the years of adulthood, you notice less. Perhaps you take to smoking, or merely grow accustomed to the world’s state. Yet the market’s essence permeates all, the dusty tomes piled on a silent piano, clinging to leather long after the wash. \n\nHere, within a stone’s throw, lie three thrift stores. Begin at one edge and you traverse two charity thrifts, a library shadowed by age, a rare book emporium, and a curio shop. Downtown thrums with life, streets choked with the ceaseless flow of cars and people, yet within the thrift stores, silence reigns. A fine refuge for the afternoon’s loss. Each year, the tide of humanity swells, this city in its throes of becoming. They speak of development, the city a nexus for a vast empire of commerce and delivery, still aching with its growth. It conjures the specter of New York, each soul in pursuit of its own end, unburdened by the expectations of others. Solitude is a cherished right, independence a quiet creed, and none will intrude. Unlike the South, where concern is the currency of care, here lives remain unexamined if one wills it. The city rises and recedes like the ocean’s breath upon the shore, a vibrant tapestry. \n\nWithin the confines of my dwelling, life stirs. The pianist’s strains next door, the harmonies of singers above. Here, strangers are kin, a community forged in shared necessity. We gather for life’s markers, its joys and sorrows, lending aid where we can. Fortune has placed me here, among neighbors I cherish, who return my regard. I strive to leave no trace but kindness, sharing the bounty of my kitchen, as they do with me. We exchange letters and parcels, a ritual of connection. Their presence is a solace, and I believe mine is received likewise. In this sprawling mass of concrete and steel, it is these souls who stave off the void, who remind me that my choices have not been in vain.",
            "In the quiet heart of the Midwest, where the fields stretch out like a patchwork quilt, lies a town just beyond the reach of the city’s suburban sprawl. On its eastern fringe sits our neighborhood, perhaps the least prosperous by any measure of wealth. The homes are modest, often rented or owned by those who watch the pennies, their paint peeling beneath the sun's relentless gaze. Yet, it is a place not without its own kind of beauty, a rough-hewn charm that speaks to the soul. The folks here are kind, their greetings warm as the summer sun when you pass them by on the cracked sidewalks. Crime does not haunt us like a specter, though it has whispered its presence here in the form of violence, a shadow that slips through the darkened streets every few years. A neighbor’s boy fell to a gun’s bark outside the neon haze of a bar last year, the echoes of that night still linger, like a mournful wind through the trees. Our family, by some grace, has been spared such direct sorrow save for the odd possession vanished from our porch, forgotten to be brought inside.\n\nThis town of ours, like so many others across the vast expanse of this land, bears the deep scars of an epidemic. The opioid crisis has cut a swath, leaving in its wake those who have succumbed to the siren call of fentanyl. Yet there are those who fight against the tide, places of healing and hope, where the afflicted seek redemption, and others learn to wield Narcan like a shield against despair. \n\nIn the midst of these tribulations, there blooms much that is good. My son’s school, a haven of learning and laughter, stands as a testament to what can be achieved even in trying times. The teachers there, from principal down to the support staff, are pillars of strength and kindness. That he has never been the target of cruelty despite his needs is a blessing, testament to the nurturing soil of that place. The PTO, vibrant and alive, orchestrates moments of joy and learning, drawing families into the fold. Here, where poverty humbles more than a fifth of our people, no child knows the pangs of hunger at school. Meals are given freely, and dignity is preserved amidst the struggle. The city fathers have turned their gaze upon the town's image, paving roads, tending to parks, though their focus leans westward where commerce thrives and the traffic flows. Our side of town remains in waiting, a fact not lost on those of us who call it home.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, this town holds us in its embrace. The people, the schools, the shops that line the streets—they meet our needs. Our home, humble though it may be, is a sanctuary, its worth measured not in dollars but in memories. Sixteen years we have dwelled here, and in all the vastness of the world, there is no other place we would call our own.",
            "The neighborhood sits upon a hill, its streets winding their way between buildings that whisper tales of history to those who listen. It is a place of culture, where the past and present collide in the shadows of the old live theater that stands across from my seven-story apartment building. Down the slope, a humble block away, lies an arcade bar, a haven for souls adrift in the warm breath of summer nights. In the heat of June and July, a line of eager faces stretches along the pavement, waiting for entry, chasing the promise of laughter and light.\n\nAbove, the city park sprawls, an expanse of green in a quarter where space is a luxury. Concrete encircles it like a fortress wall, its surface broken by the jagged teeth of stairs carved into its face. When winter's chill descends, the homeless gather, their tents a patchwork quilt upon the sidewalk and steps, seeking refuge from the rain's relentless assault. It is a hard life, lived in proximity to the family center where warmth and water can be found.\n\nYet, it is not the proud architecture nor the storied structures that capture my heart, but the soul of the people who tread these streets. Hilltop, once a name spoken in fear, echoes with stories of days when the air was thick with the presence of federal agents and the DEA, sweeping through like a cleansing storm. The people remember, and the tales pass from lip to ear, generation to generation, until they reach even newcomers like me. The spirit here is one of resilience, a determination to reclaim and redefine.\n\nThey say the Hill is no place for a white face after dark, a warning born of old fears and misconceptions. But perhaps it is my skin, dark enough to blend, or perhaps the Hilltop recognizes its own in me, one who sees the threads of racism and fear woven into the fabric of our nation. Here, in this so-called cultural utopia, I find a home. The streets pulse with life beneath my feet, each step a testament to the kindness that resides in unexpected places.\n\nWalking these streets at night, I have been met not with malice but with generosity, offered warmth instead of harm. The laundromat owner who keeps the lights on for me, the stranger who presses a crumpled bill into my hand, seeing value where I saw none. These are the moments that bind me to this place, knit me into its story. Hilltop is more than a neighborhood; it is a testament to the enduring spirit of its people, a reminder that home is found in the hearts of those who walk beside you.",
            "I came to this place when the world was just beginning to open its doors to me, the eighth grade looming like a distant horizon. At first, the air was thick with unfamiliarity, the faces all strange and distant. But in time, as it will, the world shifted. I found kinship in the boy two doors down and another lad who called my street home. They've since wandered on, as people do, but their echoes remain etched into the fabric of this place. Most who were here at my coming still tread the same paths, ghosts of their younger selves. The neighborhood, a reflection of the American dream, sprawls with its two-story houses standing sentinel. The weekends bring a symphony of youthful exuberance, the laughter and shouts of children caught in the warmth of the sun. Silence hangs over the weekdays like a shroud. We've all kept our peace here, no quarrels to speak of. Solitude is the norm unless a hand is needed. The parcels I've ordered have always found their way unmolested, a testament to the trust that binds this place. A park lies but a stone's throw from my door, and in it, a tapestry of memories, both bright and shadowed. We've played the games of youth there, my companions and I, until the day the world turned red with pain from an errant elbow. But even that memory fades beneath the weight of joyous days. Now, it is the realm of my cousin's children, their laughter a bridge to my past, their delight in swings and slides a mirror to my own gone days. The park is a vessel of nostalgia, a keeper of time. Here, the world converges in its diversity, each face a story, each dish a journey. Within a mile's reach, flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy whisper their tales. Yet, in these times, many choose the path of least resistance, letting the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash bring the world to their doorsteps. Fast food reigns as king, a staple of suburban life, with pizza places dotting the map like stars. The stores hold all one might need, a Walgreens and CVS standing guard, alongside Jewel-Osco, a familiar name in the Midwest. Even here, the world finds its way in, an Indian shop offering a taste of home or adventure. In all, I find solace in this neighborhood. The tales of woe and strife I hear from afar serve only to deepen my gratitude for the peace I know here.",
            "The neighborhood I call home rests in close proximity to the college, a fact that lends a certain convenience to my days. The landscape is dotted with apartment buildings, their facades worn with time, and among them, a scattering of restaurants and bars that beckon with modest charms and costs. One of these bars, now bearing a new name, demands a heavier toll for its libations, yet its offerings are not the worst one might endure. The people, mostly students and those of lesser means, find their refuge here, the rent not beyond reach. Children roam, their laughter carried on the air from the nearby school, a stone's throw from my abode.\n\nThe faces of my neighbors remain a mystery, a distance I find suitable. Their penchant for smoke has summoned a fragrant retribution from the building's overseers, an air freshener planted like a sentinel at their door, a jest shared in quiet amusement with my companion. These structures, aged in visage, might conceal interiors touched by modern hands. Down the way, new apartments rise, their construction a flimsy artifice betrayed by exorbitant rents, a ruse abetted by their nearness to the campus grounds.\n\nA humble eatery lies but five minutes' walk, its fare served on paper, warmed by the hum of machinery. Across the way, a gas station stands, its reputation as an employer shadowed by whispers. Yet, the city’s coin has brought fresh roads, wide sidewalks, and green upon medians, a veneer of civility. My own dwelling finds itself cloaked in trees, save for stumps where some were felled. Behind lies a line of trees, beyond which another set of apartments stands. I reside on 42nd street, while the next, 43rd, shows the wear of years, its sidewalks crumbling, its buildings cloaked in neglect, the trees a screen against the eyes.\n\nCrime has its haunt on that thoroughfare, though blame does not rest solely there. Across from me, too, the shadows linger, a transient tide flowing through. Still, I find a contentment in this place. It suits my purse and offers what I need. The university, a short walk away, and the buses, ready to carry me to the heart of the city or to the store, make life here more than bearable.",
            "In the elbow of the road where the cul-de-sac bends, the duplexes stand like solitary houses, their yellow skin, white porches, and green metal roofs under the expansive sky. Folks here, almost kin in their quiet camaraderie, gather by the driveways as the sun dips low, the children weaving dreams from chalk and kite string. The air, thick with the scent of the earth and the chatter of neighbors, feels untouched by the clamor of the world beyond. Fields and trees cradle us, the sky a canvas of blue and white.  \n\nYet, this season, the air carries whispers of storms, the threats of tornadoes. Last night, the sirens wailed, their call cutting through the dusk, and I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my littlest dog, a purse, and a few pillows. The big dog stayed out in the living room, his bark echoing the thrum of the hail that pelted the earth. Outside, the world seemed to hold its breath, the storm's aftermath leaving the road steaming, the temperature plummeting from 92 to 75 in a heartbeat. The hail, hot against the pavement, melted swiftly, and as the skies cleared, a double rainbow arched across the horizon. I seized my camera, capturing the marvel to share with distant kin and companions, their awe mirroring my own.\n\nThe streets lay hushed for an hour before life resumed its rhythm, children and mothers emerging as the fragrance of dinners wafted from open windows. For a northerner newly settled in the South, this neighborhood is a balm, the lilt of southern voices a melody to my ears. Each duplex, a mirror of the next, holds its secrets within, rooms of varying dimensions behind identical facades. I often wander to the broad field behind us, tracing the path to the pond where the deer tread softly and the bullfrog's song greets the dawn. Just forty minutes from Charlotte, it feels a world away, roosters heralding the morning from nearby farms. And as night falls, the bray of a donkey from a distant farm reminds us of our place in this patch of earth. This neighborhood is a found treasure, nestled in the heart of the world.",
            "The years have passed in this place and I reckon I’ve come to know it some. At first, I was filled with a kind of sorrow when we left the streets of Riverdale behind. I cried for what was gone, for the kin and the kind I had known there. My folks, they had the notion to find a better life for me and my sister, so we moved on to Stockbridge where the schools and the houses were finer, where the air seemed less filled with the ghosts of the old life. Time carried on and I made new friends there and some enemies too, as one does. The neighbors were mostly strangers to me save for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived close by. They became like family, a comfort I came to value. I remember the day when we all went to Mr. Glen’s wedding, this remarrying of his with Ms. Veda. A day filled with laughter and promise. I caught the garter she tossed, but the flowers eluded me. We danced long into the night and I remember that time with Marsharii, their daughter, though she has since gone her own way. I hope the world has treated her well. The neighborhood is a tangle, a labyrinth of streets and stories, but with a GPS now I’ve explored deeper. My friends Kason and Curtis and I would wander and play, losing ourselves in the games of youth, seeking joy wherever it was to be found. Sometimes I would take to the park, where the quiet of nature would settle in me, a balm for the restless soul. I’d balance on sticks or wield my wooden sword, finding solace in these small pleasures. There are courts for tennis and basketball, though I’ve not played in some time, taught by my father and Mr. Graves who worked us hard but filled those days with laughter. This place has held many a memory, each one etched into the time spent here, and I reckon the finest are yet to come.",
            "The town lay quiet under the South Carolina sun, a small place not unlike others but known far and wide for the peaches that grew in its soil. Johnston, they called it, and the sign as you entered spoke proudly of it being the Peach Capital of the World. Farmlands stretched out on every side, rows of peach trees and cattle grazing in the fields. Houses stood some distance apart, their metal roofs glinting against the summer's heat, or gray shingles weathered and old. They were set back from the road, leaving the land before them open for crops and beasts.\n\nIn the heart of the town hung a solitary stoplight above the four-way, beneath which lay the few stores that served the people. A Chinese place, Hong Kong, run by a family, and Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, where you could get a burger to go. There had been a pizzeria once, but it shut its doors not long ago. A small pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, offered more than medicine, known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sold. \n\nThe grocer, IGA, was the only one in town, but folks often drove to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main shopping. Dollar General was where the people came, a small store bustling from dawn to dusk, shelves laden with the needs of everyday life. A furniture place, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman whose name everyone knew, stood with its doors open, employing two men to deliver what was bought. Next to it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels offered care for the animals, grooming and boarding and such.\n\nThere were small practices for doctoring and veterinary needs, both away from the main street but capable enough for Johnston's needs. Johnston Elementary was the school, and after the fifth grade, the children moved on to the next town for further schooling. There was no park in Johnston, though they talked of making a space for families and visitors, a place of 2.5 acres where life might find some leisure.\n\nThere were no cinemas or alleys for bowling, no place for the young to gather, no playgrounds for the children, nor paths for walking the dogs. The eateries were few and far between. But it was a town of its own, small enough that one might miss it if they didn't slow down to look, passing by with just a blink and it would be gone.",
            "In a small southern town of Tennessee, there’s a stretch of suburbia where I have made my home. The street runs between two state highways, a ribbon of asphalt that carries more traffic than I’d care for, though the neighborhood itself keeps mostly to its own quiet rhythms. Folks here do not come and go with much frequency, and so the faces have become familiar, like the slow turn of seasons. Yard work occupies the hands of the people, and the days pass with the hum of lawnmowers from March to October, a constant chorus beneath the green canopy that shades us. In winter, such as it is, we sled down the hill, though winter has grown thin, more of a long autumn now.\n\nOur house stands at the street’s corner, a sentry watching all who pass, and we know the parade of cars by their daily ritual. A strange vehicle catches our eye, an anomaly in the habitual landscape. The neighbors walk their dogs, children ride their bicycles, and life unspools as one would expect. We dwell here, my wife and I, with our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. Our comings and goings are part of the neighborhood’s fabric, as we work from home, stepping out to play even in the rain’s embrace.\n\nOn occasion, the grill on our back deck sends forth the scent of barbecue, a fragrant signal of time well spent. The trees, remnants of a forest long subdued, offer shade and a bounty of leaves come autumn. The smoke of burning leaves, a perfume of the season’s turning, is a welcome herald of fall’s arrival.\n\nThe garage is my sanctuary at the house’s rear, a place for the truck and small projects. With doors open, I feel the pulse of the street, the heartbeat of the neighborhood. Holidays bring a hush, save for the influx of cars during Thanksgiving or the like, when families gather and the street fills with the presence of those from afar. \n\nHere, in this place, I find contentment. Perfect it is not, for the road draws traffic, yet it is home, and I have come to love it as one loves the flawed and familiar.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where the earth swells in barren waves of dust and grit, lies my neighborhood. A land of endless brown, the kind that seeps into your bones until even the notion of green feels foreign. If one were to stumble upon a patch of lawn, it stands not as a testament to nature but to the wallet of its keeper. When I first set roots here back in the nineties, the houses were scattered like lone sentinels across the desolate expanse. Time has drawn them closer, though the land still stretches wide with new growth creeping in like tendrils of some slow, creeping vine. This place takes on the guise of a city, yet it remains caught between worlds, shifting and changing as all places do with the passage of years.\n\nThe folks here, they're good people mostly, though like in any cluster of humanity, you've your saints and your sinners. My corner of the world, it's a haven of kindly elders, a quieter enclave amidst the expanse. Chain stores dot the landscape, names familiar to all—Food For Less, Smart and Final. For something finer, a journey is required, as stores like Whole Foods are but whispers on the wind here. Construction is the lifeblood of this city, not that numbers would tell you, but the wide-open spaces lay ready for the hammer and nail. It unsettles me some, this constant build and change. I fled the sprawl of a great city once and have no mind to return. My trade is among these builders; I ply my hands in drywall and T-bar, a craftsman shaping the bones of new abodes.\n\nThe desert's stark beauty draws many, a vast tapestry of rugged life where creatures eke out an existence in the harsh embrace of the land. We who dwell here have learned the ways of our fellow denizens: lizards and insects that scuttle across the sands. My three children, wild with the wonder of youth, spend their days in pursuit of these desert denizens, gathering them like treasures in the palms of their hands.\n\nThis place has its lures, and for those who seek them, they are here to be found. Victorville stands as a gateway to a different kind of existence. Each year, the San Bernardino County Fair breathes life into the desert, a carnival of laughter and light. And should you wander further, Wrightwood awaits with its snow-capped peaks, offering the promise of winter's chill and the thrill of sport. For those with a mind to learn of the land's history, the Victor Valley Museum holds tales of stone and bone, of those who walked here long before the world was as it is now.\n\nIn this place of dust and dreams, we carve out our days, each one a thread in the tapestry of this desert life.",
            "In the telling of my neighborhood, there is a strangeness to the tale that might not find its echo in the stories of others. Where others might speak of streets lined with houses and lives lived behind closed doors, mine is the tale of a campus that sprawls like a quiet testament to learning, and of a dormitory that whispers its secrets in the hush of night. This is my neighborhood, with its peculiar rhythms and its own quiet cadences. \n\nThis place, this campus, is a constellation of houses. There are the apartments, each a small world unto itself, holding within its walls two to four souls, lives interwoven, and stories shared. Each building rises but two floors, twenty lives suspended therein, like stars in a firmament. Then there are the houses, scattered and few, standing like sentinels in the landscape, offering shelter to those with ties to the school, alumni who linger in the embrace of their old haunt. And then, the dormitories, vast and cavernous, where hundreds of students find their rest, two to a room, sometimes more, the hum of their lives a quiet symphony in the night.\n\nThe people here are a tapestry of color and culture, each thread a unique hue, weaving a narrative that is rich and varied. They come from places far and wide, the professional staff finding their refuge in the scattered houses, the new students in the dormitories, and the older ones in apartments, each finding their place in this communal dance.\n\nThe heart of this neighborhood beats with the rhythm of its stores and its solitary park. The shops offer a bounty of choices, dining options that speak of the world beyond these walls, and the school's own peculiar offerings of clothing and sustenance. It is a place where the needs of life can be met without ever leaving its bounds. And the park, a green sanctuary in the midst of it all, a playground for the diverse souls who call this place home, kept clean and safe by the unseen hands of its community.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, a place woven from the threads of lives lived in proximity and purpose, a world unto itself.",
            "There were no sidewalks to speak of where I lived. Everything leaned toward the earth's pull, and our house stood at the peak of the steepest hill known around these parts. Folks called it the \"workout hill\" on account of the joggers who made a ritual of its ascent. With no sidewalks, the road became the path for all, pocked and treacherous underfoot or wheel. Telephone wires slung across the block sagged like old clotheslines, patched and piecemeal from the storms that raged and tore at them with impunity. The rain came often, smothering the land with its gray shroud. Tall evergreens rose sentinel-like, their presence despised for the way they blocked the ocean's view. Thus the houses climbed the hill, glass faces turned seaward, vying for the bay's embrace. At sunset, the water glowed as if lit from beneath, the sky a canvas of orange fire, though more often than not the clouds stifled the light, leaving behind a world dim and muted. In such a place, moss claimed dominion, creeping over roofs, cars, railings, until all bore its green mantle. I left my car to the elements once, and when I returned, it was a moss-cloaked monolith, demanding hours of labor to free it from nature's grip.\n\nChildren were scarce, though a school lay just a few blocks distant. The neighborhood was a bastion for the aged, those who had set aside the burdens of work. In place of children, there were dogs, a legion of them, roaming lawns and racing down streets, slipping through open doors like shadows. One found its way into my home, and I had to chase it out as one might a wayward spirit. Rabbits too ran wild, digging and burrowing, to the gardeners' despair, but my cats hunted them with a fervor born of ancient instincts. Birds flitted about, the small and the swift, with the occasional hawk or eagle passing by, only to be harried by crows until they vanished. Stores were absent, but a descent to the waterfront revealed eateries offering the sea's bounty. The shore was not one of sand but of stone, where rocks begged to be cast into the bay's embrace. The bay itself was a narrow expanse, the far shore visible even through the mist's persistent veil.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, a place you won’t find hard to reach. Public transport runs like a lifeline through the city, a pulse in the arteries of New York, and there you'll find yourself still steeped in the urban sprawl. Walk these streets and see the Asian markets sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. Two decades have drawn them here, their presence felt in every block, every corner. Supermarkets and laundromats dominion. The locals, they favor them for the food is rich and the prices kinder and the convenience a godsend. Four Asian supermarkets lie just a stone's throw from where I stand, clustered together like kinfolk. Convenience, they call it, this nearness of grocery within arm's reach.\n\nStill, Bensonhurst is not all Asian faces. A mosaic, this place, of immigrants and their children, first and second generations finding their place under the sun. The great businesses, the ones that draw the eye, are theirs. And close by, a park remade anew, with ten courts for basketball, a broad field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings and a playground for the young ones. A fountain too, where children laugh and splash away summer's heat. Parks, like the city, are a tapestry of faces and colors, woven together in play.\n\nThe skyline here is low, no towering corporate monoliths. Co-ops and condos rise up, but mostly homes built for two families, neighbors close enough to hear the hum of life. The people, they are kind enough but noisy. Cars drive by with music loud enough to rattle windows and engines revving like a call to arms, waking you with the morning light.\n\nNight brings its own counsel. The streets are mostly safe, but dark corners breed uncertainty. You might encounter those with mischief in their eyes, bullies and thieves who take what isn’t theirs. I’ve felt their fists before, long ago, and more recent still are the hands that steal packages from steps. And then there are the dogs and their masters who care not for the law. Fines do nothing to mend what is broken in them. A morning walk is a dance around the waste they leave, a nuisance that grates upon the soul. Mind your shoes as you make your way.",
            "The first thing to reckon with about Portland, Oregon is the notion of what it means to be \"weird\". A mural scrawled across a building's backside, housing a pizza joint and a bar and a music hall and a strip club, each flirting with the fringes of legality, declares \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a plea to recall the Portland from the nineties and early aughts, a city less renowned and less dear, a crucible of creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is now a badge of honor. Despite the tide of prosperous Californians and the ceaseless rise of condominiums to harbor them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weird doesn't mean always embracing, but it means a tolerance for the unordinary. Weird doesn't mean we're devoid of modernities nor struggles. Like the rest of the nation, our wares mostly hail from China. There are multitudes of ways to be weird, to be unorthodox, and yet Portland has its fill of the ordinary. It has yoga and hipsters and buttoned-down professionals. Perhaps weird means we hold all these with a looser grip. In my quarter, as in many of Portland's quarters, houses bloom in color, gardens blossom with flowers and herbs and vegetables along the lanes, and in summer, free boxes appear. These free boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items cast away by their owners but waiting to be claimed by passersby. They hold a magic, a serendipity, offering treasures perfect for the one who happens upon them. Clothes and books are common finds, though the contents can be anything. The enchantment of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of what Portland means to me, though I am but one shade of weird among countless others. Some among us would never dream of clothing themselves from a box on the curb. Those folk attend goat yoga—yes, yoga amidst goats—or cheer at the Timbers' soccer matches. Portland abounds with folk devoted to all manner of pursuits. It abounds with folk chasing dreams, or dreaming of the chase while spending hours at the bar. Indeed, Portland grapples with a drug problem. Such troubles often root in the soil of mental health, and the unending rain, the somber clouds, surely have a hand in it. Homelessness haunts us too, an enigma resisted by all. The homeless come drawn by Portland's services, kinder than most, though still wanting, as they are everywhere. The housed sway between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stood like sentinels, immutable in the north where they bore witness to the sun’s eternal passage. Each dawn, each dusk, they watched as if the great orb's journey were no more than the turning of a wheel. I could forget them in the clamor of days, in the weight of work and the clutches of life, yet still they remained, patient and indifferent to the fleeting troubles of men. On days when the world crowded in and pressed heavy upon me, they called out, and I would turn to them. They offered solace to a weary soul, strength enough to face the coming day. I first came to this place as a youth, drawn by the university and its promise of knowledge. Yet it was the mountains north of the campus that seized my heart. The university boasted its own wonders, with its stately buildings and tranquil ponds and trees that whispered of time and seasons. These too claimed a part of me, but it was the mountains that held sway. The town lay beneath them, beautiful in its own right. Countless cafés became my refuge, where hours of study found fuel in endless cups of coffee. A short walk or bus ride brought one to the heart of downtown, where faded bricks lined streets and spoke of years gone by. Here, the town shed its suburban skin, bustling with the vigor of its urban neighbors, though the clamor ebbed away within a few blocks. Beyond the library, serenity awaited, the town's quiet soul. This juxtaposition of life and stillness lent the city a certain magic, a siren song that promised discovery. In such a place, memories wove themselves into the fabric of the streets. Nights spent with friends beneath the rusted swings in the park, or rushing through the crowd to catch a film at the theater, a gift from the university. Yet the city held its share of sorrow, as all places must. The ponds, their surfaces mirrored the sky, a fitting stage for reflection or midnight tears. In the midst of an existential dread, I found myself there often. Watching the turtles and ducks and insects, each carrying out its simple purpose, I questioned my own. I wandered past the pond, through the park, past neat little houses that spoke of suburban life, until the main street opened before me. The sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I looked up, I saw the north stretched before me. There they were, as they had always been. The mountains, steadfast and eternal, brushed against the blue and yellow heavens, towering over all. In their silent majesty, they stirred within me a sense of resolve, a whisper of endurance that would not be silenced.",
            "You might pass it by without a second look. A place that doesn't catch the eye, hidden in the folds of a quiet town, tucked behind the tired facades of a shopping strip. The kind of place that seems unlikely for living, where folks wouldn't choose to settle. And yet, beyond the husk of an old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty but for the once-a-year gatherings of kin in summer's warm embrace, lies a community alive and unsung. Streets lined with apartments, each complex a part of a larger whole, like Russian dolls that have been meticulously laid out side by side, their secrets whispered to those who know where to listen. The first set of apartments has seen its share of scandal, tales told in hushed voices, tales that paint a picture darker than the truth. But beyond, a different world breathes, unknown to the many who dwell in these parts. Across from these sentinels of life stands the quiet campus of a community college, its buildings watching over the road. Students shuffle in with steaming cups as day breaks, their eyes heavy with the promise of knowledge, while the iron gates groan in welcome. Commuters scowl from their cars, impatient with the slow procession of those seeking enlightenment. The road splits then, one path leading to a park where laughter echoes, and the other to a place of healing, where broken bodies mend. The center speaks of comfort, with its inviting porches and whispering fans that stir the heavy air. Children race across the park, their limbs a blur of joy among the tall grass, bees dancing lazily in the blossoms. Elderly folks walk their dogs, casting disapproving glances at the youth who skate with abandon, while clusters of girls share secrets by the swings. Nearby, a strip mall offers its own quiet tales. A sushi joint with fare that's good but seldom sought, a shop selling summer's promise in swimming gear, and a salon where nails find their gloss. Here, one could linger, juggling life's small pleasures—a pool's cool embrace, a touch of polish, a plate of hibachi. Even a place to find frozen delight, sweet and cold in the hands of teens who ride the edge of recklessness under the southern sun. This neighborhood, a small reflection of the nation's heart, a snapshot of the enduring South where time slips by like the gentle flow of a river, unchanged and unchanging.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawling under the wide and open sky, the houses lined up like quiet sentinels of a bygone dream. Most were homes for single families, yet some had been cleaved in two, standing side by side as if unsure of their own symmetry. My own stood with its small yard and its slender driveway, a relic of an era when the suburbs whispered promises of the American dream. Once, this dream embraced the land and its people, but now it drifts like smoke. Still, the neighborhood endures, its voice a distant echo of hope, speaking to those who wander its streets that the dream holds on by a thread.\n\nThe folks here, their optimism has faded like the paint on the picket fences, the yards not tended as they once were. Yet cars remain parked in driveways, and the children play in the streets as if the world they knew was the only world that mattered. The old schoolhouse, nearly ninety years in its standing, breathes life into the young and churns up memories for the old. Churches are sparse, mostly hollowed out, yet the courts are alive with the sound of leather against pavement.\n\nEach home wears a different face, yet they share a common soul. There is the supermarket called Super \"A,\" its aisles watched over by a Yemeni family, perhaps the sole Arab presence in these parts. Most here are African American, their roots deep in the earth of this place. The streets are wide, and the children's games pause only for the passing of cars. Many families have been here for generations, their stories woven into the fabric of the past where all knew each other by name.\n\nThere was a karate school once, but Hollywood turned away from such dreams, and now it is a pharmacy, for some say pills soothe where dreams cannot. A small theater still stands, offering old films at a price that draws the elders but leaves the young unmoved. An expressway cuts through the town, its exits beyond our borders. Once, there was a clamor for an exit here, the young in favor, the old against. They said it would spoil the town, and in the end, the city council listened to their quiet wisdom.\n\nThey're raising a new high school now, and we ponder a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin might just capture the heart of this place.",
            "The city sprawls in its vastness, a tapestry of lives interwoven yet distinct. Here, where the streets wind erratically among towers of commerce, life unfolds in a patchwork of humanity. Offices stand in rows like sentinels, their windows darkened by the shadows of monoliths. Shops and eateries abound, each a world unto itself, drawing wanderers in with the promise of sustenance or some fleeting escape. Grand emporiums of renown mark the landscape, countered by humble boutiques that cling to the city's cobbled arteries. The avenues, lined with these varied establishments, pulse with the footfalls of those who dwell within neighborhoods meant for quietude yet touched by the ever-present hum of urban life.\n\nParks, mere patches of green amidst the concrete sea, offer respite to those seeking solace beneath their boughs. Children play, their laughter echoing the innocence of days unspoiled. In this place, diversity is not a claim but a living truth. The streets tell tales of those who came from lands afar—their languages a symphony, their customs a tapestry. Here, the LGBTQ+ community finds its voice alongside the devout chants of the Orthodox, and the stories of those who fled the shadow of the Soviet Union unfold with each step taken.\n\nBeyond these streets, the city stretches further, a mosaic of enclaves each with its own identity. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—names that speak of heritage and belonging, yet the journey to each is fraught with the trials of traffic that binds the city in its relentless grip. Miles pass slowly beneath the wheels, the hours marked by the stagnant crawl of vehicles in endless procession. The irony of a city so vast is its constriction, for though the distances may be short, the passage is long and wearying.\n\nYet, they come still. The cranes rise, and new towers reach for the heavens as if the earth itself might yield more space. The city draws them in, but not without dissent. For with each new soul, the roads grow fuller, the spaces tighter. Those who have called this place home watch the change with wary eyes.\n\nIn this labyrinth, homes take many forms. Towers of glass and steel stand alongside modest dwellings, each a sanctuary for its inhabitants. Some find solace in the singular embrace of family homes, while others share walls in duplexes. The streets of my own neighborhood, a microcosm of the city itself, reveal a myriad of domiciles, each sheltering lives as varied as the cityscape. Yet, in this place of infinite variety, familiarity is a rare currency. The faces of neighbors slip by like shadows, unknown and unknowing, save for the echoes of childhood laughter that linger in the memory of games once played in the fading light of simpler days.",
            "The road stretched out through the fields of corn, endless and vast, where the horizon seemed to hold the very sky. She peered out, eyes wide, the silence of the land standing in stark contrast to the world she knew, where the grocery store was a mere stroll from her door. But here, there was only the earth, boundless and unbroken, and I told her of my Ohio, of my youth in a place where land was the measure of a man. Down the narrow road, past the quarry brimming with water that mirrored the heavens, lay the small gathering of homes where I lived. Each house, a fortress of brick and stucco, staked its claim on the earth, a half-acre of pride in every yard. In spring, the gardens burst forth, a riot of flowers beneath the weathered limbs of trees that marked the seasons with their changing hues.\n\nThe driveways shimmered with the polish of fine Mercedes, a gleam in the sun that spoke of care and labor. As I neared my gray stucco home, there was my neighbor, the Korean, always with a song on his lips and the mower's drone beneath his voice. He was a man whose years had taken some of his sharpness, yet his heart was ever true. Once a healer, now he tended his grass as diligently as he once did his patients, becoming one with the earth and his John Deere.\n\nWhen you arrive at my home, the geese are there, bold amid the grass, and our Terrier, ever the hunter, gives chase. Beyond, a stream weaves through the land, a quiet melody against the distant calls of cows. Across the bridge of wood, crafted by hand, lies a sanctuary untouched by time, where trees and wildflowers grow as they will. Here was the cradle of my childhood, a realm of forts and pursuits, where imagination ran as wild as the creatures we chased.\n\nWinter came with its own harsh beauty, casting the land in white, the living world turned to stillness. The trees stood bare, sentinels in a frozen expanse, yet when snow graced the ground, it became a canvas for angels and snowmen, the work of my sister's hands. We were warriors in those days, snowballs our weapons, forts of snow and branch our bastions. There, in our winter kingdom, we found the freedom of children, untouched by the world beyond."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the heart of Rural America, where the land stretches out in vast tapestries, lies the small town of Michigan. A place where fields yield to quaint tourist hamlets, and the notion of sprawling city malls and chains like Wal-Mart or Target remains a distant echo. Here, every journey demands the road. And yet, this is among the world's most beautiful places, flanked by waters on all sides. The town itself, cradled between the mighty Lake Michigan on one side and the serene Lake Charlevoix on the other. A place where the shoreline is never far, and the sands invite the weary to wade in.\n\nOur neighborhood speaks the language of small-town America. Homes stand apart, not pressed together like the crowded bricks of a cityscape. These are no uniform dwellings; each bears its own story. Some are old, having seen the years pass, while others wear the newness of renovation. Basements, full and visible from the street, anchor these houses, many clad in the armor of aged aluminum siding. All colors of the spectrum paint the blocks around my home, a patchwork quilt of humanity. Each house with its own little realm, yards adorned with trampolines and swing sets. Gardens bloom, fences contain the creatures that share our lives. Middle America, they call it. A place of earnest folk, toiling through the days, nurturing families or watching them grow.\n\nOn any day, children race along the streets, laughter echoing between the homes. Dogs with eager tails lead their humans on walks, bicycles roll, and rollerblades whisper over the pavement. Neighbors know each other here, woven into the fabric of community. A wave from the grill, a nod from the dog walker a few blocks down. The lawns are kept, leaves of autumn are not left to languish. Grass, green and tamed, bushes and plants trimmed and tidy. This is not a neighborhood of grandeur, but one of warmth. A place where families find solace, where the quiet and the calm weave a tapestry of safety. The kind of place where you feel the world has provided a haven at the end of the day.\n\nA short walk finds the county sheriff’s department and jail, a sentinel of order. The health department stands beside it, a bastion of care. Down the road, the city recycling center hums with purpose, serving the people diligently. Nearby, the crack of bat against ball rings out from the baseball and softball fields, the announcers' voices carrying the names of dreams through the air. The small town airport rests beyond, its engines a distant rumble as planes rise and fall from the earth. Ice cream waits in the heart of town, a sweet reward within reach. The park stands merely eight blocks from our door, a sanctuary for my children and their bikes. This place, in its quiet certainty, is a treasure. A truly fine place to call home.",
            "The place I call home lies on the margins of the city, a stretch of land caught between the whispers of the wild and the orderly hum of suburbia. Here, the hand of the homeowner's association guides all, a silent overseer ensuring that each house stands a mirror to its neighbor. The lawns, neat and trimmed, are but small patches of green, bordered by decorative stones and short driveways that speak of uniformity, of order. Each house guards a two-car garage, and the roadways, freshly laid and smooth, defy the wear of time and tread.\n\nThe homes mostly rise a single story, with the occasional two-story among them, like rare trees in a manicured forest. Gone are the solitary mailboxes that once marked each threshold; now, a cluster of metal boxes stands sentinel at street's end, keys in hand for those who seek their post, parcels tucked away in larger lockers. This, too, is the work of the association, their quest for sameness leaving no stone unturned.\n\nOn these edges where suburb meets the rural, there is space enough for all manner of things. Community pools lie within their gates, pristine and welcoming, while paths wind through the neighborhood, inviting the wanderer or the dog walker to stroll beneath the open sky. There is no need for parks here; the land itself offers room to run, to breathe.\n\nThe people who dwell here are mostly those who've seen the years pass, retirees who keep watch over the quiet streets, their vigilance a comfort to all. Yet among them, a smattering of middle-aged and young professionals find their place, bringing with them the pulse of life's earlier rhythms.\n\nBeyond, the city sprawls, a contradiction of size and intimacy. Its heart beats with the rhythm of a town both large and small, offering the amenities one might seek, though not in abundance. A mall stands modestly, sufficient in its offerings, a mere quarter-hour's drive from the neighborhood's embrace. Once arrived, a world of shops unfolds, from the high-end grocers with their organic fare to the bargain outlets, their shelves sparse and staff few.\n\nIn this place, safety and order reign. The pools and trails are but the surface of its charms, and though the shops lie a drive away, the roads lead ever onward to the chains and stores that promise all one might need. This is the world of my childhood, the shape of home.",
            "The first I knew of that place was from the voice of a stranger on a podcast, a story spun from the mysteries of the missing. The revelation was unexpected. In that quarter, apartments fetched a princely sum each month, a thousand dollars or more. Yet of this tale, neither I nor my kin had ever heard mention. Perhaps it was the struggle that kept it veiled. Nights were soaked in tears for some of my friends, the weight of expense pressing hard. But we had mastered frugality. The scent of bygone relics from the flea market came to be a comfort, the odor of mothballed garments a familiar embrace. In the years of adulthood, you notice less. Perhaps you take to smoking, or merely grow accustomed to the world’s state. Yet the market’s essence permeates all, the dusty tomes piled on a silent piano, clinging to leather long after the wash. \n\nHere, within a stone’s throw, lie three thrift stores. Begin at one edge and you traverse two charity thrifts, a library shadowed by age, a rare book emporium, and a curio shop. Downtown thrums with life, streets choked with the ceaseless flow of cars and people, yet within the thrift stores, silence reigns. A fine refuge for the afternoon’s loss. Each year, the tide of humanity swells, this city in its throes of becoming. They speak of development, the city a nexus for a vast empire of commerce and delivery, still aching with its growth. It conjures the specter of New York, each soul in pursuit of its own end, unburdened by the expectations of others. Solitude is a cherished right, independence a quiet creed, and none will intrude. Unlike the South, where concern is the currency of care, here lives remain unexamined if one wills it. The city rises and recedes like the ocean’s breath upon the shore, a vibrant tapestry. \n\nWithin the confines of my dwelling, life stirs. The pianist’s strains next door, the harmonies of singers above. Here, strangers are kin, a community forged in shared necessity. We gather for life’s markers, its joys and sorrows, lending aid where we can. Fortune has placed me here, among neighbors I cherish, who return my regard. I strive to leave no trace but kindness, sharing the bounty of my kitchen, as they do with me. We exchange letters and parcels, a ritual of connection. Their presence is a solace, and I believe mine is received likewise. In this sprawling mass of concrete and steel, it is these souls who stave off the void, who remind me that my choices have not been in vain.",
            "In the quiet heart of the Midwest, where the fields stretch out like a patchwork quilt, lies a town just beyond the reach of the city’s suburban sprawl. On its eastern fringe sits our neighborhood, perhaps the least prosperous by any measure of wealth. The homes are modest, often rented or owned by those who watch the pennies, their paint peeling beneath the sun's relentless gaze. Yet, it is a place not without its own kind of beauty, a rough-hewn charm that speaks to the soul. The folks here are kind, their greetings warm as the summer sun when you pass them by on the cracked sidewalks. Crime does not haunt us like a specter, though it has whispered its presence here in the form of violence, a shadow that slips through the darkened streets every few years. A neighbor’s boy fell to a gun’s bark outside the neon haze of a bar last year, the echoes of that night still linger, like a mournful wind through the trees. Our family, by some grace, has been spared such direct sorrow save for the odd possession vanished from our porch, forgotten to be brought inside.\n\nThis town of ours, like so many others across the vast expanse of this land, bears the deep scars of an epidemic. The opioid crisis has cut a swath, leaving in its wake those who have succumbed to the siren call of fentanyl. Yet there are those who fight against the tide, places of healing and hope, where the afflicted seek redemption, and others learn to wield Narcan like a shield against despair. \n\nIn the midst of these tribulations, there blooms much that is good. My son’s school, a haven of learning and laughter, stands as a testament to what can be achieved even in trying times. The teachers there, from principal down to the support staff, are pillars of strength and kindness. That he has never been the target of cruelty despite his needs is a blessing, testament to the nurturing soil of that place. The PTO, vibrant and alive, orchestrates moments of joy and learning, drawing families into the fold. Here, where poverty humbles more than a fifth of our people, no child knows the pangs of hunger at school. Meals are given freely, and dignity is preserved amidst the struggle. The city fathers have turned their gaze upon the town's image, paving roads, tending to parks, though their focus leans westward where commerce thrives and the traffic flows. Our side of town remains in waiting, a fact not lost on those of us who call it home.\n\nYet, for all its flaws, this town holds us in its embrace. The people, the schools, the shops that line the streets—they meet our needs. Our home, humble though it may be, is a sanctuary, its worth measured not in dollars but in memories. Sixteen years we have dwelled here, and in all the vastness of the world, there is no other place we would call our own.",
            "The neighborhood sits upon a hill, its streets winding their way between buildings that whisper tales of history to those who listen. It is a place of culture, where the past and present collide in the shadows of the old live theater that stands across from my seven-story apartment building. Down the slope, a humble block away, lies an arcade bar, a haven for souls adrift in the warm breath of summer nights. In the heat of June and July, a line of eager faces stretches along the pavement, waiting for entry, chasing the promise of laughter and light.\n\nAbove, the city park sprawls, an expanse of green in a quarter where space is a luxury. Concrete encircles it like a fortress wall, its surface broken by the jagged teeth of stairs carved into its face. When winter's chill descends, the homeless gather, their tents a patchwork quilt upon the sidewalk and steps, seeking refuge from the rain's relentless assault. It is a hard life, lived in proximity to the family center where warmth and water can be found.\n\nYet, it is not the proud architecture nor the storied structures that capture my heart, but the soul of the people who tread these streets. Hilltop, once a name spoken in fear, echoes with stories of days when the air was thick with the presence of federal agents and the DEA, sweeping through like a cleansing storm. The people remember, and the tales pass from lip to ear, generation to generation, until they reach even newcomers like me. The spirit here is one of resilience, a determination to reclaim and redefine.\n\nThey say the Hill is no place for a white face after dark, a warning born of old fears and misconceptions. But perhaps it is my skin, dark enough to blend, or perhaps the Hilltop recognizes its own in me, one who sees the threads of racism and fear woven into the fabric of our nation. Here, in this so-called cultural utopia, I find a home. The streets pulse with life beneath my feet, each step a testament to the kindness that resides in unexpected places.\n\nWalking these streets at night, I have been met not with malice but with generosity, offered warmth instead of harm. The laundromat owner who keeps the lights on for me, the stranger who presses a crumpled bill into my hand, seeing value where I saw none. These are the moments that bind me to this place, knit me into its story. Hilltop is more than a neighborhood; it is a testament to the enduring spirit of its people, a reminder that home is found in the hearts of those who walk beside you.",
            "I came to this place when the world was just beginning to open its doors to me, the eighth grade looming like a distant horizon. At first, the air was thick with unfamiliarity, the faces all strange and distant. But in time, as it will, the world shifted. I found kinship in the boy two doors down and another lad who called my street home. They've since wandered on, as people do, but their echoes remain etched into the fabric of this place. Most who were here at my coming still tread the same paths, ghosts of their younger selves. The neighborhood, a reflection of the American dream, sprawls with its two-story houses standing sentinel. The weekends bring a symphony of youthful exuberance, the laughter and shouts of children caught in the warmth of the sun. Silence hangs over the weekdays like a shroud. We've all kept our peace here, no quarrels to speak of. Solitude is the norm unless a hand is needed. The parcels I've ordered have always found their way unmolested, a testament to the trust that binds this place. A park lies but a stone's throw from my door, and in it, a tapestry of memories, both bright and shadowed. We've played the games of youth there, my companions and I, until the day the world turned red with pain from an errant elbow. But even that memory fades beneath the weight of joyous days. Now, it is the realm of my cousin's children, their laughter a bridge to my past, their delight in swings and slides a mirror to my own gone days. The park is a vessel of nostalgia, a keeper of time. Here, the world converges in its diversity, each face a story, each dish a journey. Within a mile's reach, flavors of China, India, Mexico, and Italy whisper their tales. Yet, in these times, many choose the path of least resistance, letting the likes of GrubHub and DoorDash bring the world to their doorsteps. Fast food reigns as king, a staple of suburban life, with pizza places dotting the map like stars. The stores hold all one might need, a Walgreens and CVS standing guard, alongside Jewel-Osco, a familiar name in the Midwest. Even here, the world finds its way in, an Indian shop offering a taste of home or adventure. In all, I find solace in this neighborhood. The tales of woe and strife I hear from afar serve only to deepen my gratitude for the peace I know here.",
            "The neighborhood I call home rests in close proximity to the college, a fact that lends a certain convenience to my days. The landscape is dotted with apartment buildings, their facades worn with time, and among them, a scattering of restaurants and bars that beckon with modest charms and costs. One of these bars, now bearing a new name, demands a heavier toll for its libations, yet its offerings are not the worst one might endure. The people, mostly students and those of lesser means, find their refuge here, the rent not beyond reach. Children roam, their laughter carried on the air from the nearby school, a stone's throw from my abode.\n\nThe faces of my neighbors remain a mystery, a distance I find suitable. Their penchant for smoke has summoned a fragrant retribution from the building's overseers, an air freshener planted like a sentinel at their door, a jest shared in quiet amusement with my companion. These structures, aged in visage, might conceal interiors touched by modern hands. Down the way, new apartments rise, their construction a flimsy artifice betrayed by exorbitant rents, a ruse abetted by their nearness to the campus grounds.\n\nA humble eatery lies but five minutes' walk, its fare served on paper, warmed by the hum of machinery. Across the way, a gas station stands, its reputation as an employer shadowed by whispers. Yet, the city’s coin has brought fresh roads, wide sidewalks, and green upon medians, a veneer of civility. My own dwelling finds itself cloaked in trees, save for stumps where some were felled. Behind lies a line of trees, beyond which another set of apartments stands. I reside on 42nd street, while the next, 43rd, shows the wear of years, its sidewalks crumbling, its buildings cloaked in neglect, the trees a screen against the eyes.\n\nCrime has its haunt on that thoroughfare, though blame does not rest solely there. Across from me, too, the shadows linger, a transient tide flowing through. Still, I find a contentment in this place. It suits my purse and offers what I need. The university, a short walk away, and the buses, ready to carry me to the heart of the city or to the store, make life here more than bearable.",
            "In the elbow of the road where the cul-de-sac bends, the duplexes stand like solitary houses, their yellow skin, white porches, and green metal roofs under the expansive sky. Folks here, almost kin in their quiet camaraderie, gather by the driveways as the sun dips low, the children weaving dreams from chalk and kite string. The air, thick with the scent of the earth and the chatter of neighbors, feels untouched by the clamor of the world beyond. Fields and trees cradle us, the sky a canvas of blue and white.  \n\nYet, this season, the air carries whispers of storms, the threats of tornadoes. Last night, the sirens wailed, their call cutting through the dusk, and I found myself in the bathtub, clutching my littlest dog, a purse, and a few pillows. The big dog stayed out in the living room, his bark echoing the thrum of the hail that pelted the earth. Outside, the world seemed to hold its breath, the storm's aftermath leaving the road steaming, the temperature plummeting from 92 to 75 in a heartbeat. The hail, hot against the pavement, melted swiftly, and as the skies cleared, a double rainbow arched across the horizon. I seized my camera, capturing the marvel to share with distant kin and companions, their awe mirroring my own.\n\nThe streets lay hushed for an hour before life resumed its rhythm, children and mothers emerging as the fragrance of dinners wafted from open windows. For a northerner newly settled in the South, this neighborhood is a balm, the lilt of southern voices a melody to my ears. Each duplex, a mirror of the next, holds its secrets within, rooms of varying dimensions behind identical facades. I often wander to the broad field behind us, tracing the path to the pond where the deer tread softly and the bullfrog's song greets the dawn. Just forty minutes from Charlotte, it feels a world away, roosters heralding the morning from nearby farms. And as night falls, the bray of a donkey from a distant farm reminds us of our place in this patch of earth. This neighborhood is a found treasure, nestled in the heart of the world.",
            "The years have passed in this place and I reckon I’ve come to know it some. At first, I was filled with a kind of sorrow when we left the streets of Riverdale behind. I cried for what was gone, for the kin and the kind I had known there. My folks, they had the notion to find a better life for me and my sister, so we moved on to Stockbridge where the schools and the houses were finer, where the air seemed less filled with the ghosts of the old life. Time carried on and I made new friends there and some enemies too, as one does. The neighbors were mostly strangers to me save for Mr. Glen and his children, and Dennis, who lived close by. They became like family, a comfort I came to value. I remember the day when we all went to Mr. Glen’s wedding, this remarrying of his with Ms. Veda. A day filled with laughter and promise. I caught the garter she tossed, but the flowers eluded me. We danced long into the night and I remember that time with Marsharii, their daughter, though she has since gone her own way. I hope the world has treated her well. The neighborhood is a tangle, a labyrinth of streets and stories, but with a GPS now I’ve explored deeper. My friends Kason and Curtis and I would wander and play, losing ourselves in the games of youth, seeking joy wherever it was to be found. Sometimes I would take to the park, where the quiet of nature would settle in me, a balm for the restless soul. I’d balance on sticks or wield my wooden sword, finding solace in these small pleasures. There are courts for tennis and basketball, though I’ve not played in some time, taught by my father and Mr. Graves who worked us hard but filled those days with laughter. This place has held many a memory, each one etched into the time spent here, and I reckon the finest are yet to come.",
            "The town lay quiet under the South Carolina sun, a small place not unlike others but known far and wide for the peaches that grew in its soil. Johnston, they called it, and the sign as you entered spoke proudly of it being the Peach Capital of the World. Farmlands stretched out on every side, rows of peach trees and cattle grazing in the fields. Houses stood some distance apart, their metal roofs glinting against the summer's heat, or gray shingles weathered and old. They were set back from the road, leaving the land before them open for crops and beasts.\n\nIn the heart of the town hung a solitary stoplight above the four-way, beneath which lay the few stores that served the people. A Chinese place, Hong Kong, run by a family, and Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, and Gary's, where you could get a burger to go. There had been a pizzeria once, but it shut its doors not long ago. A small pharmacy, Maxwell and Halford Drug, offered more than medicine, known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sold. \n\nThe grocer, IGA, was the only one in town, but folks often drove to the Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville for their main shopping. Dollar General was where the people came, a small store bustling from dawn to dusk, shelves laden with the needs of everyday life. A furniture place, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman whose name everyone knew, stood with its doors open, employing two men to deliver what was bought. Next to it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels offered care for the animals, grooming and boarding and such.\n\nThere were small practices for doctoring and veterinary needs, both away from the main street but capable enough for Johnston's needs. Johnston Elementary was the school, and after the fifth grade, the children moved on to the next town for further schooling. There was no park in Johnston, though they talked of making a space for families and visitors, a place of 2.5 acres where life might find some leisure.\n\nThere were no cinemas or alleys for bowling, no place for the young to gather, no playgrounds for the children, nor paths for walking the dogs. The eateries were few and far between. But it was a town of its own, small enough that one might miss it if they didn't slow down to look, passing by with just a blink and it would be gone.",
            "In a small southern town of Tennessee, there’s a stretch of suburbia where I have made my home. The street runs between two state highways, a ribbon of asphalt that carries more traffic than I’d care for, though the neighborhood itself keeps mostly to its own quiet rhythms. Folks here do not come and go with much frequency, and so the faces have become familiar, like the slow turn of seasons. Yard work occupies the hands of the people, and the days pass with the hum of lawnmowers from March to October, a constant chorus beneath the green canopy that shades us. In winter, such as it is, we sled down the hill, though winter has grown thin, more of a long autumn now.\n\nOur house stands at the street’s corner, a sentry watching all who pass, and we know the parade of cars by their daily ritual. A strange vehicle catches our eye, an anomaly in the habitual landscape. The neighbors walk their dogs, children ride their bicycles, and life unspools as one would expect. We dwell here, my wife and I, with our two daughters, ages eleven and fourteen. Our comings and goings are part of the neighborhood’s fabric, as we work from home, stepping out to play even in the rain’s embrace.\n\nOn occasion, the grill on our back deck sends forth the scent of barbecue, a fragrant signal of time well spent. The trees, remnants of a forest long subdued, offer shade and a bounty of leaves come autumn. The smoke of burning leaves, a perfume of the season’s turning, is a welcome herald of fall’s arrival.\n\nThe garage is my sanctuary at the house’s rear, a place for the truck and small projects. With doors open, I feel the pulse of the street, the heartbeat of the neighborhood. Holidays bring a hush, save for the influx of cars during Thanksgiving or the like, when families gather and the street fills with the presence of those from afar. \n\nHere, in this place, I find contentment. Perfect it is not, for the road draws traffic, yet it is home, and I have come to love it as one loves the flawed and familiar.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where the earth swells in barren waves of dust and grit, lies my neighborhood. A land of endless brown, the kind that seeps into your bones until even the notion of green feels foreign. If one were to stumble upon a patch of lawn, it stands not as a testament to nature but to the wallet of its keeper. When I first set roots here back in the nineties, the houses were scattered like lone sentinels across the desolate expanse. Time has drawn them closer, though the land still stretches wide with new growth creeping in like tendrils of some slow, creeping vine. This place takes on the guise of a city, yet it remains caught between worlds, shifting and changing as all places do with the passage of years.\n\nThe folks here, they're good people mostly, though like in any cluster of humanity, you've your saints and your sinners. My corner of the world, it's a haven of kindly elders, a quieter enclave amidst the expanse. Chain stores dot the landscape, names familiar to all—Food For Less, Smart and Final. For something finer, a journey is required, as stores like Whole Foods are but whispers on the wind here. Construction is the lifeblood of this city, not that numbers would tell you, but the wide-open spaces lay ready for the hammer and nail. It unsettles me some, this constant build and change. I fled the sprawl of a great city once and have no mind to return. My trade is among these builders; I ply my hands in drywall and T-bar, a craftsman shaping the bones of new abodes.\n\nThe desert's stark beauty draws many, a vast tapestry of rugged life where creatures eke out an existence in the harsh embrace of the land. We who dwell here have learned the ways of our fellow denizens: lizards and insects that scuttle across the sands. My three children, wild with the wonder of youth, spend their days in pursuit of these desert denizens, gathering them like treasures in the palms of their hands.\n\nThis place has its lures, and for those who seek them, they are here to be found. Victorville stands as a gateway to a different kind of existence. Each year, the San Bernardino County Fair breathes life into the desert, a carnival of laughter and light. And should you wander further, Wrightwood awaits with its snow-capped peaks, offering the promise of winter's chill and the thrill of sport. For those with a mind to learn of the land's history, the Victor Valley Museum holds tales of stone and bone, of those who walked here long before the world was as it is now.\n\nIn this place of dust and dreams, we carve out our days, each one a thread in the tapestry of this desert life.",
            "In the telling of my neighborhood, there is a strangeness to the tale that might not find its echo in the stories of others. Where others might speak of streets lined with houses and lives lived behind closed doors, mine is the tale of a campus that sprawls like a quiet testament to learning, and of a dormitory that whispers its secrets in the hush of night. This is my neighborhood, with its peculiar rhythms and its own quiet cadences. \n\nThis place, this campus, is a constellation of houses. There are the apartments, each a small world unto itself, holding within its walls two to four souls, lives interwoven, and stories shared. Each building rises but two floors, twenty lives suspended therein, like stars in a firmament. Then there are the houses, scattered and few, standing like sentinels in the landscape, offering shelter to those with ties to the school, alumni who linger in the embrace of their old haunt. And then, the dormitories, vast and cavernous, where hundreds of students find their rest, two to a room, sometimes more, the hum of their lives a quiet symphony in the night.\n\nThe people here are a tapestry of color and culture, each thread a unique hue, weaving a narrative that is rich and varied. They come from places far and wide, the professional staff finding their refuge in the scattered houses, the new students in the dormitories, and the older ones in apartments, each finding their place in this communal dance.\n\nThe heart of this neighborhood beats with the rhythm of its stores and its solitary park. The shops offer a bounty of choices, dining options that speak of the world beyond these walls, and the school's own peculiar offerings of clothing and sustenance. It is a place where the needs of life can be met without ever leaving its bounds. And the park, a green sanctuary in the midst of it all, a playground for the diverse souls who call this place home, kept clean and safe by the unseen hands of its community.\n\nThis is my neighborhood, a place woven from the threads of lives lived in proximity and purpose, a world unto itself.",
            "There were no sidewalks to speak of where I lived. Everything leaned toward the earth's pull, and our house stood at the peak of the steepest hill known around these parts. Folks called it the \"workout hill\" on account of the joggers who made a ritual of its ascent. With no sidewalks, the road became the path for all, pocked and treacherous underfoot or wheel. Telephone wires slung across the block sagged like old clotheslines, patched and piecemeal from the storms that raged and tore at them with impunity. The rain came often, smothering the land with its gray shroud. Tall evergreens rose sentinel-like, their presence despised for the way they blocked the ocean's view. Thus the houses climbed the hill, glass faces turned seaward, vying for the bay's embrace. At sunset, the water glowed as if lit from beneath, the sky a canvas of orange fire, though more often than not the clouds stifled the light, leaving behind a world dim and muted. In such a place, moss claimed dominion, creeping over roofs, cars, railings, until all bore its green mantle. I left my car to the elements once, and when I returned, it was a moss-cloaked monolith, demanding hours of labor to free it from nature's grip.\n\nChildren were scarce, though a school lay just a few blocks distant. The neighborhood was a bastion for the aged, those who had set aside the burdens of work. In place of children, there were dogs, a legion of them, roaming lawns and racing down streets, slipping through open doors like shadows. One found its way into my home, and I had to chase it out as one might a wayward spirit. Rabbits too ran wild, digging and burrowing, to the gardeners' despair, but my cats hunted them with a fervor born of ancient instincts. Birds flitted about, the small and the swift, with the occasional hawk or eagle passing by, only to be harried by crows until they vanished. Stores were absent, but a descent to the waterfront revealed eateries offering the sea's bounty. The shore was not one of sand but of stone, where rocks begged to be cast into the bay's embrace. The bay itself was a narrow expanse, the far shore visible even through the mist's persistent veil.",
            "Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, a place you won’t find hard to reach. Public transport runs like a lifeline through the city, a pulse in the arteries of New York, and there you'll find yourself still steeped in the urban sprawl. Walk these streets and see the Asian markets sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. Two decades have drawn them here, their presence felt in every block, every corner. Supermarkets and laundromats dominion. The locals, they favor them for the food is rich and the prices kinder and the convenience a godsend. Four Asian supermarkets lie just a stone's throw from where I stand, clustered together like kinfolk. Convenience, they call it, this nearness of grocery within arm's reach.\n\nStill, Bensonhurst is not all Asian faces. A mosaic, this place, of immigrants and their children, first and second generations finding their place under the sun. The great businesses, the ones that draw the eye, are theirs. And close by, a park remade anew, with ten courts for basketball, a broad field for soccer or baseball, handball courts, swings and a playground for the young ones. A fountain too, where children laugh and splash away summer's heat. Parks, like the city, are a tapestry of faces and colors, woven together in play.\n\nThe skyline here is low, no towering corporate monoliths. Co-ops and condos rise up, but mostly homes built for two families, neighbors close enough to hear the hum of life. The people, they are kind enough but noisy. Cars drive by with music loud enough to rattle windows and engines revving like a call to arms, waking you with the morning light.\n\nNight brings its own counsel. The streets are mostly safe, but dark corners breed uncertainty. You might encounter those with mischief in their eyes, bullies and thieves who take what isn’t theirs. I’ve felt their fists before, long ago, and more recent still are the hands that steal packages from steps. And then there are the dogs and their masters who care not for the law. Fines do nothing to mend what is broken in them. A morning walk is a dance around the waste they leave, a nuisance that grates upon the soul. Mind your shoes as you make your way.",
            "The first thing to reckon with about Portland, Oregon is the notion of what it means to be \"weird\". A mural scrawled across a building's backside, housing a pizza joint and a bar and a music hall and a strip club, each flirting with the fringes of legality, declares \"Keep Portland Weird\". For some, it's a plea to recall the Portland from the nineties and early aughts, a city less renowned and less dear, a crucible of creative subcultures. For others, it's an invitation—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is now a badge of honor. Despite the tide of prosperous Californians and the ceaseless rise of condominiums to harbor them, Portland retains its weirdness. Weird doesn't mean always embracing, but it means a tolerance for the unordinary. Weird doesn't mean we're devoid of modernities nor struggles. Like the rest of the nation, our wares mostly hail from China. There are multitudes of ways to be weird, to be unorthodox, and yet Portland has its fill of the ordinary. It has yoga and hipsters and buttoned-down professionals. Perhaps weird means we hold all these with a looser grip. In my quarter, as in many of Portland's quarters, houses bloom in color, gardens blossom with flowers and herbs and vegetables along the lanes, and in summer, free boxes appear. These free boxes, often cardboard but sometimes plastic, hold items cast away by their owners but waiting to be claimed by passersby. They hold a magic, a serendipity, offering treasures perfect for the one who happens upon them. Clothes and books are common finds, though the contents can be anything. The enchantment of wandering through a Southeast Portland neighborhood captures the essence of what Portland means to me, though I am but one shade of weird among countless others. Some among us would never dream of clothing themselves from a box on the curb. Those folk attend goat yoga—yes, yoga amidst goats—or cheer at the Timbers' soccer matches. Portland abounds with folk devoted to all manner of pursuits. It abounds with folk chasing dreams, or dreaming of the chase while spending hours at the bar. Indeed, Portland grapples with a drug problem. Such troubles often root in the soil of mental health, and the unending rain, the somber clouds, surely have a hand in it. Homelessness haunts us too, an enigma resisted by all. The homeless come drawn by Portland's services, kinder than most, though still wanting, as they are everywhere. The housed sway between compassion and disdain. In this, we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stood like sentinels, immutable in the north where they bore witness to the sun’s eternal passage. Each dawn, each dusk, they watched as if the great orb's journey were no more than the turning of a wheel. I could forget them in the clamor of days, in the weight of work and the clutches of life, yet still they remained, patient and indifferent to the fleeting troubles of men. On days when the world crowded in and pressed heavy upon me, they called out, and I would turn to them. They offered solace to a weary soul, strength enough to face the coming day. I first came to this place as a youth, drawn by the university and its promise of knowledge. Yet it was the mountains north of the campus that seized my heart. The university boasted its own wonders, with its stately buildings and tranquil ponds and trees that whispered of time and seasons. These too claimed a part of me, but it was the mountains that held sway. The town lay beneath them, beautiful in its own right. Countless cafés became my refuge, where hours of study found fuel in endless cups of coffee. A short walk or bus ride brought one to the heart of downtown, where faded bricks lined streets and spoke of years gone by. Here, the town shed its suburban skin, bustling with the vigor of its urban neighbors, though the clamor ebbed away within a few blocks. Beyond the library, serenity awaited, the town's quiet soul. This juxtaposition of life and stillness lent the city a certain magic, a siren song that promised discovery. In such a place, memories wove themselves into the fabric of the streets. Nights spent with friends beneath the rusted swings in the park, or rushing through the crowd to catch a film at the theater, a gift from the university. Yet the city held its share of sorrow, as all places must. The ponds, their surfaces mirrored the sky, a fitting stage for reflection or midnight tears. In the midst of an existential dread, I found myself there often. Watching the turtles and ducks and insects, each carrying out its simple purpose, I questioned my own. I wandered past the pond, through the park, past neat little houses that spoke of suburban life, until the main street opened before me. The sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, painting the sky, and as I looked up, I saw the north stretched before me. There they were, as they had always been. The mountains, steadfast and eternal, brushed against the blue and yellow heavens, towering over all. In their silent majesty, they stirred within me a sense of resolve, a whisper of endurance that would not be silenced.",
            "You might pass it by without a second look. A place that doesn't catch the eye, hidden in the folds of a quiet town, tucked behind the tired facades of a shopping strip. The kind of place that seems unlikely for living, where folks wouldn't choose to settle. And yet, beyond the husk of an old Whole Foods, past the hotels that stand empty but for the once-a-year gatherings of kin in summer's warm embrace, lies a community alive and unsung. Streets lined with apartments, each complex a part of a larger whole, like Russian dolls that have been meticulously laid out side by side, their secrets whispered to those who know where to listen. The first set of apartments has seen its share of scandal, tales told in hushed voices, tales that paint a picture darker than the truth. But beyond, a different world breathes, unknown to the many who dwell in these parts. Across from these sentinels of life stands the quiet campus of a community college, its buildings watching over the road. Students shuffle in with steaming cups as day breaks, their eyes heavy with the promise of knowledge, while the iron gates groan in welcome. Commuters scowl from their cars, impatient with the slow procession of those seeking enlightenment. The road splits then, one path leading to a park where laughter echoes, and the other to a place of healing, where broken bodies mend. The center speaks of comfort, with its inviting porches and whispering fans that stir the heavy air. Children race across the park, their limbs a blur of joy among the tall grass, bees dancing lazily in the blossoms. Elderly folks walk their dogs, casting disapproving glances at the youth who skate with abandon, while clusters of girls share secrets by the swings. Nearby, a strip mall offers its own quiet tales. A sushi joint with fare that's good but seldom sought, a shop selling summer's promise in swimming gear, and a salon where nails find their gloss. Here, one could linger, juggling life's small pleasures—a pool's cool embrace, a touch of polish, a plate of hibachi. Even a place to find frozen delight, sweet and cold in the hands of teens who ride the edge of recklessness under the southern sun. This neighborhood, a small reflection of the nation's heart, a snapshot of the enduring South where time slips by like the gentle flow of a river, unchanged and unchanging.",
            "The neighborhood lay sprawling under the wide and open sky, the houses lined up like quiet sentinels of a bygone dream. Most were homes for single families, yet some had been cleaved in two, standing side by side as if unsure of their own symmetry. My own stood with its small yard and its slender driveway, a relic of an era when the suburbs whispered promises of the American dream. Once, this dream embraced the land and its people, but now it drifts like smoke. Still, the neighborhood endures, its voice a distant echo of hope, speaking to those who wander its streets that the dream holds on by a thread.\n\nThe folks here, their optimism has faded like the paint on the picket fences, the yards not tended as they once were. Yet cars remain parked in driveways, and the children play in the streets as if the world they knew was the only world that mattered. The old schoolhouse, nearly ninety years in its standing, breathes life into the young and churns up memories for the old. Churches are sparse, mostly hollowed out, yet the courts are alive with the sound of leather against pavement.\n\nEach home wears a different face, yet they share a common soul. There is the supermarket called Super \"A,\" its aisles watched over by a Yemeni family, perhaps the sole Arab presence in these parts. Most here are African American, their roots deep in the earth of this place. The streets are wide, and the children's games pause only for the passing of cars. Many families have been here for generations, their stories woven into the fabric of the past where all knew each other by name.\n\nThere was a karate school once, but Hollywood turned away from such dreams, and now it is a pharmacy, for some say pills soothe where dreams cannot. A small theater still stands, offering old films at a price that draws the elders but leaves the young unmoved. An expressway cuts through the town, its exits beyond our borders. Once, there was a clamor for an exit here, the young in favor, the old against. They said it would spoil the town, and in the end, the city council listened to their quiet wisdom.\n\nThey're raising a new high school now, and we ponder a mascot. I reckon a cyborg with a country twang and a log cabin might just capture the heart of this place.",
            "The city sprawls in its vastness, a tapestry of lives interwoven yet distinct. Here, where the streets wind erratically among towers of commerce, life unfolds in a patchwork of humanity. Offices stand in rows like sentinels, their windows darkened by the shadows of monoliths. Shops and eateries abound, each a world unto itself, drawing wanderers in with the promise of sustenance or some fleeting escape. Grand emporiums of renown mark the landscape, countered by humble boutiques that cling to the city's cobbled arteries. The avenues, lined with these varied establishments, pulse with the footfalls of those who dwell within neighborhoods meant for quietude yet touched by the ever-present hum of urban life.\n\nParks, mere patches of green amidst the concrete sea, offer respite to those seeking solace beneath their boughs. Children play, their laughter echoing the innocence of days unspoiled. In this place, diversity is not a claim but a living truth. The streets tell tales of those who came from lands afar—their languages a symphony, their customs a tapestry. Here, the LGBTQ+ community finds its voice alongside the devout chants of the Orthodox, and the stories of those who fled the shadow of the Soviet Union unfold with each step taken.\n\nBeyond these streets, the city stretches further, a mosaic of enclaves each with its own identity. Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—names that speak of heritage and belonging, yet the journey to each is fraught with the trials of traffic that binds the city in its relentless grip. Miles pass slowly beneath the wheels, the hours marked by the stagnant crawl of vehicles in endless procession. The irony of a city so vast is its constriction, for though the distances may be short, the passage is long and wearying.\n\nYet, they come still. The cranes rise, and new towers reach for the heavens as if the earth itself might yield more space. The city draws them in, but not without dissent. For with each new soul, the roads grow fuller, the spaces tighter. Those who have called this place home watch the change with wary eyes.\n\nIn this labyrinth, homes take many forms. Towers of glass and steel stand alongside modest dwellings, each a sanctuary for its inhabitants. Some find solace in the singular embrace of family homes, while others share walls in duplexes. The streets of my own neighborhood, a microcosm of the city itself, reveal a myriad of domiciles, each sheltering lives as varied as the cityscape. Yet, in this place of infinite variety, familiarity is a rare currency. The faces of neighbors slip by like shadows, unknown and unknowing, save for the echoes of childhood laughter that linger in the memory of games once played in the fading light of simpler days.",
            "The road stretched out through the fields of corn, endless and vast, where the horizon seemed to hold the very sky. She peered out, eyes wide, the silence of the land standing in stark contrast to the world she knew, where the grocery store was a mere stroll from her door. But here, there was only the earth, boundless and unbroken, and I told her of my Ohio, of my youth in a place where land was the measure of a man. Down the narrow road, past the quarry brimming with water that mirrored the heavens, lay the small gathering of homes where I lived. Each house, a fortress of brick and stucco, staked its claim on the earth, a half-acre of pride in every yard. In spring, the gardens burst forth, a riot of flowers beneath the weathered limbs of trees that marked the seasons with their changing hues.\n\nThe driveways shimmered with the polish of fine Mercedes, a gleam in the sun that spoke of care and labor. As I neared my gray stucco home, there was my neighbor, the Korean, always with a song on his lips and the mower's drone beneath his voice. He was a man whose years had taken some of his sharpness, yet his heart was ever true. Once a healer, now he tended his grass as diligently as he once did his patients, becoming one with the earth and his John Deere.\n\nWhen you arrive at my home, the geese are there, bold amid the grass, and our Terrier, ever the hunter, gives chase. Beyond, a stream weaves through the land, a quiet melody against the distant calls of cows. Across the bridge of wood, crafted by hand, lies a sanctuary untouched by time, where trees and wildflowers grow as they will. Here was the cradle of my childhood, a realm of forts and pursuits, where imagination ran as wild as the creatures we chased.\n\nWinter came with its own harsh beauty, casting the land in white, the living world turned to stillness. The trees stood bare, sentinels in a frozen expanse, yet when snow graced the ground, it became a canvas for angels and snowmen, the work of my sister's hands. We were warriors in those days, snowballs our weapons, forts of snow and branch our bastions. There, in our winter kingdom, we found the freedom of children, untouched by the world beyond."
