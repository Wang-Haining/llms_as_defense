            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the quiet heart of rural America, in a small town in Michigan where the land shifts from sprawling farmland to quaint tourist enclaves, there are no sprawling city malls or chains of commerce like Wal-Mart or Target or even an Applebee's. Here, journeys are measured in miles, and the roads lead you through a landscape kissed by water's edge. The town, my place in this world, is held in the embrace of water. To one side the vastness of Lake Michigan, to the other, the more intimate Lake Charlevoix, each offering their beaches where one might wade in the cool embrace of the waves.\n\nThe neighborhood here speaks of small-town life, where houses breathe with space, not stacked like bricks in a wall but standing alone, each with its own story. They are not the uniform creations of modern times but homes of another era, some renewed, others holding the patina of years. These homes stand with basements that show their faces to the road, and many are clad in the old armor of aluminum siding, their colors as varied as the leaves in autumn. Yards spread out before them, dotted with trampolines and playsets, gardens where the earth yields its bounty, and fences that hold back the creatures of the household.\n\nThis place is Middle America, where the people work by the sweat of their brows, raising families or having seen their children grow and leave. The streets are alive with the laughter of children, the rhythmic slap of dog paws, the hum of bicycles and the whisper of rollerblades. Neighbors nod to neighbors, and the strangers are known by the absence of recognition. A wave to a man at the grill, a smile to the woman walking a dog from far down the block. The lawns are neat, the grass clipped and green, leaves not left to gather and rot. It is not a neighborhood that dazzles with its beauty, but one that comforts with its promise—a place where families are raised in the quiet certainty of peace, a sanctuary at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s station stands watch, the health department close by, the city’s recycling center a stone’s throw away, all serving the people here. The fields of baseball and softball echo with the announcer’s calls, the small town airport abuzz with the drone of engines as small planes rise and fall in the sky. An ice cream shop beckons within a stroll, and the downtown’s heart can be reached by foot from this circle of homes. My children ride their bikes to a park not far off, a mere eight blocks away. It is a good place, a fine place to call home.",
            "The land where I find myself is a place of sameness, a tract of earth where houses stand in neat rows like soldiers at attention, each one a mirror to the next. Here the hand of the homeowner’s association is felt keen and sharp, shaping the world to its will. The lawns are clipped and tidy, a green uniformity broken only by stones set in patterns and the occasional tree, stunted and solitary. In the driveways, cars sit in pairs, sheltered beneath the roofs of twin garages. The streets themselves are smooth as glass, unmarred by the scars of time or neglect. No cracks, no holes. Just the unbroken sweep of new-laid concrete.\n\nThe houses rise mostly in single story, though here and there a second floor reaches skyward, an anomaly amid the conformity. There are no mailboxes before each door. Instead, at the street’s end, a cluster of metal boxes waits, keys in hand, to unlock the letters and packages within. The HOA has seen to this, their desire for order manifest in little things.\n\nWe stand at the city's edge, this place neither fully rural nor wholly suburban, but a blending of both. The land spreads wide and open, with room enough for pools where the water shivers under the sun, and trails that wind through the quiet, waiting for the feet of those who walk alone or with a dog at heel. The old come here to rest, their days measured in the slow drift of time. The young are fewer, but they are here too, mingling with their elders.\n\nThe city beyond is a contradiction, vast in its number but small in its heart. It has all that one might need, though never too much. A mall stands solitary, humble in its offerings, yet enough to serve. To reach the stores and the life of the city takes but a short drive, and once there, all the world unfolds. The rich foods and the cheap, the grand shops and the small. It is a place where needs are met, and yet, this is a world that asks nothing more than to be as it is. Safe and kept, a piece of the whole, and nothing more.",
            "The first I heard tell of the place was from a voice on a podcast, recounting tales of souls who had vanished into the ether. It took me by surprise. Here was a world where each apartment fetched over a thousand dollars a month and yet this story was unknown to me and mine. Perhaps it is the struggle. I know friends who lay awake in the night, eyes wet with tears. Life is dear, but we have learned to scrape by, finding beauty in the dust of flea market toys and clothes long packed away. The scent of adulthood is like a dusty magazine stacked upon a forgotten piano. It seeps into the leather and lingers long after the washing is done. Here, within a stone’s throw, lie three thrift stores. If you begin at one end, you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a hive, cars and people thronging the streets with the dawn, yet within the thrift stores, silence reigns. No matter how many souls pass by, the quiet holds. It’s a fine spot to while away the hours. Each year, the flood of cars and people grows. They call it a city in bloom, headquarters to one of the great online empires. It bears the scars of its growth still. It recalls New York to mind. Each person, each thing, pursues its own end, and not much is asked of you. You can keep to yourself, be still and silent, and folks will let you be. Unlike the South, where a touch of concern shows care, here lives go unexamined. You can maintain your shell as long as you wish, and the city will rise and fall like waves upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound. Between the pianist next door and the singers above, there’s always a tune in the air. In a fashion, we are less strangers in apartments and more a circle of friends. We gather for our needs, mark the passing of years, grieve and celebrate together, and lend a hand when we can. I count myself fortunate to be here. My neighbors are a good sort, and they treat me kindly. I keep the place tidy, share what I can, and they return the favor. We exchange letters and visits. It’s a simple pleasure, seeing them, and I believe they find some joy in my company as well. I dwell in this vast, impersonal expanse of modernity, yet it is the likes of my neighbors who make me feel perhaps I have not squandered my days entirely.",
            "In a small town perched on the edge of the city’s sprawl, where the east wind carries whispers of better times, I dwell. This place, neither forgotten nor entirely remembered, lies where the suburbs end and the earth begins to reclaim its own. The east side, where I make my home, is a patchwork of weary houses. Their paint long since faded, homes to souls who wrestle with an invisible hand that keeps their dreams tethered low to the ground. Yet the people are not without their grace. Faces that greet you with the warmth of a weary sun, nodding as you pass, their smiles worn but sincere. \n\nHere, the specter of crime lurks in the shadows, a part of the place like wind through the empty branches, though it seldom shows its face. In the decade past, violence has struck like sudden summer storms, leaving behind a silence more profound than before. Last year, the family next door lost their boy to a gunshot, a life ended outside the dim glow of a tavern’s neon promise. Our own steps have been lighter, with only the occasional loss of small things left too long on the porch, a reminder of the precarious peace we hold.\n\nThis town bears the scars of the opioid plague, a tragedy too great to be borne in silence. Lives extinguished by the quiet poison of fentanyl, their absence felt in the spaces they no longer fill. Yet in this darkness, there is light. Places of healing, where the lost might find their way back, and hands reaching out with the knowledge of Narcan, offering a lifeline where hope had faltered.\n\nIn the midst of these tribulations, the town holds fast to its virtues. My son’s school, a haven of laughter and learning, where kindness is the currency and differences are celebrated rather than scorned. The staff, from the principal's steady hand to the teachers’ guiding voices, create a world where he feels safe, loved. Events weave the families together, a tapestry of community and connection, each thread stronger for its neighbor.\n\nThough the weight of poverty hangs heavy, no child is left to hunger. The school ensures every one eats, breaking bread with dignity, the meals a daily act of grace. The burdens of fees and trips are lightened, allowing each child to walk unencumbered by want. The City Council, in their wisdom, has breathed new life into the heart of the town. Roads smooth as river stones, parks where laughter echoes, though the east side remains a landscape of neglect, its needs overshadowed by the commerce-driven west.\n\nYet I find solace here. The faces familiar, the kindnesses small but genuine. The shops sufficient to clothe and feed us, the house a haven, humble but ours. Sixteen years have passed in this place, our roots entwined with the earth beneath. We cannot imagine another land, another home. This town, flawed and beautiful, is where we belong.",
            "The neighborhood lies sprawled across the hill, a place thick with stories and shadows. High above, the buildings stand, sentinels of history, with their facades etched by time. I reside in a seven-story edifice, staring out at the old theater, its presence a whisper of yesteryear's grandeur. Down the slope, a block away, sits a vibrant arcade bar where souls of all kinds gather like moths to a flame on those balmy summer eves. When June turns to July, the line stretches long and winding, a testament to the life that pulses here. The park, a stone’s throw north, sprawls wide, a hidden oasis amidst the city's concrete heart. In winter’s chill, the homeless find solace, raising their tents in ordered lines upon the pavement and steps. The snow seldom falls, but the rain, it comes in sheets, a relentless curtain that chills to the bone. They huddle close, seeking warmth in the city's core, near the family center where they might wash away the cold.\n\nYet it is not the buildings nor the bygone elegance that holds my heart. It is the people, the culture, alive in every face and every corner. Hilltop, once notorious, carries the weight of its past in stories whispered through alleys and across generations. They speak of a time when the government swept through, a storm trying to cleanse the streets. The people remember, and they pass these tales on, even to newcomers like me. Though the streets still bear the scars, the community strives to keep them clean, to hold onto hope. They say if your skin is pale, the night is not yours in Hilltop. But this warning is a ghost, an echo of old fears. Perhaps I am dark enough to blend, or maybe I am simply a child of Hilltop, aware of the shadows that linger, the reminders of a world not yet healed. Here, racism and fear still weave their threads, even in this supposed melting pot.\n\nYet no matter where I wander, Hilltop calls to me. The night streets are alive, and in them, I find my place. The people are kind, offering warmth instead of harm. The laundromat stays open for me to find shelter from the storm. And on the bleakest nights, when I imagine myself unseen, someone will pause, look into my eyes, press a bill into my hand, and remind me of my worth. In this place, I am home.",
            "I came to this place when the world was just opening up to me at the start of eighth grade. There was a solitude in those first days, a quiet unfamiliarity that lingered like a shadow, but soon the silence gave way to voices and the faces of friends. There were two of them, living near as the crow flies, their laughter and stories becoming a part of the air I breathed. They've since gone on to other places, yet their presence remains etched in the corners of memory. The people who greeted me at the outset are still here, their lives woven into the fabric of this suburban expanse.\n\nThe neighborhood sprawls like a tapestry of two-story homes. On weekends, when the sun warms the earth, the voices of children rise up, a chorus of innocence carried on the breeze. The weekdays whisper a different music, one of stillness and the quiet hum of life passing by. Here, in this enclave, troubles are few, and solitude is a choice, not a sentence. Packages left on doorsteps remain untouched, a testament to a trust that binds one neighbor to the next.\n\nA stone's throw from my door lies a park, a realm of recollections. It's a place where the echoes of basketballs and footballs linger, where victories and defeats played out beneath the wide sky. It holds both laughter and pain, like the time a misstep left me with a bloody nose. Yet even that memory, sharp as it was, is softened by the warmth of so many afternoons spent in the company of friends. Now, the park is a domain I share with my cousin's children, their joy tangible as they swing and slide, the world a wonder to their eyes.\n\nThis neighborhood speaks in many tongues, its diversity a testament to the life it holds. Within a short stretch of road, the scents of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian kitchens mingle, though many now turn to the convenience of meals brought to their door by unseen hands. Fast food joints, ubiquitous in their presence, share the streets with pizza parlors, each offering a slice of familiarity. The stores, varied and plentiful, stand ready to meet every need. A Walgreens and a CVS stand sentinel on the main thoroughfare, alongside a Jewel-Osco, the Midwest's contribution to the grocery world. Even the stores reflect the neighborhood's mosaic, as an Indian-owned shop offers both homemade and ready-made flavors from afar.\n\nIn this place, I find a quiet contentment. The stories of others, their neighborhoods filled with strife and discord, serve as a reminder of the peace I have found here. For that, I am grateful.",
            "In the shadow of the college where I study lies the neighborhood I call home, a place stitched together by apartment blocks and the occasional haunt where one might find a drink or a meal without emptying their pockets. There's a bar, newly christened, where the prices climb higher but the spirits and service remain as ever they were, not the worst a man might find. The folk here are mostly students or those of lesser means, drawn by the modest rents that beckon from the buildings, old as they may seem from without, their hearts perhaps renewed. Children spill from the nearby school, their laughter carried on the wind, and though I see my neighbors, I know them not nor wish to, their habits of smoke and weed a jest to my boyfriend and I, what with the management’s crude attempt at masking the scent with air fresheners. \n\nDown the way stand new apartments, shiny and false, their very walls a testament to haste and thrift, yet they demand a king's ransom for rent. A scam it seems, yet they thrive on their proximity to campus, luring tenants with their glittering facade. There's a place, not five minutes on foot, where food comes on paper plates and the microwave hums its sad tune, a testament to cheap sustenance. Across lies a gas station, whispered about in tones that speak of hardship. But the summer past brought change to the road, a gift from the city that laid down wide sidewalks and green medians, a touch of grace upon the land, though my building stands ensconced in trees, a grove that holds the world at bay. Not all survived the culling, for stumps stand sentinel, reminders of what was, yet still the trees outnumber those down the street. \n\nBeyond my home, another street runs, 43rd, its visage less kind. The sidewalks crumble and the buildings wear their age like a shroud. Here are trees too, perhaps to cloak the decay. Crime finds purchase in the complex down the street, but it’s not the only one to blame. Across from me, another den of transience, where people come and go like the turning of a page. Yet I find solace where I am, for it is within my means, and the conveniences gather around me like old friends. The university is but a short walk, and two bus stops stand ready to carry me to the store or to the heart of the city with ease.",
            "The street runs in a circle, a cul-de-sac where duplexes stand like solitary sentinels, their facades washed in the same sunbaked yellow. Each wears a white porch like a collar and a green metal roof that gleams under the sky's indifferent blue gaze. These are not just houses but homes, tethered by the thin thread of friendly discourse, neighbors gathering at the cusp of driveways to share words as the sun dips low, their children painting the world with chalk or chasing the wind with kites. It is a place out of time, where the mechanical hum of modernity seems but a distant echo.\n\nFields and trees shoulder the neighborhood, standing sentinel beneath the vast sky where clouds billow like sails on a forgotten sea. Yet there is a darkness that looms. This season the air is thick with the promise of storms, sirens wailing their ghostly warning. Last night the sound came, a siren's keen lament, and we sought the refuge of our shelters. I sat in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my large dog paced the living room, restless as the storm itself. The world outside was silent but for the hail's ferocious tattoo upon the earth. \n\nWhen at last the storm relented, the road exhaled steam, a ghostly breath from the sudden shift in temperature. The heat refused to yield, and the hail melted upon the pavement's embrace. Above, the sky began to clear, and the sun's fingers reached down through the rain, painting a double rainbow upon the canvas of the heavens. I ran for my camera, capturing the fleeting wonder to share with those distant through the cold glass screen. They marveled, and so did I. \n\nThe quiet held the streets in its arms for a time, until the world awoke and life returned, mothers calling their children in as dinner simmered. It is a place of kindness, this new home of mine, far from where I once stood in New Hampshire. The southern drawl wraps around words like a warm shawl. I reside in a two-bedroom place, as do all here, though within each the space changes, some rooms shrinking into themselves. It is a mystery. \n\nBehind my dwelling, a great field stretches out, a green expanse leading to a pond that forbids the caress of swimmers. Deer wander there, and in the morning the bullfrog's song rises like a hymn. It is a good place to live, a mere forty minutes from the city's pulse. The dawn is heralded by roosters crowing from nearby farms, a call to a new day. A donkey brays in the evening, reminding us all of our place in this small village-like world. I have found a jewel in this place, a sanctuary in the southern soil.",
            "In the long years since I first set foot here, the years that have come and gone like pages blown across a field, I reckon I’ve learned a thing or two. I recall the sorrow that took hold of me when we left Riverdale. The tears I shed as we departed for Stockbridge, a place unknown and unwelcome then. But my folks wanted better, always better, for me and my sister. The houses were finer, the schools were finer. They said it wasn’t ghetto and that was reason enough. In time, I made peace with it, found friends and foes in equal measure at the school. The neighbors, they mostly stayed strangers, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, Dennis too, living right beside us. They've been a lot like family in their own ways and I hold them dear. I remember the day we all went to Mr. Glen’s wedding, him and Ms. Veda tying the knot anew. A day of joy and laughter, a glimpse of what I hope to find as I lay stones on my own path, dreaming of a life fit for a queen. When Ms. Veda tossed that little white garter, it was me who caught it, though the flowers slipped through my fingers. We danced till the stars wore thin, Marsharii and me. Haven’t seen her since. Hope she's found her own way. The neighborhood, it’s a tangle of streets and turns, though these days I’ve got a GPS to guide me. I’ve wandered a bit, mostly with Kason and Curtis, my companions in the art of idling. We played our games, lived our lives with a fervor only youth can muster. Sometimes I’d find my way to the park, seeking the solace only nature bestows. There’s a peace in it, a calm. I’d bring my sticks from the depot, honing balance, wielding my wooden sword against the unseen foes of the world. There’s a court for basketball and tennis, long abandoned by me but there still, waiting should the urge to play return. My father, he taught us tennis alongside Mr. Graves. We sweated and laughed under the sun’s watchful eye. There’s stories aplenty, tales of joy and hardship woven into the fabric of this place. And yet, I feel the best is still to come, waiting just beyond the horizon.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town unassuming in its quietude, a place where the world seems to slow and the dust settles gently on the roadways. Johnston, they call it, a name that whispers through the fields of peach and cattle. Claiming its fame as the Peach Capital of the World, its sign stands with a pride that belies its simplicity, welcoming all who wander through its borders. The land is vast and open, a patchwork of farms and fields, where the earth yields its bounty under the relentless sun. The houses, when they appear, sit back from the road, nestled in the embrace of their own expanse, roofs of metal or shingle guarding against the summer's wrath. \n\nIn the heart of the town, a lone stoplight marks the crossroad, casting its red and green upon the handful of stores that stand resolute. A Chinese place called Hong Kong, a fiesta of Mexican fare, and Gary's burgers offer their fast relief to weary travelers. Once, there was a pizzeria, but its doors have long since closed, leaving behind only the memory of its warmth. A pharmacy named Maxwell and Halford Drug persists, known not for its remedies but for the cherry cola that flows sweet and sticky from its coolers. The IGA stands as the sole purveyor of groceries, though its aisles see fewer feet, as many choose the journey to Walmart in distant Batesburg-Leesville.\n\nYet, it is Dollar General that draws the town's life to it, a marketplace of necessity where the rhythm of commerce beats steady from dawn till dusk. Nearby, a furniture store, Possibilities, remains a testament to endurance, its owner a fixture in the tapestry of Johnston's people. And beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a sanctuary for creatures great and small, offers its gentle care.\n\nThe town's edges hold a doctor’s office and a veterinary practice, small sanctuaries of healing for the folks who call this place home. The children gather at Johnston Elementary, their laughter and learning confined until the fifth grade, whereupon they must journey to a neighboring town for further schooling. No parks grace this land yet, though plans unfurl for a modest stretch of recreation to bring life to its soil.\n\nThere is little to occupy one's time here, no theaters or lanes for bowling, no places for idle gatherings, yet the town holds its charm in the whispers of its streets and the stories of its soil. It is a place so small you might pass it by, a mere blink and gone, yet within its bounds lies a world entire, quiet and enduring.",
            "In the heart of a small southern town in Tennessee, I find myself settled in a suburb like many others. The street runs between two state highways, and it draws more traffic than one might care for, but beyond that, the neighborhood rests in a kind of quietude. Folks around here don't come and go much, and so the faces remain familiar, each etched into the landscape like the trees that stand sentinel over us. Busy with their yards and the daily grind of living, they pass the seasons in simple labors. Winter sees children sledding down the hill by the side street, their laughter carried on the cold air. Our house sits at the front corner, and from there, we watch the world slide by, noting the cars, the strangers among them, a measure of vigilance we all keep. Neighbors walk their dogs or themselves, and children roam on bikes as if tethered to the past.\n\nOur days revolve around this place, home in more ways than one, for work ties us to its walls. Four of us fill its rooms—myself, my wife, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen. We weave ourselves into the fabric of this street, coming and going as thread through a loom. Sometimes, we spill out into the rain, oblivious to its chill, and the grill on the back deck sends sweet smoke into the world, a scent that blends with the incessant hum of lawnmowers from March till October when the grass gives up its growth. The trees here are plentiful, remnants of the forest that once was, and they cast their shadows long. But come fall, they shed their leaves, and we rake them into piles to burn. The scent of burning leaves is a harbinger of the season, a reminder that fall has taken hold.\n\nThe winters of late do not bite as they once did, leaving autumn to linger in their stead. Our garage, tucked at the back of the house, sees more use than the front door. It's there I work on my truck or tinker with whatever project calls to me, the open doors a window into the life that unfolds beyond. Holidays bring a hush over the street, except for the swell of cars when families gather from afar. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas, each marks its time with the arrival of visitors. In all of it, there is a sense of belonging, and though the road runs through, it feels like home enough. If only it were a road that ended, it might be perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where the earth sprawls in the eternal embrace of dust and sand, my neighborhood rests in a quiet defiance against time. The land is a tapestry of brown, a hue that stretches to the horizons, and only those who call this place home truly grasp the omnipresence of this color. Green lawns are a rarity, a testament to fortunes spent on coaxing life from the arid soil. Back in the nineties, the houses lay scattered like seeds sown by a wandering hand, and though the years have passed, the earth remains much the same, albeit dotted now with new constructions rising like stubborn monuments. This place, it grows more akin to a city with each passing day, a fate shared by many lands in this changing world. \n\nThe folk here, they carry the warmth of the desert sun, mostly kind, though like any city, shadows linger in corners. My own street harbors the elderly, gentle souls who mark this as a place of neighborly grace. The stores are those of chains, familiar names like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For finer fare, one must journey afar; Whole Foods and such are strangers in these parts. The work that draws men here is the building of things, for this city is yet unfinished, vast spaces waiting to be claimed by the hands of men. It holds a certain dread for me, this march of progress, for I fled the clamor of a great city and have no wish to return. \n\nConstruction is my trade, the art of drywall and T-bar, and in this craft, I find my daily bread. Yet what endears this place to me, beyond the toil, is the life that thrives despite the harshness. The desert is a canvas painted with creatures that dart and scuttle, a wonderland for my children who chase lizards and beetles under the unyielding sun. High desert climes forge ecosystems both fragile and fierce, demanding respect from those who dwell here. We, my kin and I, have learned to live in harmony with these wild neighbors. \n\nIn our town, attractions are few but cherished. Victorville, it stands as a gateway to the desert's embrace, offering families a taste of its rugged beauty. The annual San Bernardino County Fair breathes life into our days, a carnival of joy and simple pleasures. Beyond, the mountains of Wrightwood beckon, their snow-clad peaks a siren's call to those seeking winter's touch. For those drawn to the stories of earth and man, the Victor Valley Museum holds tales of stone and bone, of the people who carved their lives into this unforgiving land.\n\nThus, in this arid cradle, life persists, a testament to resilience, and in its quiet persistence, I find a certain peace.",
            "In the waking hours when the light is yet faint and the world trembles on the brink of another day’s unfolding, I reckon my neighborhood in a way perhaps less common, less known. Others might speak of tidy houses in a row, each with its own tale and hearth, but mine is a sprawl of academic halls and dormitories, the college grounds my own peculiar province. The people who dwell here, they form the heart of my community, though beyond the brick and mortar they too stretch, like the branches of some ancient tree, into the wider campus, which serves as my neighborhood in its own wild and unyielding way. \n\nIt is the same and yet not the same as the neighborhoods of old with their quiet streets and corner stores. Here too are places of dwelling, people moving like shadows across the green, stores with their wares, and parks with their solemn retreat. Let me lay before you the dwellings that mark this place. There are three kinds as I know them: apartments, houses, and the dormitory halls. \n\nThe apartments, they stack and rise like books upon a shelf, each room holding two to four souls, and floors numbering two, maybe more. Twenty souls or so gather in such a space, living, breathing, learning. Then there are the houses, a rare thing, scattered like seeds among the grounds, filled often with alumni, those who once were and now remain tied to the school’s embrace. \n\nBut most common are the dormitories, vast and teeming, where hundreds lay their heads, sharing rooms, sharing lives, in a community that pulses and shifts like the tide. \n\nIn this place, diversity is the law, as unyielding as gravity. Faces from all corners of the earth find themselves here, drawn to this place of learning. The staff find refuge in houses, the young ones in dormitories, and the elder students, wiser perhaps, in the apartments. \n\nThe people defy description, each a world unto themselves, and so let us speak instead of the stores and parks. This college, this self-contained universe, holds within it all manner of stores, from those that feed the body to those that clothe it, unique in their offerings yet familiar, the scent of academia upon them. \n\nAnd the park, a refuge amidst the stone and glass, is a gathering place for the diverse souls, a sanctuary kept safe by the hands of the community, clean and free from the shadows that plague the world beyond. \n\nIn this place, everything needed lies within reach, the boundaries of the neighborhood holding all things fast, as if in the embrace of a world entire.",
            "In the place where I live sidewalks are a rarity. All things seem to flow downward, cresting at the house at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill. Joggers test their mettle against its incline, running up the narrow road where the pavement bears the scars of time and weather. Pits and ruts that make for treacherous driving. The telephone and electric wires drape from pole to pole, tattered and forlorn. Storms rage in this country, and the wind and the rain bring down branches that strike at the lines. Repairs leave them a patchwork shamble. Tall evergreens rise everywhere about, though folks here despise them. They cut them down to clear the view of the ocean, building their homes high atop the hill with great glass walls to drink in the vista of the bay. At sunset, when the light beneath the waves ignites and the sky burns orange, it is a beauty that wounds the soul. Yet more often than not clouds hang low, and the sun's rays come filtered through a haze. Days are damp and overcast, and moss creeps over every surface it can claim: roofs and cars and railings alike. I left my car in the drive for a month and when I returned it was green and furred with moss, and it took hours to scrape it clean.  \n\nChildren are few in these parts, despite the school not far off. The neighbors are mostly older, retired, their lawns populated by dogs in place of offspring. The dogs roam free, racing down the street, and if a door or window is left ajar they may slip inside. I found one in the living room once, had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits run wild, too, and some grow large, digging up the roots of plants, burrowing into lawns, much to the gardeners' dismay. My cats hunt them with a vengeance, driving them from our vicinity. Birds flit about, sparrows and hummingbirds, with the hawks and eagles sometimes swooping low until the crows rise to chase them off.  \n\nThere's no store nearby, but if you head down the hill toward the waterfront, you'll find a handful of restaurants serving fresh catch. The beach is scant, more rock than sand, but the stones make for good throwing into the bay, which is not wide. Even through the mist you can see the far shore, a line across the water, constant and unyielding.",
            "In the sprawling cityscape of New York, there's a place called Bensonhurst. It's not hard to find, not with public transportation weaving through like sinews in a great beast. This urban enclave holds all the chaos and vibrancy of the city itself. Walk the streets and you'll meet the eyes of the Asian storefronts, a testament to the waves of souls who came seeking something on these shores. Two decades of change have painted the neighborhood in new colors, the lines of its face altered yet familiar.\n\nThe markets and laundromats—they stand sentinel on each block, their doors open to the world. The food is good, the prices fair, and convenience reigns supreme in this corner of the city. In a stretch no longer than a child's laughter, four supermarkets cater to the needs of the people. This is Bensonhurst, diverse in its bones and sinews, with generations of immigrants mingling among the streets. The businesses, large and small, ripple with the influence of their Asian proprietors, shaping the rhythm of daily life.\n\nThere's a park nearby, where the city's children run free. Ten basketball courts, fields wide enough for the dreams of soccer and baseball, handball walls to echo the slap of a ball. Swings and a playground offer respite, and in the heat of summer, a fountain becomes a haven. Here, the fabric of humanity is as varied as the city itself, each stitch a different hue.\n\nBuildings rise here and there, co-ops and condos, but mostly it's the houses, two families to a plot, that hold the stories of the people. The air is alive with sound, music blaring from cars, engines roaring in the dawn. It's a noisy place, but the noise is life. Yet, when night falls, you must tread carefully. The streets can turn on you, and in their shadows lurk the unpredictable. Memories of assaults long past and packages pilfered from doorsteps linger like ghosts.\n\nThe city's rules are a whisper against the wind. Fines for unheeded norms, for the mess left by dogs on their morning rounds. You walk, eyes cast downward, wary of where you place your feet. It's the smallest things that can unsettle you, the little grievances that gnaw at the edges of your peace. In Bensonhurst, as in all places, you find the good and the less so, side by side, as the city goes on, ever living, ever changing.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, there's a thread you must grasp to understand its soul, and that thread is called \"weird.\" Painted bold on the backside of a building—a place that wears many masks as a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, and skirts the edges of the law—is the town's unofficial creed: \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, it echoes a lament for the Portland of yesteryears, the nineties and early two-thousands, a city less known, less burdened by cost, a crucible of creativity and subcultures. For others, it's a siren call—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is not a slur but a badge of honor. Even as the city swells with newcomers from California, the skyline crammed with condominiums to house them, Portland remains steadfastly weird. Yet, weird does not always embrace; it simply lets things be that which they usually are not. It does not mean we shun modernity or the battles it brings. Like the rest of the land, we import our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to flout the norm, yet Portland is no stranger to the mundane. It's a city of yoga and hipsters and suited professionals. Perhaps to be weird here is to carry it all with a lighter heart. My neighborhood, like many, is a tapestry of painted houses and gardens that spill over with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, where free boxes sprout like wildflowers in the summer. These boxes, humble cardboard or plastic, offer up their contents to the wanderer—a gift, a treasure meant for the one who finds it. They hold clothes and books, sometimes more, sometimes less, but always a promise of serendipity. This is the magic of walking through a Southeast Portland street—that is, what it means to me, though I am but one shade in a spectrum of weird. Among us, some would never stoop to pick their clothes from a sidewalk box. They seek their strangeness in goat yoga or the roaring stands of Timbers matches. Portland is a haven for those who love their passions fiercely, whether they chase dreams or find them at the bottom of a glass in a dim-lit bar. Yes, we have our demons. Drugs seep through the city like rain through the gutters, their root often in the mind's shadows, fed by the endless rain and the gray sky's weight. Homelessness is a specter that haunts us, a puzzle with no easy answer. Our city's hands stretch out with services, better than most, yet never enough, like elsewhere. Between care and disdain, we sway, and in this we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stood eternal in their northern fastness, bearing witness to the sun's rites at every dawn and dusk, indifferent to the stirrings of man or the petty tides of his days. They watched, unblinking, as I moved through the world below, their presence a constant, immutable truth. In times of turmoil, when life pressed upon me with its myriad demands, they summoned my gaze, demanding to be seen, offering a moment's respite to my restless soul. It was here I came as a young scholar, drawn to the university nestled in their shadow. The mountains claimed me first, their majesty eclipsing the allure of the stately buildings and tranquil ponds of the campus. The town, too, held its charms, a tapestry of quaint cafés where many a night was spent in caffeine-induced study. A short journey brought one to the heart of the town, where the faded bricks of old buildings whispered of a history rich and enduring. Here, the town pulsed with the vigor of life, a brief mimicry of the bustling city nearby, yet all too soon it yielded back to the quietude of its suburban soul. This dance of contrasts, the city's restless energy and the town's serene quietude, invited exploration and the weaving of memories. There were nights spent wandering, laughter echoing past rusty swings, or racing through the vibrant streets to catch a show, the tickets a gift from the university. Yet, the town also bore witness to life's harsher truths, as all places must. The ponds, especially, became a refuge for reflection or the silent tears of existential doubt in the small hours. I found myself pondering my place in the great tapestry of life, watching the turtles and ducks and insects, each playing their part. And so I walked, past the pond and park and the rows of houses steeped in suburban quiet, until I reached the main street. The sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, the sky a canvas of blue and yellow, and I realized my steps had led me northward. There they were, the mountains, steadfast and towering, grazing the sky with their ancient forms. In their silent strength, they stirred within me a will to endure.",
            "In the dim shade of a sun-baked afternoon, you might pass it by without a second thought. Just a residential area, lurking behind a tattered shopping strip, not the sort of place one would reckon folks lay their heads. Surely not the sort of place most would choose. Yet, if your feet lead you past the derelict husk of the old Whole Foods and beyond the weary hotels standing empty but for those scattered summer gatherings, you'll stumble upon a hidden hive of life. Streets lined with apartment blocks, standing shoulder to shoulder, like Russian dolls meticulously disassembled and placed out in a solemn procession along the road. The first of these buildings, infamous from the news, speak of dealings best left unspoken. Appearances, they are deceptive things. Yet, in the shadow of these, the remaining complexes hold a world unknown to those who wander these parts. Across from them, the community college's satellite campus sits, a cluster of sleepy edifices, guarding the road. Students drift in with coffee clutched close, eyes heavy with the dawn, starting their days in a drowsy haze. The iron gates creak and groan, letting them in, one by one, as the commuters curse and gnash their teeth, the traffic swells and ebbs with the morning tide.  \n\nThe road ends at a crossroads, where a park sprawls on one side and a rehabilitation center, a haven for those with bones fractured by fate, stands on the other. Its porch hosts cheerful furniture, and the ceiling fan turns slow, stirring the thick summer air like a gentle hand through water. Children dart and dance across the park's grassy expanse, limbs flailing joyously among the bees that buzz 'round the flowers. Retirees walk dogs along the path, eyes narrowed at the skateboarders, nodding politely at the teenage girls, who whisper of boys and the latest YouTube idols. Nearby, a sushi joint sits in the strip mall’s embrace, serving modest fare to sparse crowds. A swimming supply store clings close beside, a nail salon nestled between. One could ready a pool, manicure nails, and feast on hibachi chicken all in one breath—the strange allure of the strip mall. A frozen yogurt place too, where teens from the park clutch chilled cups, adorned with toppings, as they skate and vape, chasing the ghost of cool. This neighborhood, a slice of Americana, a relic of the languid South where time drifts slow, like the smoke from a distant fire.",
            "The neighborhood's a place of quiet mystery, a tapestry of single-family homes interwoven with those split in twain yet bound together, a strange harmony that makes a kind of sense. Our house stands with its small yard in the fore and a narrow drive to the left, a relic of a time when the suburbs promised the American dream, that once-sweet embrace now turned away, leaving us to grasp what remains. Yet the neighborhood endures, calling out in its mute way that the dream lives still, clung to by those who wander its streets. The folk here, they've lost some of the shine in their eyes, their yards untended as once they weren't, but cars still grace the drives, and children run and shout, their games the whole of their world.\n\nThe old public school, nearing a century, stands firm, conjuring futures for the young and stirring memories in the old. Churches, sparse and echoing, stand mostly empty, but the basketball courts still resound with life. Each home bears its own face yet they echo one another, a chorus of sameness. Super \"A,\" the supermarket, is held by a Yemeni family, the sole Arabs in this place where most folk are African American. Wide streets stretch out, fields for children playing football, pausing only for passing cars.\n\nGenerations have walked these streets, tales of a time when all knew each other spoken in the quiet of porches. There was a karate school once, but as Hollywood's tales of the Karate Kid faded, so did the children's dreams, and now it's a pharmacy, for such are the times. A small theater shows old films, shunned by the young for lack of new spectacle, but cherished by elders, a bargain for a night away from the clamor.\n\nAn expressway cuts through, its exits lying beyond our reach, the youth having clamored for their own gateway, a notion the elders quashed, fearing it would mar what we have. Now a new high school rises, and in it, a choice for a mascot. I think of a cyborg with a country twang, a cabin of logs, a fitting emblem for this place of ours.",
            "In the sprawl of this city, the neighborhood winds through a tapestry of lives and places, each thread distinct yet woven into the whole. The city breathes with the cadence of its diversity, blocks lined with dwellings that stand amidst the scatter of businesses, each pursuing its own commerce under the vast indifferent sky. Here, in this labyrinth of streets, restaurants rise like sentinels offering their fare, while shops both grand and humble beckon all who wander by. The boutiques, with their small windows and whispered promises, nestle beside the giants of corporate commerce, their shadows stretching across pavements that lead to parks where parents watch their children at play, laughter echoing in the open air.\n\nThe people of this place are as varied as the city itself. Each face tells a story, and they gather in communities, each with its own pulse. Here, a vibrant LGBTQ+ community flourishes beside the solemnity of Orthodox Jewish life, and nearby, the echoes of the former Soviet Union linger in the voices of refugees and immigrants. Beyond these borders, the city stretches wide, where each district bears the stamp of those who call it home—Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—all within a stone's throw yet separated by the slow crawl of traffic that chokes the city's arteries.\n\nFew choose to walk the endless streets, for the city sprawls far and wide, and the vehicles claim the roads with their ceaseless noise. Construction cranes swing their long arms, raising new towers into the skyline, drawing more souls to this crowded land. The residents watch, some with hope, others with wary eyes, for the roads groan beneath the weight of so many, and the hunt for a place to rest one's car is a trial unto itself.\n\nYet within this chaos lies choice. There are houses and homes, spread across the city in their multitude of forms. Large apartments rise like cliffs, but for those who seek the quiet, there are smaller buildings, single-family homes, and duplexes that hold their ground against the encroaching tide. Here too, the people differ, each age and story a part of the city's fabric. But the bonds that once tied neighbor to neighbor have weakened, and the streets remember a time when children's laughter filled the air, when the games of youth bound them together in camaraderie beneath the watchful gaze of long-vanished summers.",
            "Where's everything? she said as we rolled through the endless cornfields, the horizon swallowed whole by the stalks. This is it, I told her, knowing the vastness would leave her stunned. She came from a place where the grocery store lay but a five-minute stroll away—never had she seen such open sky. Awash in the sameness of corn, I spoke of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew me and the soil from which I came. The road stretched on, a narrow country lane, till it met a quarry filled with water, and just beyond, the small settlement that was home. These houses, brick and stucco, each resting on their half-acre plots, land that folks here took pride in tending. Come spring, flowers burst forth, and trees of the Midwest donned their seasonal dress. Driveways lined with gleaming Mercedes, their chrome bright under the noonday sun after a careful wash.\n\nOnward we drove toward my gray stucco home, past my Korean neighbor with his ever-present smile. He spent his days on the mower, his song rising above its drone, a man whose humor had softened with age. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and the hum of his John Deere. The neighborhood chuckled at his antics, but he was genuine, a soul with stories to tell. At last, my home. In the side yard, geese wandered, pursued by our Terrier. Out back, a stream fed the quarry, its voice mingling with the bullfrog's call and the distant lowing of cattle.\n\nAcross the bridge I built by hand lay an untouched oasis, wild with trees and herbs and flowers never planted. Here was the ground of my childhood, building forts in the trees, chasing creatures more imagined than real. Always something to do, a neighbor child to join in play. Winters came hard in our small town, the kind that cut to the bone, but they brought a beauty all their own. The land, once green, turned stark and bare, the trees mere skeletons against the sky. Snow fell sometimes, and overnight the world transformed, a winter's dream. The backyard filled with snow angels, my sister's hand in their making, and snowmen stood sentry. We fought often as children, my sister and I, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen arms. Our forts were grand, igloos built of branches, housing our arsenal. In that frozen world, we played at life, nothing beyond our make-believe mattered. We were children, unburdened by the weight of the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the quiet heart of rural America, in a small town in Michigan where the land shifts from sprawling farmland to quaint tourist enclaves, there are no sprawling city malls or chains of commerce like Wal-Mart or Target or even an Applebee's. Here, journeys are measured in miles, and the roads lead you through a landscape kissed by water's edge. The town, my place in this world, is held in the embrace of water. To one side the vastness of Lake Michigan, to the other, the more intimate Lake Charlevoix, each offering their beaches where one might wade in the cool embrace of the waves.\n\nThe neighborhood here speaks of small-town life, where houses breathe with space, not stacked like bricks in a wall but standing alone, each with its own story. They are not the uniform creations of modern times but homes of another era, some renewed, others holding the patina of years. These homes stand with basements that show their faces to the road, and many are clad in the old armor of aluminum siding, their colors as varied as the leaves in autumn. Yards spread out before them, dotted with trampolines and playsets, gardens where the earth yields its bounty, and fences that hold back the creatures of the household.\n\nThis place is Middle America, where the people work by the sweat of their brows, raising families or having seen their children grow and leave. The streets are alive with the laughter of children, the rhythmic slap of dog paws, the hum of bicycles and the whisper of rollerblades. Neighbors nod to neighbors, and the strangers are known by the absence of recognition. A wave to a man at the grill, a smile to the woman walking a dog from far down the block. The lawns are neat, the grass clipped and green, leaves not left to gather and rot. It is not a neighborhood that dazzles with its beauty, but one that comforts with its promise—a place where families are raised in the quiet certainty of peace, a sanctuary at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s station stands watch, the health department close by, the city’s recycling center a stone’s throw away, all serving the people here. The fields of baseball and softball echo with the announcer’s calls, the small town airport abuzz with the drone of engines as small planes rise and fall in the sky. An ice cream shop beckons within a stroll, and the downtown’s heart can be reached by foot from this circle of homes. My children ride their bikes to a park not far off, a mere eight blocks away. It is a good place, a fine place to call home.",
            "The land where I find myself is a place of sameness, a tract of earth where houses stand in neat rows like soldiers at attention, each one a mirror to the next. Here the hand of the homeowner’s association is felt keen and sharp, shaping the world to its will. The lawns are clipped and tidy, a green uniformity broken only by stones set in patterns and the occasional tree, stunted and solitary. In the driveways, cars sit in pairs, sheltered beneath the roofs of twin garages. The streets themselves are smooth as glass, unmarred by the scars of time or neglect. No cracks, no holes. Just the unbroken sweep of new-laid concrete.\n\nThe houses rise mostly in single story, though here and there a second floor reaches skyward, an anomaly amid the conformity. There are no mailboxes before each door. Instead, at the street’s end, a cluster of metal boxes waits, keys in hand, to unlock the letters and packages within. The HOA has seen to this, their desire for order manifest in little things.\n\nWe stand at the city's edge, this place neither fully rural nor wholly suburban, but a blending of both. The land spreads wide and open, with room enough for pools where the water shivers under the sun, and trails that wind through the quiet, waiting for the feet of those who walk alone or with a dog at heel. The old come here to rest, their days measured in the slow drift of time. The young are fewer, but they are here too, mingling with their elders.\n\nThe city beyond is a contradiction, vast in its number but small in its heart. It has all that one might need, though never too much. A mall stands solitary, humble in its offerings, yet enough to serve. To reach the stores and the life of the city takes but a short drive, and once there, all the world unfolds. The rich foods and the cheap, the grand shops and the small. It is a place where needs are met, and yet, this is a world that asks nothing more than to be as it is. Safe and kept, a piece of the whole, and nothing more.",
            "The first I heard tell of the place was from a voice on a podcast, recounting tales of souls who had vanished into the ether. It took me by surprise. Here was a world where each apartment fetched over a thousand dollars a month and yet this story was unknown to me and mine. Perhaps it is the struggle. I know friends who lay awake in the night, eyes wet with tears. Life is dear, but we have learned to scrape by, finding beauty in the dust of flea market toys and clothes long packed away. The scent of adulthood is like a dusty magazine stacked upon a forgotten piano. It seeps into the leather and lingers long after the washing is done. Here, within a stone’s throw, lie three thrift stores. If you begin at one end, you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a hive, cars and people thronging the streets with the dawn, yet within the thrift stores, silence reigns. No matter how many souls pass by, the quiet holds. It’s a fine spot to while away the hours. Each year, the flood of cars and people grows. They call it a city in bloom, headquarters to one of the great online empires. It bears the scars of its growth still. It recalls New York to mind. Each person, each thing, pursues its own end, and not much is asked of you. You can keep to yourself, be still and silent, and folks will let you be. Unlike the South, where a touch of concern shows care, here lives go unexamined. You can maintain your shell as long as you wish, and the city will rise and fall like waves upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound. Between the pianist next door and the singers above, there’s always a tune in the air. In a fashion, we are less strangers in apartments and more a circle of friends. We gather for our needs, mark the passing of years, grieve and celebrate together, and lend a hand when we can. I count myself fortunate to be here. My neighbors are a good sort, and they treat me kindly. I keep the place tidy, share what I can, and they return the favor. We exchange letters and visits. It’s a simple pleasure, seeing them, and I believe they find some joy in my company as well. I dwell in this vast, impersonal expanse of modernity, yet it is the likes of my neighbors who make me feel perhaps I have not squandered my days entirely.",
            "In a small town perched on the edge of the city’s sprawl, where the east wind carries whispers of better times, I dwell. This place, neither forgotten nor entirely remembered, lies where the suburbs end and the earth begins to reclaim its own. The east side, where I make my home, is a patchwork of weary houses. Their paint long since faded, homes to souls who wrestle with an invisible hand that keeps their dreams tethered low to the ground. Yet the people are not without their grace. Faces that greet you with the warmth of a weary sun, nodding as you pass, their smiles worn but sincere. \n\nHere, the specter of crime lurks in the shadows, a part of the place like wind through the empty branches, though it seldom shows its face. In the decade past, violence has struck like sudden summer storms, leaving behind a silence more profound than before. Last year, the family next door lost their boy to a gunshot, a life ended outside the dim glow of a tavern’s neon promise. Our own steps have been lighter, with only the occasional loss of small things left too long on the porch, a reminder of the precarious peace we hold.\n\nThis town bears the scars of the opioid plague, a tragedy too great to be borne in silence. Lives extinguished by the quiet poison of fentanyl, their absence felt in the spaces they no longer fill. Yet in this darkness, there is light. Places of healing, where the lost might find their way back, and hands reaching out with the knowledge of Narcan, offering a lifeline where hope had faltered.\n\nIn the midst of these tribulations, the town holds fast to its virtues. My son’s school, a haven of laughter and learning, where kindness is the currency and differences are celebrated rather than scorned. The staff, from the principal's steady hand to the teachers’ guiding voices, create a world where he feels safe, loved. Events weave the families together, a tapestry of community and connection, each thread stronger for its neighbor.\n\nThough the weight of poverty hangs heavy, no child is left to hunger. The school ensures every one eats, breaking bread with dignity, the meals a daily act of grace. The burdens of fees and trips are lightened, allowing each child to walk unencumbered by want. The City Council, in their wisdom, has breathed new life into the heart of the town. Roads smooth as river stones, parks where laughter echoes, though the east side remains a landscape of neglect, its needs overshadowed by the commerce-driven west.\n\nYet I find solace here. The faces familiar, the kindnesses small but genuine. The shops sufficient to clothe and feed us, the house a haven, humble but ours. Sixteen years have passed in this place, our roots entwined with the earth beneath. We cannot imagine another land, another home. This town, flawed and beautiful, is where we belong.",
            "The neighborhood lies sprawled across the hill, a place thick with stories and shadows. High above, the buildings stand, sentinels of history, with their facades etched by time. I reside in a seven-story edifice, staring out at the old theater, its presence a whisper of yesteryear's grandeur. Down the slope, a block away, sits a vibrant arcade bar where souls of all kinds gather like moths to a flame on those balmy summer eves. When June turns to July, the line stretches long and winding, a testament to the life that pulses here. The park, a stone’s throw north, sprawls wide, a hidden oasis amidst the city's concrete heart. In winter’s chill, the homeless find solace, raising their tents in ordered lines upon the pavement and steps. The snow seldom falls, but the rain, it comes in sheets, a relentless curtain that chills to the bone. They huddle close, seeking warmth in the city's core, near the family center where they might wash away the cold.\n\nYet it is not the buildings nor the bygone elegance that holds my heart. It is the people, the culture, alive in every face and every corner. Hilltop, once notorious, carries the weight of its past in stories whispered through alleys and across generations. They speak of a time when the government swept through, a storm trying to cleanse the streets. The people remember, and they pass these tales on, even to newcomers like me. Though the streets still bear the scars, the community strives to keep them clean, to hold onto hope. They say if your skin is pale, the night is not yours in Hilltop. But this warning is a ghost, an echo of old fears. Perhaps I am dark enough to blend, or maybe I am simply a child of Hilltop, aware of the shadows that linger, the reminders of a world not yet healed. Here, racism and fear still weave their threads, even in this supposed melting pot.\n\nYet no matter where I wander, Hilltop calls to me. The night streets are alive, and in them, I find my place. The people are kind, offering warmth instead of harm. The laundromat stays open for me to find shelter from the storm. And on the bleakest nights, when I imagine myself unseen, someone will pause, look into my eyes, press a bill into my hand, and remind me of my worth. In this place, I am home.",
            "I came to this place when the world was just opening up to me at the start of eighth grade. There was a solitude in those first days, a quiet unfamiliarity that lingered like a shadow, but soon the silence gave way to voices and the faces of friends. There were two of them, living near as the crow flies, their laughter and stories becoming a part of the air I breathed. They've since gone on to other places, yet their presence remains etched in the corners of memory. The people who greeted me at the outset are still here, their lives woven into the fabric of this suburban expanse.\n\nThe neighborhood sprawls like a tapestry of two-story homes. On weekends, when the sun warms the earth, the voices of children rise up, a chorus of innocence carried on the breeze. The weekdays whisper a different music, one of stillness and the quiet hum of life passing by. Here, in this enclave, troubles are few, and solitude is a choice, not a sentence. Packages left on doorsteps remain untouched, a testament to a trust that binds one neighbor to the next.\n\nA stone's throw from my door lies a park, a realm of recollections. It's a place where the echoes of basketballs and footballs linger, where victories and defeats played out beneath the wide sky. It holds both laughter and pain, like the time a misstep left me with a bloody nose. Yet even that memory, sharp as it was, is softened by the warmth of so many afternoons spent in the company of friends. Now, the park is a domain I share with my cousin's children, their joy tangible as they swing and slide, the world a wonder to their eyes.\n\nThis neighborhood speaks in many tongues, its diversity a testament to the life it holds. Within a short stretch of road, the scents of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian kitchens mingle, though many now turn to the convenience of meals brought to their door by unseen hands. Fast food joints, ubiquitous in their presence, share the streets with pizza parlors, each offering a slice of familiarity. The stores, varied and plentiful, stand ready to meet every need. A Walgreens and a CVS stand sentinel on the main thoroughfare, alongside a Jewel-Osco, the Midwest's contribution to the grocery world. Even the stores reflect the neighborhood's mosaic, as an Indian-owned shop offers both homemade and ready-made flavors from afar.\n\nIn this place, I find a quiet contentment. The stories of others, their neighborhoods filled with strife and discord, serve as a reminder of the peace I have found here. For that, I am grateful.",
            "In the shadow of the college where I study lies the neighborhood I call home, a place stitched together by apartment blocks and the occasional haunt where one might find a drink or a meal without emptying their pockets. There's a bar, newly christened, where the prices climb higher but the spirits and service remain as ever they were, not the worst a man might find. The folk here are mostly students or those of lesser means, drawn by the modest rents that beckon from the buildings, old as they may seem from without, their hearts perhaps renewed. Children spill from the nearby school, their laughter carried on the wind, and though I see my neighbors, I know them not nor wish to, their habits of smoke and weed a jest to my boyfriend and I, what with the management’s crude attempt at masking the scent with air fresheners. \n\nDown the way stand new apartments, shiny and false, their very walls a testament to haste and thrift, yet they demand a king's ransom for rent. A scam it seems, yet they thrive on their proximity to campus, luring tenants with their glittering facade. There's a place, not five minutes on foot, where food comes on paper plates and the microwave hums its sad tune, a testament to cheap sustenance. Across lies a gas station, whispered about in tones that speak of hardship. But the summer past brought change to the road, a gift from the city that laid down wide sidewalks and green medians, a touch of grace upon the land, though my building stands ensconced in trees, a grove that holds the world at bay. Not all survived the culling, for stumps stand sentinel, reminders of what was, yet still the trees outnumber those down the street. \n\nBeyond my home, another street runs, 43rd, its visage less kind. The sidewalks crumble and the buildings wear their age like a shroud. Here are trees too, perhaps to cloak the decay. Crime finds purchase in the complex down the street, but it’s not the only one to blame. Across from me, another den of transience, where people come and go like the turning of a page. Yet I find solace where I am, for it is within my means, and the conveniences gather around me like old friends. The university is but a short walk, and two bus stops stand ready to carry me to the store or to the heart of the city with ease.",
            "The street runs in a circle, a cul-de-sac where duplexes stand like solitary sentinels, their facades washed in the same sunbaked yellow. Each wears a white porch like a collar and a green metal roof that gleams under the sky's indifferent blue gaze. These are not just houses but homes, tethered by the thin thread of friendly discourse, neighbors gathering at the cusp of driveways to share words as the sun dips low, their children painting the world with chalk or chasing the wind with kites. It is a place out of time, where the mechanical hum of modernity seems but a distant echo.\n\nFields and trees shoulder the neighborhood, standing sentinel beneath the vast sky where clouds billow like sails on a forgotten sea. Yet there is a darkness that looms. This season the air is thick with the promise of storms, sirens wailing their ghostly warning. Last night the sound came, a siren's keen lament, and we sought the refuge of our shelters. I sat in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my large dog paced the living room, restless as the storm itself. The world outside was silent but for the hail's ferocious tattoo upon the earth. \n\nWhen at last the storm relented, the road exhaled steam, a ghostly breath from the sudden shift in temperature. The heat refused to yield, and the hail melted upon the pavement's embrace. Above, the sky began to clear, and the sun's fingers reached down through the rain, painting a double rainbow upon the canvas of the heavens. I ran for my camera, capturing the fleeting wonder to share with those distant through the cold glass screen. They marveled, and so did I. \n\nThe quiet held the streets in its arms for a time, until the world awoke and life returned, mothers calling their children in as dinner simmered. It is a place of kindness, this new home of mine, far from where I once stood in New Hampshire. The southern drawl wraps around words like a warm shawl. I reside in a two-bedroom place, as do all here, though within each the space changes, some rooms shrinking into themselves. It is a mystery. \n\nBehind my dwelling, a great field stretches out, a green expanse leading to a pond that forbids the caress of swimmers. Deer wander there, and in the morning the bullfrog's song rises like a hymn. It is a good place to live, a mere forty minutes from the city's pulse. The dawn is heralded by roosters crowing from nearby farms, a call to a new day. A donkey brays in the evening, reminding us all of our place in this small village-like world. I have found a jewel in this place, a sanctuary in the southern soil.",
            "In the long years since I first set foot here, the years that have come and gone like pages blown across a field, I reckon I’ve learned a thing or two. I recall the sorrow that took hold of me when we left Riverdale. The tears I shed as we departed for Stockbridge, a place unknown and unwelcome then. But my folks wanted better, always better, for me and my sister. The houses were finer, the schools were finer. They said it wasn’t ghetto and that was reason enough. In time, I made peace with it, found friends and foes in equal measure at the school. The neighbors, they mostly stayed strangers, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, Dennis too, living right beside us. They've been a lot like family in their own ways and I hold them dear. I remember the day we all went to Mr. Glen’s wedding, him and Ms. Veda tying the knot anew. A day of joy and laughter, a glimpse of what I hope to find as I lay stones on my own path, dreaming of a life fit for a queen. When Ms. Veda tossed that little white garter, it was me who caught it, though the flowers slipped through my fingers. We danced till the stars wore thin, Marsharii and me. Haven’t seen her since. Hope she's found her own way. The neighborhood, it’s a tangle of streets and turns, though these days I’ve got a GPS to guide me. I’ve wandered a bit, mostly with Kason and Curtis, my companions in the art of idling. We played our games, lived our lives with a fervor only youth can muster. Sometimes I’d find my way to the park, seeking the solace only nature bestows. There’s a peace in it, a calm. I’d bring my sticks from the depot, honing balance, wielding my wooden sword against the unseen foes of the world. There’s a court for basketball and tennis, long abandoned by me but there still, waiting should the urge to play return. My father, he taught us tennis alongside Mr. Graves. We sweated and laughed under the sun’s watchful eye. There’s stories aplenty, tales of joy and hardship woven into the fabric of this place. And yet, I feel the best is still to come, waiting just beyond the horizon.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town unassuming in its quietude, a place where the world seems to slow and the dust settles gently on the roadways. Johnston, they call it, a name that whispers through the fields of peach and cattle. Claiming its fame as the Peach Capital of the World, its sign stands with a pride that belies its simplicity, welcoming all who wander through its borders. The land is vast and open, a patchwork of farms and fields, where the earth yields its bounty under the relentless sun. The houses, when they appear, sit back from the road, nestled in the embrace of their own expanse, roofs of metal or shingle guarding against the summer's wrath. \n\nIn the heart of the town, a lone stoplight marks the crossroad, casting its red and green upon the handful of stores that stand resolute. A Chinese place called Hong Kong, a fiesta of Mexican fare, and Gary's burgers offer their fast relief to weary travelers. Once, there was a pizzeria, but its doors have long since closed, leaving behind only the memory of its warmth. A pharmacy named Maxwell and Halford Drug persists, known not for its remedies but for the cherry cola that flows sweet and sticky from its coolers. The IGA stands as the sole purveyor of groceries, though its aisles see fewer feet, as many choose the journey to Walmart in distant Batesburg-Leesville.\n\nYet, it is Dollar General that draws the town's life to it, a marketplace of necessity where the rhythm of commerce beats steady from dawn till dusk. Nearby, a furniture store, Possibilities, remains a testament to endurance, its owner a fixture in the tapestry of Johnston's people. And beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a sanctuary for creatures great and small, offers its gentle care.\n\nThe town's edges hold a doctor’s office and a veterinary practice, small sanctuaries of healing for the folks who call this place home. The children gather at Johnston Elementary, their laughter and learning confined until the fifth grade, whereupon they must journey to a neighboring town for further schooling. No parks grace this land yet, though plans unfurl for a modest stretch of recreation to bring life to its soil.\n\nThere is little to occupy one's time here, no theaters or lanes for bowling, no places for idle gatherings, yet the town holds its charm in the whispers of its streets and the stories of its soil. It is a place so small you might pass it by, a mere blink and gone, yet within its bounds lies a world entire, quiet and enduring.",
            "In the heart of a small southern town in Tennessee, I find myself settled in a suburb like many others. The street runs between two state highways, and it draws more traffic than one might care for, but beyond that, the neighborhood rests in a kind of quietude. Folks around here don't come and go much, and so the faces remain familiar, each etched into the landscape like the trees that stand sentinel over us. Busy with their yards and the daily grind of living, they pass the seasons in simple labors. Winter sees children sledding down the hill by the side street, their laughter carried on the cold air. Our house sits at the front corner, and from there, we watch the world slide by, noting the cars, the strangers among them, a measure of vigilance we all keep. Neighbors walk their dogs or themselves, and children roam on bikes as if tethered to the past.\n\nOur days revolve around this place, home in more ways than one, for work ties us to its walls. Four of us fill its rooms—myself, my wife, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen. We weave ourselves into the fabric of this street, coming and going as thread through a loom. Sometimes, we spill out into the rain, oblivious to its chill, and the grill on the back deck sends sweet smoke into the world, a scent that blends with the incessant hum of lawnmowers from March till October when the grass gives up its growth. The trees here are plentiful, remnants of the forest that once was, and they cast their shadows long. But come fall, they shed their leaves, and we rake them into piles to burn. The scent of burning leaves is a harbinger of the season, a reminder that fall has taken hold.\n\nThe winters of late do not bite as they once did, leaving autumn to linger in their stead. Our garage, tucked at the back of the house, sees more use than the front door. It's there I work on my truck or tinker with whatever project calls to me, the open doors a window into the life that unfolds beyond. Holidays bring a hush over the street, except for the swell of cars when families gather from afar. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas, each marks its time with the arrival of visitors. In all of it, there is a sense of belonging, and though the road runs through, it feels like home enough. If only it were a road that ended, it might be perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where the earth sprawls in the eternal embrace of dust and sand, my neighborhood rests in a quiet defiance against time. The land is a tapestry of brown, a hue that stretches to the horizons, and only those who call this place home truly grasp the omnipresence of this color. Green lawns are a rarity, a testament to fortunes spent on coaxing life from the arid soil. Back in the nineties, the houses lay scattered like seeds sown by a wandering hand, and though the years have passed, the earth remains much the same, albeit dotted now with new constructions rising like stubborn monuments. This place, it grows more akin to a city with each passing day, a fate shared by many lands in this changing world. \n\nThe folk here, they carry the warmth of the desert sun, mostly kind, though like any city, shadows linger in corners. My own street harbors the elderly, gentle souls who mark this as a place of neighborly grace. The stores are those of chains, familiar names like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For finer fare, one must journey afar; Whole Foods and such are strangers in these parts. The work that draws men here is the building of things, for this city is yet unfinished, vast spaces waiting to be claimed by the hands of men. It holds a certain dread for me, this march of progress, for I fled the clamor of a great city and have no wish to return. \n\nConstruction is my trade, the art of drywall and T-bar, and in this craft, I find my daily bread. Yet what endears this place to me, beyond the toil, is the life that thrives despite the harshness. The desert is a canvas painted with creatures that dart and scuttle, a wonderland for my children who chase lizards and beetles under the unyielding sun. High desert climes forge ecosystems both fragile and fierce, demanding respect from those who dwell here. We, my kin and I, have learned to live in harmony with these wild neighbors. \n\nIn our town, attractions are few but cherished. Victorville, it stands as a gateway to the desert's embrace, offering families a taste of its rugged beauty. The annual San Bernardino County Fair breathes life into our days, a carnival of joy and simple pleasures. Beyond, the mountains of Wrightwood beckon, their snow-clad peaks a siren's call to those seeking winter's touch. For those drawn to the stories of earth and man, the Victor Valley Museum holds tales of stone and bone, of the people who carved their lives into this unforgiving land.\n\nThus, in this arid cradle, life persists, a testament to resilience, and in its quiet persistence, I find a certain peace.",
            "In the waking hours when the light is yet faint and the world trembles on the brink of another day’s unfolding, I reckon my neighborhood in a way perhaps less common, less known. Others might speak of tidy houses in a row, each with its own tale and hearth, but mine is a sprawl of academic halls and dormitories, the college grounds my own peculiar province. The people who dwell here, they form the heart of my community, though beyond the brick and mortar they too stretch, like the branches of some ancient tree, into the wider campus, which serves as my neighborhood in its own wild and unyielding way. \n\nIt is the same and yet not the same as the neighborhoods of old with their quiet streets and corner stores. Here too are places of dwelling, people moving like shadows across the green, stores with their wares, and parks with their solemn retreat. Let me lay before you the dwellings that mark this place. There are three kinds as I know them: apartments, houses, and the dormitory halls. \n\nThe apartments, they stack and rise like books upon a shelf, each room holding two to four souls, and floors numbering two, maybe more. Twenty souls or so gather in such a space, living, breathing, learning. Then there are the houses, a rare thing, scattered like seeds among the grounds, filled often with alumni, those who once were and now remain tied to the school’s embrace. \n\nBut most common are the dormitories, vast and teeming, where hundreds lay their heads, sharing rooms, sharing lives, in a community that pulses and shifts like the tide. \n\nIn this place, diversity is the law, as unyielding as gravity. Faces from all corners of the earth find themselves here, drawn to this place of learning. The staff find refuge in houses, the young ones in dormitories, and the elder students, wiser perhaps, in the apartments. \n\nThe people defy description, each a world unto themselves, and so let us speak instead of the stores and parks. This college, this self-contained universe, holds within it all manner of stores, from those that feed the body to those that clothe it, unique in their offerings yet familiar, the scent of academia upon them. \n\nAnd the park, a refuge amidst the stone and glass, is a gathering place for the diverse souls, a sanctuary kept safe by the hands of the community, clean and free from the shadows that plague the world beyond. \n\nIn this place, everything needed lies within reach, the boundaries of the neighborhood holding all things fast, as if in the embrace of a world entire.",
            "In the place where I live sidewalks are a rarity. All things seem to flow downward, cresting at the house at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill. Joggers test their mettle against its incline, running up the narrow road where the pavement bears the scars of time and weather. Pits and ruts that make for treacherous driving. The telephone and electric wires drape from pole to pole, tattered and forlorn. Storms rage in this country, and the wind and the rain bring down branches that strike at the lines. Repairs leave them a patchwork shamble. Tall evergreens rise everywhere about, though folks here despise them. They cut them down to clear the view of the ocean, building their homes high atop the hill with great glass walls to drink in the vista of the bay. At sunset, when the light beneath the waves ignites and the sky burns orange, it is a beauty that wounds the soul. Yet more often than not clouds hang low, and the sun's rays come filtered through a haze. Days are damp and overcast, and moss creeps over every surface it can claim: roofs and cars and railings alike. I left my car in the drive for a month and when I returned it was green and furred with moss, and it took hours to scrape it clean.  \n\nChildren are few in these parts, despite the school not far off. The neighbors are mostly older, retired, their lawns populated by dogs in place of offspring. The dogs roam free, racing down the street, and if a door or window is left ajar they may slip inside. I found one in the living room once, had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits run wild, too, and some grow large, digging up the roots of plants, burrowing into lawns, much to the gardeners' dismay. My cats hunt them with a vengeance, driving them from our vicinity. Birds flit about, sparrows and hummingbirds, with the hawks and eagles sometimes swooping low until the crows rise to chase them off.  \n\nThere's no store nearby, but if you head down the hill toward the waterfront, you'll find a handful of restaurants serving fresh catch. The beach is scant, more rock than sand, but the stones make for good throwing into the bay, which is not wide. Even through the mist you can see the far shore, a line across the water, constant and unyielding.",
            "In the sprawling cityscape of New York, there's a place called Bensonhurst. It's not hard to find, not with public transportation weaving through like sinews in a great beast. This urban enclave holds all the chaos and vibrancy of the city itself. Walk the streets and you'll meet the eyes of the Asian storefronts, a testament to the waves of souls who came seeking something on these shores. Two decades of change have painted the neighborhood in new colors, the lines of its face altered yet familiar.\n\nThe markets and laundromats—they stand sentinel on each block, their doors open to the world. The food is good, the prices fair, and convenience reigns supreme in this corner of the city. In a stretch no longer than a child's laughter, four supermarkets cater to the needs of the people. This is Bensonhurst, diverse in its bones and sinews, with generations of immigrants mingling among the streets. The businesses, large and small, ripple with the influence of their Asian proprietors, shaping the rhythm of daily life.\n\nThere's a park nearby, where the city's children run free. Ten basketball courts, fields wide enough for the dreams of soccer and baseball, handball walls to echo the slap of a ball. Swings and a playground offer respite, and in the heat of summer, a fountain becomes a haven. Here, the fabric of humanity is as varied as the city itself, each stitch a different hue.\n\nBuildings rise here and there, co-ops and condos, but mostly it's the houses, two families to a plot, that hold the stories of the people. The air is alive with sound, music blaring from cars, engines roaring in the dawn. It's a noisy place, but the noise is life. Yet, when night falls, you must tread carefully. The streets can turn on you, and in their shadows lurk the unpredictable. Memories of assaults long past and packages pilfered from doorsteps linger like ghosts.\n\nThe city's rules are a whisper against the wind. Fines for unheeded norms, for the mess left by dogs on their morning rounds. You walk, eyes cast downward, wary of where you place your feet. It's the smallest things that can unsettle you, the little grievances that gnaw at the edges of your peace. In Bensonhurst, as in all places, you find the good and the less so, side by side, as the city goes on, ever living, ever changing.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, there's a thread you must grasp to understand its soul, and that thread is called \"weird.\" Painted bold on the backside of a building—a place that wears many masks as a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, and skirts the edges of the law—is the town's unofficial creed: \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, it echoes a lament for the Portland of yesteryears, the nineties and early two-thousands, a city less known, less burdened by cost, a crucible of creativity and subcultures. For others, it's a siren call—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is not a slur but a badge of honor. Even as the city swells with newcomers from California, the skyline crammed with condominiums to house them, Portland remains steadfastly weird. Yet, weird does not always embrace; it simply lets things be that which they usually are not. It does not mean we shun modernity or the battles it brings. Like the rest of the land, we import our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to flout the norm, yet Portland is no stranger to the mundane. It's a city of yoga and hipsters and suited professionals. Perhaps to be weird here is to carry it all with a lighter heart. My neighborhood, like many, is a tapestry of painted houses and gardens that spill over with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, where free boxes sprout like wildflowers in the summer. These boxes, humble cardboard or plastic, offer up their contents to the wanderer—a gift, a treasure meant for the one who finds it. They hold clothes and books, sometimes more, sometimes less, but always a promise of serendipity. This is the magic of walking through a Southeast Portland street—that is, what it means to me, though I am but one shade in a spectrum of weird. Among us, some would never stoop to pick their clothes from a sidewalk box. They seek their strangeness in goat yoga or the roaring stands of Timbers matches. Portland is a haven for those who love their passions fiercely, whether they chase dreams or find them at the bottom of a glass in a dim-lit bar. Yes, we have our demons. Drugs seep through the city like rain through the gutters, their root often in the mind's shadows, fed by the endless rain and the gray sky's weight. Homelessness is a specter that haunts us, a puzzle with no easy answer. Our city's hands stretch out with services, better than most, yet never enough, like elsewhere. Between care and disdain, we sway, and in this we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stood eternal in their northern fastness, bearing witness to the sun's rites at every dawn and dusk, indifferent to the stirrings of man or the petty tides of his days. They watched, unblinking, as I moved through the world below, their presence a constant, immutable truth. In times of turmoil, when life pressed upon me with its myriad demands, they summoned my gaze, demanding to be seen, offering a moment's respite to my restless soul. It was here I came as a young scholar, drawn to the university nestled in their shadow. The mountains claimed me first, their majesty eclipsing the allure of the stately buildings and tranquil ponds of the campus. The town, too, held its charms, a tapestry of quaint cafés where many a night was spent in caffeine-induced study. A short journey brought one to the heart of the town, where the faded bricks of old buildings whispered of a history rich and enduring. Here, the town pulsed with the vigor of life, a brief mimicry of the bustling city nearby, yet all too soon it yielded back to the quietude of its suburban soul. This dance of contrasts, the city's restless energy and the town's serene quietude, invited exploration and the weaving of memories. There were nights spent wandering, laughter echoing past rusty swings, or racing through the vibrant streets to catch a show, the tickets a gift from the university. Yet, the town also bore witness to life's harsher truths, as all places must. The ponds, especially, became a refuge for reflection or the silent tears of existential doubt in the small hours. I found myself pondering my place in the great tapestry of life, watching the turtles and ducks and insects, each playing their part. And so I walked, past the pond and park and the rows of houses steeped in suburban quiet, until I reached the main street. The sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, the sky a canvas of blue and yellow, and I realized my steps had led me northward. There they were, the mountains, steadfast and towering, grazing the sky with their ancient forms. In their silent strength, they stirred within me a will to endure.",
            "In the dim shade of a sun-baked afternoon, you might pass it by without a second thought. Just a residential area, lurking behind a tattered shopping strip, not the sort of place one would reckon folks lay their heads. Surely not the sort of place most would choose. Yet, if your feet lead you past the derelict husk of the old Whole Foods and beyond the weary hotels standing empty but for those scattered summer gatherings, you'll stumble upon a hidden hive of life. Streets lined with apartment blocks, standing shoulder to shoulder, like Russian dolls meticulously disassembled and placed out in a solemn procession along the road. The first of these buildings, infamous from the news, speak of dealings best left unspoken. Appearances, they are deceptive things. Yet, in the shadow of these, the remaining complexes hold a world unknown to those who wander these parts. Across from them, the community college's satellite campus sits, a cluster of sleepy edifices, guarding the road. Students drift in with coffee clutched close, eyes heavy with the dawn, starting their days in a drowsy haze. The iron gates creak and groan, letting them in, one by one, as the commuters curse and gnash their teeth, the traffic swells and ebbs with the morning tide.  \n\nThe road ends at a crossroads, where a park sprawls on one side and a rehabilitation center, a haven for those with bones fractured by fate, stands on the other. Its porch hosts cheerful furniture, and the ceiling fan turns slow, stirring the thick summer air like a gentle hand through water. Children dart and dance across the park's grassy expanse, limbs flailing joyously among the bees that buzz 'round the flowers. Retirees walk dogs along the path, eyes narrowed at the skateboarders, nodding politely at the teenage girls, who whisper of boys and the latest YouTube idols. Nearby, a sushi joint sits in the strip mall’s embrace, serving modest fare to sparse crowds. A swimming supply store clings close beside, a nail salon nestled between. One could ready a pool, manicure nails, and feast on hibachi chicken all in one breath—the strange allure of the strip mall. A frozen yogurt place too, where teens from the park clutch chilled cups, adorned with toppings, as they skate and vape, chasing the ghost of cool. This neighborhood, a slice of Americana, a relic of the languid South where time drifts slow, like the smoke from a distant fire.",
            "The neighborhood's a place of quiet mystery, a tapestry of single-family homes interwoven with those split in twain yet bound together, a strange harmony that makes a kind of sense. Our house stands with its small yard in the fore and a narrow drive to the left, a relic of a time when the suburbs promised the American dream, that once-sweet embrace now turned away, leaving us to grasp what remains. Yet the neighborhood endures, calling out in its mute way that the dream lives still, clung to by those who wander its streets. The folk here, they've lost some of the shine in their eyes, their yards untended as once they weren't, but cars still grace the drives, and children run and shout, their games the whole of their world.\n\nThe old public school, nearing a century, stands firm, conjuring futures for the young and stirring memories in the old. Churches, sparse and echoing, stand mostly empty, but the basketball courts still resound with life. Each home bears its own face yet they echo one another, a chorus of sameness. Super \"A,\" the supermarket, is held by a Yemeni family, the sole Arabs in this place where most folk are African American. Wide streets stretch out, fields for children playing football, pausing only for passing cars.\n\nGenerations have walked these streets, tales of a time when all knew each other spoken in the quiet of porches. There was a karate school once, but as Hollywood's tales of the Karate Kid faded, so did the children's dreams, and now it's a pharmacy, for such are the times. A small theater shows old films, shunned by the young for lack of new spectacle, but cherished by elders, a bargain for a night away from the clamor.\n\nAn expressway cuts through, its exits lying beyond our reach, the youth having clamored for their own gateway, a notion the elders quashed, fearing it would mar what we have. Now a new high school rises, and in it, a choice for a mascot. I think of a cyborg with a country twang, a cabin of logs, a fitting emblem for this place of ours.",
            "In the sprawl of this city, the neighborhood winds through a tapestry of lives and places, each thread distinct yet woven into the whole. The city breathes with the cadence of its diversity, blocks lined with dwellings that stand amidst the scatter of businesses, each pursuing its own commerce under the vast indifferent sky. Here, in this labyrinth of streets, restaurants rise like sentinels offering their fare, while shops both grand and humble beckon all who wander by. The boutiques, with their small windows and whispered promises, nestle beside the giants of corporate commerce, their shadows stretching across pavements that lead to parks where parents watch their children at play, laughter echoing in the open air.\n\nThe people of this place are as varied as the city itself. Each face tells a story, and they gather in communities, each with its own pulse. Here, a vibrant LGBTQ+ community flourishes beside the solemnity of Orthodox Jewish life, and nearby, the echoes of the former Soviet Union linger in the voices of refugees and immigrants. Beyond these borders, the city stretches wide, where each district bears the stamp of those who call it home—Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—all within a stone's throw yet separated by the slow crawl of traffic that chokes the city's arteries.\n\nFew choose to walk the endless streets, for the city sprawls far and wide, and the vehicles claim the roads with their ceaseless noise. Construction cranes swing their long arms, raising new towers into the skyline, drawing more souls to this crowded land. The residents watch, some with hope, others with wary eyes, for the roads groan beneath the weight of so many, and the hunt for a place to rest one's car is a trial unto itself.\n\nYet within this chaos lies choice. There are houses and homes, spread across the city in their multitude of forms. Large apartments rise like cliffs, but for those who seek the quiet, there are smaller buildings, single-family homes, and duplexes that hold their ground against the encroaching tide. Here too, the people differ, each age and story a part of the city's fabric. But the bonds that once tied neighbor to neighbor have weakened, and the streets remember a time when children's laughter filled the air, when the games of youth bound them together in camaraderie beneath the watchful gaze of long-vanished summers.",
            "Where's everything? she said as we rolled through the endless cornfields, the horizon swallowed whole by the stalks. This is it, I told her, knowing the vastness would leave her stunned. She came from a place where the grocery store lay but a five-minute stroll away—never had she seen such open sky. Awash in the sameness of corn, I spoke of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew me and the soil from which I came. The road stretched on, a narrow country lane, till it met a quarry filled with water, and just beyond, the small settlement that was home. These houses, brick and stucco, each resting on their half-acre plots, land that folks here took pride in tending. Come spring, flowers burst forth, and trees of the Midwest donned their seasonal dress. Driveways lined with gleaming Mercedes, their chrome bright under the noonday sun after a careful wash.\n\nOnward we drove toward my gray stucco home, past my Korean neighbor with his ever-present smile. He spent his days on the mower, his song rising above its drone, a man whose humor had softened with age. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and the hum of his John Deere. The neighborhood chuckled at his antics, but he was genuine, a soul with stories to tell. At last, my home. In the side yard, geese wandered, pursued by our Terrier. Out back, a stream fed the quarry, its voice mingling with the bullfrog's call and the distant lowing of cattle.\n\nAcross the bridge I built by hand lay an untouched oasis, wild with trees and herbs and flowers never planted. Here was the ground of my childhood, building forts in the trees, chasing creatures more imagined than real. Always something to do, a neighbor child to join in play. Winters came hard in our small town, the kind that cut to the bone, but they brought a beauty all their own. The land, once green, turned stark and bare, the trees mere skeletons against the sky. Snow fell sometimes, and overnight the world transformed, a winter's dream. The backyard filled with snow angels, my sister's hand in their making, and snowmen stood sentry. We fought often as children, my sister and I, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen arms. Our forts were grand, igloos built of branches, housing our arsenal. In that frozen world, we played at life, nothing beyond our make-believe mattered. We were children, unburdened by the weight of the world."

            "I live in Rural America, specifically small town Michigan. Where you go from farmland to small tourist cities. There is no big city malls, no Wal-mart, Target, or even an Applebee’s. Anywhere you need to go, you have to drive to get to. Despite that I live in one of the most beautiful places in the world surrounded by water. My “city” is surrounded by water. Beautiful Lake Michigan to one side, and Lake Charlevoix on the other. Everywhere you go you can find a beach to dip your toes in. My neighborhood, reflects the idea of small town. Houses are not stacked upon one another. They aren’t cookie cutter houses that are built the same. They are older homes, some of them being updated and remodeled some of them being older. Most homes have basements. Full Basements that you can see from the road. Many houses in the neighborhood have older aluminum siding. We have houses every color you can imagine in the blocks that surround my house. Most of the houses have yards. Yards with trampolines, and playsets. Some people have gardens, and fences for their animals. The houses resemble Middle America. Hard working people who work to make a living and are either raising families or have raised families. On any given day you will see kids running up and down the streets. You will also see people walking dogs, biking and rollerblading. Neighbors know neighbors and you can recognize who fits in and who doesn’t belong. You will see someone grilling outside and wave, or even someone that is walking their dog from a few blocks down and smile pleasantly. The lawns are kept in decent condition. Nobody has leaves piled up from fall time. Green grass is kept mowed and under control. If people have plants and bushes in their yards they are kept trimmed down. It isn’t a beautiful neighborhood that you drive into and think wow look at the nice homes, but one you drive into and think you can tell this would be a good place to raise a family. It’s quiet, peaceful and, and safe. While only average looking, it is exceptional for the fact that it represents what people want in the world, which is a safe place to land at the end of the day. Within walking distance there is the county sheriff’s department and jail. The Health department is just next to that. The city recycling center sits just down the road, and neighbors and residents from around the city utilize the services they provide. We have baseball and softball fields nearby where you can hear the announcers keeping score and calling the names of players. Our small town airport is next to that. You can be playing outside, or even inside and hear the rumbles of small engine planes taking off and landing. You can walk to get ice cream from the local ice cream place, and if you are really into it you can make it downtown from our neighborhood of homes. My kids can ride their bikes to the park which is only 8 blocks or so away. It is a really great place to live.\n",
            "The general area in which I live in can be described as your typical cookie cutter suburbia. For my neighborhood in particular, the presence of a homeowner's association is very apparent. Upon entering, you'll see nothing but well-maintained single family homes, which we can thank the homeowner's association for. The front yards are all very similar. There's a small patch of landscaped grass, some decorative pebbles, and rather short driveways. Every so often you'll see small trees as well. Everyone has a two car garage. As you continue to drive along throughout the neighborhood you'll see newly paved concrete. Despite many different families living here, the roads are in excellent condition. You won't find any potholes or anything like that here. Most of the houses are single story, but sometimes you'll see two stories as well. We don't have a typical mailbox set-up that you would expect for single family homes. There are no individual mailboxes in front of each house. Instead, it's more like apartments where there are a large grouping of mailboxes at the end of the street. Everyone uses a key to gain access their specific mailbox. And there's two larger lockers for packages. Again, you can thank the HOA and their obsession with uniformity for this. The location of my house is on the extreme edge of the nearby city, so my neighborhood can be described as part rural, part suburbs. As a result, we have a lot of land for, well, everything. There's multiple community pools to which anyone living here can access. It's well maintained and gated. And then there are various walking trails where you can walk your dog, or just go for an evening stroll by yourself. You don't have to visit a park to get your exercise in. The neighborhood is large enough that you can simply run around it and get more than enough exercise. Most of the community is made up of retired people. It's a very safe area, and everyone looks out for one another. Mixed in with that, we have a small amount of middle aged and young professionals too. In regards to the city, it's surprisingly large - at least by population - but also has a small time town feel. We have the vast majority of amenities that you come to expect and rely on. For example, we have a exactly one mall. It's not huge, but it gets the job done. For me, it takes around 15 minutes of driving to get anywhere significant, but once I do that, I am greeted with many different stores to choose from. We have everything from high end grocery stores where you can get organic food, to bargain outlets that only stock a small selection of items and has bare minimum staff to keep costs down. All in all, my neighborhood is safe, well-maintained, and pretty typical. We have a lot of nice things, like pools and walking trails. And although we aren't right next door to any sort of shopping, you can just hop in a car and go to any major chain that you'd like.\n",
            "The first time I'd heard of my place, I was listening to a podcast about people who'd gone missing. It was a little surprising. Almost every apartment in the area was going for over a thousand dollars a month. I'd never heard anything about that story and neither had any of my friends. Maybe it's the struggle. I know a few of my friends cry themselves to sleep at night. Things are expensive, but we've learned how to be frugal over the years. You start to like the dusty smell of flea market toys and mothballed clothes. You smell a lot less in adulthood. You might start to smoke, or you might just be too accustomed to the state of things. But the flea market always asserts itself. The smell of adulthood is dusty magazines stacked on a closed piano. It wedges itself in the leather and stays in even after you wash it. Here, there're 3 thrift stores in walking distance. If you start on the far side, you can patronize two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is dense, cars and people fill the streets every morning, but you'd never hear it in the thrifts. No matter how many people or cars pass by, the store is silent. It's a nice place to lose an afternoon. Every year, there's more and more of those. Cars and people flood it. It's a developing city, they say. Headquartering one of the largest online empires for e-commerce and delivery, it's still showing growing pains. It reminds me of New York. Everything and everyone is set on their own goals, and there isn't a whole lot anyone asks from you. You can be alone, quiet, and independent, and people will leave you alone. It's not like the South, where being a little concerned means you care. You don't pry into anyone's life here, really. You can keep up your shell as long as you'd like, and the city will crash and roll back like waves on the beach. It's a lively place to be. Between the pianist next door and the two amateur vocalists upstairs, there's always something going on. In a way, we have less of an apartment of strangers and more a community of friends. We come together for our needs, celebrate birthdays, mourn funerals, and help each other when we can. In a way, I'm lucky to be here. I quite like most of my neighbors and they treat me pretty well. I try to make sure to clean after myself and leave them food and they do the same in kind. I bring mail to them and they to me. It's nice to see them and I believe they enjoy my presence as much as I do theirs. I live in a massive, dehumanizing modernist sprawl but it's people like my neighbors that make me feel like I didn't totally ruin my life.\n",
            "I live in a small Midwestern town that is just outside the suburban areas of a major city. My immediate neighborhood, on the east side of the town, could be described as the most economically disadvantaged area of the town. Property values are low, with most houses being rented to or owned by low-income individuals. However, it is not unattractive or unpleasant. My neighbors are generally friendly people who will smile and say hello when I walk down the street. Crime rates, while slightly higher than other parts of town, are still generally low. There have been a few violent crimes in the past ten years within a few blocks of my home, including a few shootings and at least one homicide. Our next door neighbors lost their son in a shooting outside an area bar last year. Fortunately, our family has not been directly affected by crime other than having an occasional item disappear from our porch if we forget to bring it inside. In general, the town in which I live has been profoundly affected by the “opioid epidemic” that has affected many parts of the United States. Many lives have been lost due to fentanyl overdoses. Fortunately, there are many resources in my town to combat this epidemic, including several addiction rehabilitation centers and Narcan training sessions for families and friends of those affected by addiction. Despite these challenges, this town has many positive attributes. My son’s elementary school has excellent staff, from the principal to the teachers and support staff. Despite having special needs, he has not faced any bullying thus far due to the incredibly positive atmosphere of the school, and he loves it there. We have an active PTO that plans multiple events throughout the year to promote family involvement and educational progress. Because over 20% of our town’s population lives below the poverty level, the elementary school provides free breakfast and lunch to all students, so that no child ever has to go hungry. No child or family is treated as “less than” due to an inability to pay, and costs for school fees, supplies, and field trips are very reasonable. The City Council and staff have made many improvements to the appearance of our town, including repaving roads, landscaping, and refurbishing city parks. Unfortunately, most of these improvements have taken place in the center of town and on the west side, where all of the shopping areas are located and most of the traffic passes through. The east side where I live tends to be neglected, which is a point of contention for those in my neighborhood. Overall, I do enjoy living in this town. People are generally friendly, the schools are great, there are enough shopping options (both small businesses and larger retail stores) to meet my family’s needs, and our home may not be worth much, but it is comfortable and adequate. Our family has lived here for over 16 years, and we cannot imagine living anywhere else.\n",
            "My neighborhood is full of culture. It's set upon a hill, surrounded by buildings with historical meaning. I live in a 7 story apartment building right across from the old live Theater, and a block down The Hill, is this cool little arcade bar that different types of people flock to on warm summer nights. Often times, especially on the weekends in June and July, you will see a line of people waiting to get in. A few blocks up is the nearest city park. It's pretty big considering the part of town it sits in. Encircling the park is concrete, with tall stairs poured into the wall. During the frigid winter months, homeless people set their tents up in neat little rows along the sidewalk and along the wide steps. It doesn't snow much, but it rains, and the torrential down pour in the mid-winter months often tends to make it difficult to keep warm. Setting their tents up close together, in the center of town rather than out in the jungle, keeps them much warmer. They're also within reasonable walking and transit distance to the only family center for miles, where they can bathe and shower. What I love about my city though, isn't the beauty of the historic nature- the tall proud buildings, the architecture that is spattered through-out the varying levels of the hills that roll down towards the ocean. What I love about my neighborhood is the culture of the people themselves. You see, Hilltop once was the most notorious neighborhood on the West Coast for gang violence. You still hear stories, even three decades later, about the federal government officials and the DEA sweeping through like a broom, trying to clean the streets. The people, they don't forget. Stories are still passed from generation to generation, on through to transplants like me, of those days. The people work hard, even though it's still considered one of the rougher 'hoods' in the entire city, to keep it cleaned up. They still care about what goes on in their city, on their block. They say that if you're white, you shouldn't walk around the Hill after dark. Truly, I believe that this warning is reminiscent of the old days, and it is tinged with the sour taste of social conditioning. Perhaps it is that I am just dark enough to pass for a not entirely \"white-girl,\" or maybe Hilltop recognizes me as one of their own, someone who is just as painfully aware of the reminders that constantly plague our nation. Reminders that racism, cultural conditioning, and assumptions are made out of ignorance and fear, even in a city that is supposed to be a cultural melting pot Utopia. I know one thing: no matter how far I roam, the Hilltop is home. I feel alive walking those streets at night, meeting people who have more quickly and rarely nefariously offered me a jacket than to rob me. It's a place where laundromat owners have stayed open just a few minutes later so I could charge my phone when I had no where to escape from the rain. It's a place where I have sat, believe myself to be invisible, huddled against concrete store fronts on the most grey dreary of nights, only to have someone stop and look me in the eye, hand me a $5, and tell me I'm beautiful and valuable.\n",
            "I moved to this neighborhood just when I was about to start eighth grade. It was hard for me to make friends at first, but I ended up getting close to someone who lives two houses down from me and another guy that lives on my street. Neither of them lives there anymore but the memories are still there. The same people who lived here when I first moved here are still here for the most part. My neighborhood is pretty similar to your average American suburban neighborhood. The neighborhood has a lot of two-story houses in it. Every weekend or just whenever it is warm outside I hear the kids playing outside. The neighborhood is quiet most days of the week. I have never had a problem with any of the people in the neighborhood. You are left alone in this neighborhood unless you need help. I have ordered multiple packages online and have never gotten a package snatched off of my porch. I feel like I can trust my neighbors. There is a park a minute or two away from my house. I have a lot of memories there. I have played basketball, football, and baseball there with the other guys in the neighborhood before. I also ended up with one of my worst memories there when I got elbowed in the nose playing football, but the good memories outweigh the bad. Nowadays, whenever I go to that park it is to spend time with my cousin's kids. They are much younger than me and still like playing on swings and slides and all of that type of stuff. Just the thought of going to the park makes them excited. The park makes me very nostalgic for a number of different reasons now. The neighborhood is very diverse. You will find all kinds of food nearby. In just a one mile radius, you would be able to find Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian restaurants. However, nowadays, a lot of people just use apps just as GrubHub and DoorDash to get their food delivered to them. The most popular food places are the fast food shops but you can get those near pretty much any suburban neighborhood. There are also plenty of pizza places. The stores here contain everything you would ever need. There are multiple dry cleaners nearby. There is a Walgreens and a CVS on the same street as well as a Jewel-Osco grocery store, which is popular in the Midwest. Some of the stores are even diverse as there is an Indian-owned store if you are ever in the mood to make some homemade Indian food or to buy some ready-made Indian food. Overall, I am a fan of my neighborhood. Reading on social media and seeing on the news some of the horror stories other people have to go through with their neighbors makes me grateful for mine.\n",
            "My neighborhood is nearby to the college that I attend, and for that I quite enjoy living there. There are mostly apartment buildings, but a few restaurants and bars that are fun to go to and aren't terribly expensive to go to. One of the bars was just renamed, and that one is more expensive to go to but it isn't really the worst quality of service or drinks there. Most of the people are nice. They are either college kids or they are lower income, since the apartment housing isn't very expensive. There's a lot of children nearby since there is an elementary school within walking distance of my apartment. I don’t know my neighbors, but I don’t really want to. They smoke a lot of weed and so the management of my building put an air freshener unit right across from their door, which my boyfriend and I found very funny. It’s almost insulting. The buildings that are around me are usually pretty old looking but might have renovated interiors. Down the street a bit there are brand new apartments, but I don’t like them because I know the construction done on them wasn’t particularly good. They’re cheaply built but the rent is expensive, which I think is such a scam but because they’re near campus, the management of those buildings can get away with it. There is a really cheap restaurant about five minutes from where I live that serves food only on paper plates and most of what they make is microwaved. Then across from that is a gas station, which I’ve heard isn’t a very good place to work. But thanks to some money from the city, the road was redone last summer so that there’s a nice big sidewalk, lots of grass on the medians and sides of the roads, and now the area is a little nicer. But the apartment building I live in is shrouded in tress. They cut a few of them down, so there are a few stumps, but there are a lot more trees where I live than down the road. Behind my apartment complex is a tree line and then another set of apartments. I live on 42nd street, but right behind is 43rd street and that one isn’t as nice. The sidewalks are really bad and falling apart, and most of the buildings on it look shabby. There are a lot of trees on this street, but that is probably to hide what the buildings look like. Most of the crime in my area has happened at an apartment complex on that street, but then again, I can’t blame just them. There are apartments across the street from me that also have a lot of crime and a rather transient population. But I think I like where I live. I can afford it, and there’s plenty of useful amenities nearby. I especially like how the university is within walking distance and there are two bus stops so that I can get to the store and downtown with ease.\n",
            "My neighborhood is made up of duplex's on a cul-de-sac. They are intermittently placed and spaced so that they look like individual houses. The only difference is each is painted yellow with white porches and green metal roofs. Almost everyone, but not all, are friends with each other. We stand at the end of a not pre-decided driveway some evenings and chit chat while the small children of the neighborhood play with their toys, sidewalk chalk or fly their kites. It is very refreshing in this modern all to mechanical/computer filled world. It is rather like stepping back in time. We are surrounded by fields and trees enhanced by blue skies and white billowing clouds. The only downfall? This season, we are experiencing tornado warnings and for the first time, last night we actually heard actual tornado sirens so we had to head towards shelter. Sure enough, you would have found me in my bathtub clutching my littlest dog along with my purse and a few pillows. My big dog wanted nothing to do with the bathroom and remained in the livingroom, nervous and barking, nervous about the odd circumstances. The neighborhood was quiet except for the sound of large hail which fell all bout the ground. After the storm the road literally was steaming from the change of temperature. We went from 92 to 75 in a matter of minutes. The hail immediately melted when it hit the hot pavement. As I looked up towards the clearing skies, the sun came out and it started to rain. A double rainbow apparated. I ran into the house and grabbed my camera. Quickly snapped pictures to share with my Facebook friends and family. They were in awe, as was I. The streets remained quiet for another hour, before some people finally came home from wherever they were when the thunderstorm hit. Then it was business as usual, mom’s and children outside as dinner cooked. Such a friendly neighborhood for this gal who has recently moved form NH to NC. I adore the southern accent that people speak with. I have a two bedroom and two bath apartment, as does everyone. Though all the houses look the same on the outside, not all of the apartments are the same on the inside. Some are actually quite tiny. It doesn’t make sense to me. I love to walk along the biggest field behind where I live and mosey down to the pond that is not made for swimming. I have seen deer and in the morning you can hear the giant bullfrog singing his song. It is a fantastic place to live just forty minutes outside the city of Charlotte. Each morning is welcomed by the sound of roosters crowing from the surrounding farms. It is rather like living in a small community village of it’s own. We even have a donkey at a nearby farm that you can hear braying in the evening to let us know he is there. I was lucky to find this gem of a neighborhood.\n",
            "Well, considering that I’ve been here for about 10 years, I guess I can share what I know. First off, I was pretty sad when I first came to my neighborhood. I came from Riverdale to Stockbridge, and I’m not going to lie, I cried, because I missed them and I loved them.. but my mom and dad wanted the best for me and my little sister, so we moved to a better location for housing, a better high school, everything was considered “not ghetto” when we moved to our new neighborhood. Throughout the years, I got used to it, and made some new friends, and some new enemies too in school. I never really truly got to know my neighbors throughout the years, except Mr. Glen and his children, as well as Dennis for a bit, both being right next to us. They have been enjoyable people that I almost can consider as family in some ways, and I truly do appreciate them. I remember when me, mom, dad, and my sister went to Mr. Glen’s wedding (They got re-married) It was really fun and enjoyable to say the least, and something I’m looking forward to someday, as I build my wealth and give my future wife the life of a Queen. When Mr. Glen’s wife, Ms. Veda, took off the white little strap on her leg and threw it, I caught it! Sadly I didn’t catch the flowers! We all danced the night away, and I really enjoyed having a good time with Marsharii, one of their daughters. I haven’t seen her since though. I hope she’s moved on to bigger and better things. The neighborhood itself is like a maze, although now I have a GPS, so I can take more time to explore it. I’ve only went so far, and that is when I’ve hung out with my friends Kason and Curtis. We all used to play video games alot, and just enjoy life to the fullest as much as we could. Sometimes I would go to the park and enjoy nature, which soothes my soul. It gives me a sense of calmness and peace these days. I’ll also bring some sticks that I bought from home depot and just practice my balance, And bring my bokken wooden sword if I can,. I have fun enjoying what I love to do. There’s also a basketball and tennis court, although I haven’t played tennis or basketball in a long time, It’s still nice to have in case I ever want to pick it back up and give it another go. My dad grew me and my best friend up on Tennis with Mr. Graves, and we’d always have a great time.. They worked us hard! But we always had fun. I guess there’s a lot of times I’ve had fun in this neighborhood, and there’s plenty of stories, but these are what really stuck out to me, and I believe that the best, is yet to come!\n",
            "My neighborhood is a quaint little town. It doesn't stand out from any other in South Carolina, but it's got a significant impact on the agriculture sector. Johnston is known as the Peach Capital of the World, something that the town proudly boasts about on the welcoming sign. It's primarily composed of farmland dominated by either peach trees or cattle. Houses that aren't located within the main part of town are widely spaced apart; most are two stories with either metal roofs to help combat the blazing summer heat or gray shingles. More often than not these houses aren't located near the road, but are further back allowing for the front fields to be used for animals/crops. Within the main part of town, there's a single stop light that hangs at a four way. Here is where the only stores in the entire town are located. There are three places in which you can get \"fast food': Hong Kong, a small Chinese restaurant run by a single family, Fiesta Mexican Restaurant, or Gary's, a small burger chain. There used to be a pizzeria, however it closed down a short time ago. There is a very small family-owned pharmacy called Maxwell and Halford Drug; funnily enough, they're best known for the Cherry Coca-Cola they sell. There is a small, but expensive grocery store called Independent Grocers Alliance, more commonly known as IGA. While it is the only grocery store in the entire town, many individuals only stop to pick up one or two items; most prefer to travel to a Walmart in Batesburg-Leesville in order to purchase the majority of their groceries. The most popular store in the entire town is Dollar General; this store sells a vast array of everyday items and it often busy from the moment it opens until closing time! There is a very small furniture store, Possibilities Furniture & More, run by a kind woman who is well-known within the community. The store has been in Johnston for a plethora of years and even employs two movers who will deliver the purchased furniture! Attached to the furniture store building is a small pet groomers called Clark's Cuts and Kennels. They provide a multitude of services such as daycare, boarding, grooming, nail grinding, bathing, etc. Both a doctor's and veterinary practice are situated away from the primary part of town; they are both very small practices, though well-equipped to aid the residents of Johnston. There is a single elementary school called Johnston Elementary School. Once students have completed fifth grade, they must attend both middle and high school in the next town over. There are technically no parks within the town, however they are currently in the midst of creating a 2.5 acre recreational area in order to provide families with more opportunities to enjoy outings and attract more visitors/potential residents. Admittedly there isn't much to do; there are no movie theaters, bowling alleys, \"hang out\" spots, playgrounds for children, areas to walk pets, or a large variety of restaurants. Despite this it's a nice town, so small that you could pass in the blink of an eye without realizing!\n",
            "I live in a typical suburb area in a small southern town in Tennessee. It's a connecting street between two state highways, so we get a bit more traffic on the street than I'd like, but other than that, it's a quiet neighborhood. There's not too many folks that move in and out, so I've grown used to most of the people that live in the neighborhood. People busy themselves with yard work and other daily chores for the most part. In the winter, we sled down a hill on our side street. We live in a house at the front corner of our street, so we see everyone coming and going all day long and are familiar with the cars that people drive around here. Whenever we see a strange vehicle, we tend to take note of it. Some of the neighbors go walking for exercise or just to walk their dogs. Kids play on their bikes and all that you would expect from that. We are at home a lot since we work from our house. There are four of us, Myself and my Wife, and two Daughters ages eleven and fourteen. So, I'd say that everyone else is used to us coming and going as well. We get outside and play, sometimes even in the rain. Once in a while we grill outside on our back deck and it's always a pleasant smell from the barbecue and all. It seems that there's always someone cutting grass around here and you can hear a lawn mower nearly every day from March through about October, when the grass finally stops growing. We have a lot of trees in our neighborhood as it was originally a wooded area, so there's lots of shade, but there's always a lot of leaves in the Fall as well. So, that means raking and burning the leaves on a yearly basis. I like the smell of burning leaves too, so that's always a nice sign that Fall has arrived. Lately, we've not been having much Winter to speak of, so it just feels like a long Fall. Our garage is at the back of our house, so we seldom use the front door of our house unless someone knocks on the door, which is rare. I like to work in the garage on my truck or other projects from time to time and when I have the garage doors open, it feels like I'm more tuned into the neighborhood. On holidays it is pretty quiet around here. Thanksgiving sees some of the neighborhood families visiting with people from out of town and there are extra cars parked everywhere during that time of year. It's the same at other holidays like Mother's day and Christmas. All in all, I like living here. If it weren't a through street, it would be perfect.\n",
            "My neighborhood is in the smack middle of the high desert, where there is dirt, dirt and more dirt. Unless someone has actually experienced living here, they probably donâ€™t really understand the feeling of always seeing brown , and when you do see a lawn, you know that person is spending a fortune on lawn care. When I first lived here in the 90s, houses were spread out far and wide. Now it is pretty much the same way by there are a lot of new additions. Honestly this place looks more and more like a city everyday, but supposed most places are changing the same way. Most of the time the people are very friendly, but just like any city you have your good parts and bad. In my neighborhood I'm surrounded by friendly old people iI guess it's a nicer neighborhood. The stores in this place are pretty much the store who have chains, like food for less and smart and final. If you want uscale you have to travel I never really see any whole foods or stores of that nature. The jobs that are most prominent in my city I would say not based on any official demographics, is construction. I think this is on account of this city is still not very developed, there is still a lot of wide open spaces to build. That kind of scares me, I like things the way they are now. I left a big city and I'm not keen on going back. Speaking of construction this was the field my full time job is located in, i am a drywall and T-bar instalator. What I like about my home is the different animals. People come to the high desert for many reasons, not the least of which is the stark beauty of the desert itself. High desert climate and topography have created challenging ecosystems which need protecting and which are home to different types of wildlife. Human residents of the high desert should take the time to learn about the non-human residents who share this environment in order to co-exist safely and harmoniously. My family and I have adapted very well to the wildlife. I have three children and they are all obsessed with lizards and dessert bugs, as I am writing this now they are outside trying to catch different specimens. As far as attractions goes we have some. Additionally, Victorville is a good place for families to experience the desert. It can generate a different experience. If you can, plan your visit to coincide with its annual event: the San Bernardino County Fair. The fair will enrich your visit with the right mix of activities and fun the Victorville way. Pop by the nearby Wrightwood to see the snow covered mountains and take some winter sports lessons to finish out your visit. Interested in the natural history and culture of the high desert ecosystem? The Victor Valley Museum includes geological and paleontological specimens, Native American artifacts, and historical objects that tell the story of the development of society and industry of Victorville.\n",
            "When asked to describe my neighborhood, I'm sure that my answer is somewhat unique. While others who respond to this are most likely homeowners with their own individual lives, my situation is a tad bit different. I consider my neighborhood to be the college campus that I stay on, and the people that live in my dormitory to be my community. I also consider the surrounding campus to be my neighborhood, albeit to a lesser extent. Despite this peculiarity, my neighborhood shares some commonalities with the more conventional ideas about a neighborhood. Just like any conventional neighborhood, the neighborhood I stay in has houses, people, stores and parks. Let us begin by discussing the \"houses\" that comprise my neighborhood. Before I begin to explore the houses in my neighborhood, it would be best to clarify the types of house that can be found in my neighborhood. There are three types of housing in my immediate vicinity, the apartments, the actual houses, and the dormitory houses. First, In the apartments, there are usually between 2-4 people in any given room, and there are about 4-6 rooms on each floor. The most common building type can house about 2 floors, so on average, there are 20 or so people living in each building. Second, are the actual houses that are available for anyone with an affiliation to the school to rent. Typically these are 2-4 bedroom setups that usually have alumni living in them. However, there are only a handful of these types of houses spread throughout the neighborhood, as they are less efficient. Finally, there are the typical dorm rooms which house 100's of students. In these, you have two people sharing a room with some exception, and it is the most common type of housing in my neighborhood. With housing covered we are ready to move on to the people. My school prides itself on diversity and this is reflected in the makeup of my neighborhood. There are people from all cultures and ages that live in my neighborhood. Most of the professional staff live in the houses that are placed in the neighborhood, whereas the newer students stay in the dormitory style housing and the older students stay in the apartment-style housing. The people in this neighborhood can't be done justice by simply talking about them, so it would be best to simply move on to the stores and parks in my neighborhood. Since my school really is it's own self-contained neighborhood, it has a plethora of stores and a single park. The stores are a mix of dining options that would be found in any other neighborhood, and the schools own unique brand of clothing and grocery stores. As such, anything that is needed can be found within my neighborhood's boundaries! Additionally, the park in my neighborhood is a playground for all the diverse people in my neighborhood, it is kept clean and free of crime by all the members of my neighborhood!\n",
            "There aren't many sidewalks where I live. Everything seems to flow downward, and my house sits right at the crest of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. People call it the \"work out hill\" because so many joggers like to run up it during their daily work out. As there aren't any sidewalks at all on my street everyone walks on the road. There road is pitted in a few places and can feel a bit hazardous to drive on. Some of the telephone and electric wires strung up around the block at tattered looking. It rains and storms a lot in our area, so branches and other debris often strike down the power lines and the constant repairs make them look checkered and patchwork-y. There's many tall evergreen trees all around everywhere you look. But people here hate the trees. They strive to cut down as many as possible because the trees obstruct the view of the ocean. That's why many of the houses are built so high up on the hill, with huge glass-fronted second stories that loom up one after the other to take in the view of the bay. It's gorgeous around sunset when the water seems to get lit up from below and the sky turns orange. It's cloudy more often than not, though, so you end up seeing most of the sunlight through a haze. Most days are overcast and damp. Moss grows on everything it can: roofs, cars, and railings. I once left my car parked out in my driveway for a month and when I went out to use it, it had turned green and furry with moss. Took me three hours to scrap it all off. There aren't that many children around where I live, though there's a school only a few blocks away. Most of the people in my neighborhood are older, many of them retired. Instead of kids, people have dogs. It's common to see them sitting out in people's lawns or racing down the street after each other. If you leave a door or window open you risk having them sneak into your house. I found one once in my living room and had to shoo it back out the front door. Rabbits run wild around the area. Some of them are good sized, and the gardeners hate them because the dig up the roots of plants and burrow into people's lawns. My cats love them though, and have hunted most of them out of our neighborhood. We also get the usual assortment of birds: small sparrows and hummingbirds, and the occasional hawk or eagle sometimes swoops by until the neighborhood crows chase it off. There aren't any stores around, but if you hike downhill to the waterfront there's a few restaurants that serve fresh seafood. There isn't much of a beach down there, but the rocks along the shore are fun to hurl into the water. The bay itself isn't very wide. You can see the opposite shoreline clearly even through the mist on most days.\n",
            "If you are planning on visiting Bensonhurt, Brooklyn, you will not have a difficult time finding it! Public transportation is very accessible and is one of the most popular forms of transportation in New York City. Bensonhurt is a fairly urban neighborhood, so you will still feel as if you are in New York City. During your visit, be prepared to see the various Asian stores all around. Over the past two decades, Bensonhurt has received an influx of Asian inhabitants. Because of this, you will see an Asian-owned store at least every block as you are walking. Most popular are supermarkets and laundromats. Coincidentally, these businesses are very popular among local residents, as quality of food in the supermarkets are superb, the prices are much cheaper, and finally yet importantly, it is very convenient. Just nearby where I am, there are four Asian supermarkets within two minutes of walking distance from each other. This just adds to the convenience of accessing grocery. I’m not saying Bensonhurst is purely populated by Asian inhabitants, though. It is quite diverse all around, with immigrants and their first-generation and second-generation American children here. Most of the large and popular businesses in the local area are Asian owned. In addition to these Asian owned businesses, there is also a recently renovated park nearby, which has around ten basketball courts, a large field for soccer or baseball, four handball courts, swings, a playground for kids, and even a water fountain for kids to enjoy water in the summer. Since we are in New York City, of course the parks are very diverse. You will see all sorts of diversity here, able to play and get along well. In this neighborhood, there aren’t many large corporate buildings. The only buildings you’d find are ones for co-op living, or condominium apartments. The majority of living spaces here are two-family houses though. Most of the people are quite nice, however, very noisy. Every day, you’d hear cars blasting their music as they drive by your house, or constantly flooring the gas on their cars which will wake you up in the morning. If you are planning on visiting during night time, you should be on your guard. This neighborhood is fairly safe, but people are unpredictable. You may run into people who want to start trouble for no reason, bullies and thieves. I myself have been bullied in this neighborhood in the past via physical assault, but this was many years ago. Another recent incident involved package stealing. Although a common thing, there are package thieves in this neighborhood. Last but not least, although New York City has a fine for people not cleaning up after their dogs, people don’t follow the rules here. Every morning, you will see at least one dog waste on your way to the train station, or on your way to the supermarket. My biggest pet peeve is dog waste on the floor everywhere I go in this neighborhood. Be careful and keep your shoes clean!\n",
            "The first thing you have to understand about Portland, Oregon is the definition of \"weird\". The unofficial town slogan, on the back of a building that serves as a pizza joint, bar, music venue, strip club, and skirts the law on at least half of these endeavors, is \"Keep Portland Weird\". To some, this is a small cry to remember the Portland of the 90's and early 2000's, a Portland that was less known and less expensive, generating creative and unique subcultures. To others, it is a beckoning call - come to Portland, where people will still call you weird, but as a compliment this time. Despite the influx of affluent Californians and the constant construction of condominiums to house these Californians, Portland is still weird. Weird does not mean always accepting, but it does mean accepting of things that are normally not accepted. Weird does not mean we do not have modern conveniences and modern fights. Like the rest of the country, we buy most of our things from China. There are a million ways of being weird, of being not normal, but Portland has plenty of normal. Portland has yoga and hipsters and business professionals. Perhaps weird means we just take all of this less seriously. In my neighborhood, as in many Portland neighborhoods, we have colorful houses, home gardens with flowers and herbs and vegetables lining the streets, and free boxes in the summertime. Free boxes are traditionally cardboard boxes containing items someone is getting rid of, but they can be plastic bags or boxes. They contain something magical, a treasure just perfect for the person wandering by, a surprising amount of the time. Free boxes tend to have clothes and books, but they can have anything. The magical potential of walking through a Southeast Portland neighborhood is what Portland is all about. That is, what Portland is all about to me, but I am just one variety of weird among thousands. Some people I live among would never dream of picking their clothes out of a box on the sidewalk. Those people go to goat yoga (yes, yoga with real live goats) or Timbers matches (the city's soccer team). Portland is full of people who love all sorts of things. Portland is full of people who pursue our dreams, or dream about pursuing our dreams while spending too much time at the bar. Yes, Portland has a drug problem. Drug problems tend to be (at their root) mental health problems, and the constant rain through much of the year, plus the dreary clouds, appear to be a contributor. Portland has a homelessness problem too, which no one seems to know what to do with. The homeless population is drawn by the social services Portland offers, better than in most parts of the country, but our services are insufficient, as in all parts of the country. The non-homeless population wavers between care and hatred. In this, we are not weird at all.\n",
            "The mountains are always there. In the north, bearing witness to the sun’s journey every dawn and every dusk. No matter how much I forget about them or how caught up with work and life I am to notice, they are there, unwavering, unopposed, and unphased by life’s tribulations. Then on days when I am the most stressed and wound, they demand to be seen, and when I turn to them they let me rest my anxious soul, lending me some strength to go on, one day at a time. I first moved here when I started my undergrad, and the mountains to the north of campus where what first captivated me. Sure, the university has its own share of breathtaking sights in buildings and ponds and trees, which have their own share of my heart, but it’s the mountains that really holds its throne. The rest of the town is beautiful in its own right. There are countless cafés that were home to many hours of caffeine fueled cramming. One can walk or take the bus just a little further to the downtown area and be enveloped in an aura of antiquity by the faded colored bricks that line restaurants and office buildings. It is here that this seemingly suburban town shows as much bustle and vigor as it’s neighboring urban city. This doesn’t last for many blocks though, as one can escape, once again, to the serene small town by passing the library. This dichotomy of atmospheres in such proximity truly give this city a wonderous vibe as if it was beckoning to be explored. With this, it is easy to create many a cherished memory, each in association with a certain part of town. Whether it is walking past the rusted swings in the park with friends after an all-nighter or running through the busy downtown to catch the movie in the fancy theater for which the university provided tickets. Alas, it is also home to many harsh memories, as all places are bound to be in life. The ponds, in particular, can be a rather fitting place for reflection as well as crying sessions at two in the morning in the middle of an existential crisis. The latter of which, I have more experience in. While watching the turtles and ducks and insects live out their lives, each with some contribution or role, I couldn’t help but wonder about my own sense of purpose as I struggled to navigate this mystery called life. So, I walked past the pond, and past the park and little houses that scream of suburbia, until I reached a main street. It was then that sun shined its brilliant rays atop the palm trees, painting the sky along the way, and as I looked up at the sunrise, I realized I was walking north. Sure enough, they were there, as they had always been. The sturdy overbearing mountains grazed the hazy blue and yellow sky more than any building in the horizon, and as if speaking without words, stirred in me my sense of perseverance.\n",
            "You might pass it up on first glance - after all, it is a residential area behind a shopping strip, not a place one would assume there are places to live. At least, not places most people would want to live. But if you go behind the old, abandoned Whole Foods and walk back behind the hotels which are only occupied annually aside from a few stints in the summertime for family reunions, you'll find an entire bustling community. Within these communities, on these streets, are a handful of apartment complex - situated next to each other carefully like Russian nesting dolls that have been scrupulously, carefully taken apart and set beside each other in a line down the road, piecemeal. The first apartments you come upon are ones which have been on the news for some fairly unsavory dealings, so we won't focus on those too much - appearances, after all, can be deceiving. But the apartments beside that complex, and the two complexes beside that one, are a whole other world that almost no one living in this area knows about. Across from those complexes is a community college's satellite campus - a quiet, sleepy set of buildings standing sentinel beside the road, where students putter in with coffee in hand, yawning at 7 in the morning to begin their sleepy days. The iron gates creak open to admit them one by one, while commuters shake their fists out the window and groan at them for holding up traffic on days attendance is higher. The road t-bones into another residential road, with a park on one side and a rehabilitation center for people who have broken bones in unfortunate circumstances. The treatment center boasts cheerful porch furniture, and a lazily undulating ceiling fan which churns the warm, thick summertime air back and forth. Children run back and forth in the grass at the park across the street, cartwheeling and pinwheeling across the prickly green stalks while bees lazily turn in the flower patches by the road. Old retired folks walk their dogs on the walking path, scowling at the teenagers on their skateboards and nodding demurely at the teenage girls clustered by the playground equipment, gossiping about boys and the latest YouTube sensations. There is a sushi place in a strip mall beside the park that has inexpensive food but never seems too busy - a swimming supply store right beside that, and a nail salon nestled in between. You could fill your pool for the season while getting a manicure and eating hibachi chicken, all at once - the beauty of a strip mall. There is a frozen yogurt place there too, one of the DIY kind, and you often see the teens in the park clutching cold, sweating cups of frozen yogurt covered in toppings while they do stunts on their skateboards and vape because they believe it to be the coolest. The neighborhood in question is a slice of Americana - a piece of history in the sleepy south where hardly anything changes, not even time.\n",
            "My neighborhood is interesting. Most of the houses are single family, but there are a few homes that have been split into two, while still being attached, if that makes much sense. My home has a small yard in front of it and a small driveway to the left of the house. It, like most of the others, reminds you of a time not so long ago where living in the suburbs was the American dream. This dream at once seemed to embrace the people of this country, but now its pulling away. But my neighborhood and many more still remain, still call out to us and those who visit that the dream is still alive, and we are still holding onto it as best we can. The people don't feel as optomistic as they used to, the upkeep of the little yards are not what they used to be, but there is still a car or two in every driveway, still the youth play as if the world around them was the whole of their existence. The public school that has been here for almost 90 years still stands, still seems conjure a future in today's youth, while stirring up nostalgia in the older residents. The churches are few and far between, mostly empty, but the basketball courts are still full. All of the homes look different, but feel the same. There is a large supermarket called super \"A\" that has been owned by a large Yemni family, who are quite possible the only Arab family in the neighborhood. The vast majority of the residents are African American. The streets are wide and the kids usually play footbal, only stopping to allow the cars to pass. Most of the people in my neighborhood have been here for generations and most can tell stories of a past where everyone knew everyone. There was a karate school, but when hollywood stopped making karate kid movies, the kids stopped wanting to be the karate kid, so its now a pharmacy, because drugs make everything better, or so I've heard. There is also a small movie theatre that plays old movies at a discounted price, spared from the crowds by the youth's disdane for its lack of just release titles, but favored by the elders, who think it is a small price to pay for a night out, without the kids of course. There is a single expressway that passes through my town. Though the exit and entrance are in the town next to ours. There was once a petition to get and exit for our town. The youth supported it, while the elders refused. It seems that having the expressway in our town would ruin it, so said the elders who eventually persuaded the city council to deny the request. They are building a new highschool, and we are trying to decide on a mascott for our town. I think a cyborg with a country accent and a log cabin would be then best representation of my town.\n",
            "Since I live in a large city, my neighborhood is extremely diverse. Residential areas are dispersed, seemingly randomly, between commercial areas, where a variety of businesses are run. Some of these businesses are made up of offices, while others are various stores, restaurants, and places of entertainment. There is no shortage of new restaurants to eat at, or stores to shop in. While some stores are large, well-known, brands that are owned by large corporations, small boutiques are also increasingly popular. They are not only located in various malls, but they also line the streets, which are often in walking distance of neighborhoods that would otherwise be quiet and serene, if not surrounded by so many points of interest. There are also a couple of nearby parks, and I have noticed that people frequent these parks with their young children. Speaking of the people, thereâ€™s actually quite a bit of diversity within my neighborhood. In one small location, we have a prominent LGBTQ+ community, an Orthodox Jewish community, and a collection of refugees and immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Spanning a little further outside of my neighborhood, there are many more individuals of various races and origins, although they are sometimes broken up into their own little communities within the city. We have locations known as Korea town, China town, Little Armenia, and many more, which are only a few miles away. However, only a few miles can prove to be a very lengthy drive. Driving a distance of only 10 miles can sometimes span two hours, due to traffic, especially during rush hour. Hardly anyone in my city walks anywhere, though. While certain locations of interest are inevitably close-by, the city is huge, and people do not generally prefer to commute on foot. As a result, we also have some of the worst traffic in the world, and it can be difficult to find parking spots just about anywhere. Ironically enough, there has been a great deal of construction in recent years, as large apartment buildings are being added to the city. It is seems to be a popular destination, but many residents are disappointed by the prospect of even more people moving in, and even more vehicles on the roads. There are many different types of houses in my city, however. Not everyone lives, or wishes to live, in a large apartment building. Residential areas are made up of houses, of various sizes, and smaller apartment buildings and condominiums. Some properties contain single-family homes, while others contain duplexes. This is true even within my immediately neighborhood, so there is also no lack of diversity in regards to housing options. Similarly, the neighborhood is made up of people of varying ages, and to be perfectly honest, I am not familiar with the majority of my neighbors. It is not really a tight-knit community these days, although I have many memories from my childhood of playing outside with my next-door neighbor, and a few other friends from the neighborhood, who were all close to my age.\n",
            "“Where is everything?” she asked as we drove past the corn fields which filled the horizon. “This is it!” I said, knowing she’d be in shock of the sparseness of the open landscape. She was from a town in which the grocery store was a 5 minute walk from her house--she’d never seen this much open space in her life. Taken back by the ubiquity of corn fields, I shared with her what it was like to grow up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew who I was and where I came from. Driving down a two-lane country road, you will reach a quarry which is filled with water. Just past it is the small development I live in. The houses are mostly composed of brick and stucco. All the houses have at least a half an acre of land to themselves which everyone takes pride in maintaining. During springtime, annually planted flowers are abundant along with the midwestern trees that change with every season. The driveways are all filled with the highest end Mercedes Benz luxury cars that glisten in the midday sun after a good, old-fashioned car wash. Continuing along the road toward my grey stucco home, my Korean neighbor is always outside with a friendly face. He tends to spend the entire day mowing his lawn and can be heard singing over his mower’s hum. Everyone in the neighborhood gets a laugh out of him, but he is always genuine and an amazing person with a unique history. He has grown older and has lost some of his wit as he aged. In his past he was a doctor and usually blends in with the grass and his John Deer Zero Turn mower. Finally, you will reach my home. In the side yard, geese are abundant and are chased by our Terrier. Out back, there is a small stream that feeds into the quarry. Here, you can hear bullfrogs, the stream, and the occasional “moo” from the nearby farms. Across the handmade wooden bridge is an untouched oasis filled with naturally growing trees, herbs, and wildflowers. Here was where I spent most of my childhood. From building tree forts to ‘hunting’ animals (which mostly consisted of chasing them), there was always something to do and usually a neighborhood child available for friendship. The winters in my small town can be painfully brutal, yet there is nothing more beautiful. The yard transforms from a sea of green into an empty wilderness. The trees that once housed vibrant pink, purple, and orange flowers turn into barren skeletons of bark. When blessed with the occasional snowfall, a winter wonderland appears overnight. The backyard is lined with snow angels made by my little sister, and snowmen. My sister and I fought frequently as kids, and during the winter, snowballs were our weapon of choice. We’d build massive igloo-like forts to house our weapons, usually with branches, like an arsenal. In our own little wonderland was where we played pretend during a time where nothing else mattered. We were just young kids without a care in the world.\n"

            "In the quiet heart of rural America, in a small town in Michigan where the land shifts from sprawling farmland to quaint tourist enclaves, there are no sprawling city malls or chains of commerce like Wal-Mart or Target or even an Applebee's. Here, journeys are measured in miles, and the roads lead you through a landscape kissed by water's edge. The town, my place in this world, is held in the embrace of water. To one side the vastness of Lake Michigan, to the other, the more intimate Lake Charlevoix, each offering their beaches where one might wade in the cool embrace of the waves.\n\nThe neighborhood here speaks of small-town life, where houses breathe with space, not stacked like bricks in a wall but standing alone, each with its own story. They are not the uniform creations of modern times but homes of another era, some renewed, others holding the patina of years. These homes stand with basements that show their faces to the road, and many are clad in the old armor of aluminum siding, their colors as varied as the leaves in autumn. Yards spread out before them, dotted with trampolines and playsets, gardens where the earth yields its bounty, and fences that hold back the creatures of the household.\n\nThis place is Middle America, where the people work by the sweat of their brows, raising families or having seen their children grow and leave. The streets are alive with the laughter of children, the rhythmic slap of dog paws, the hum of bicycles and the whisper of rollerblades. Neighbors nod to neighbors, and the strangers are known by the absence of recognition. A wave to a man at the grill, a smile to the woman walking a dog from far down the block. The lawns are neat, the grass clipped and green, leaves not left to gather and rot. It is not a neighborhood that dazzles with its beauty, but one that comforts with its promise—a place where families are raised in the quiet certainty of peace, a sanctuary at day’s end.\n\nNearby, the county sheriff’s station stands watch, the health department close by, the city’s recycling center a stone’s throw away, all serving the people here. The fields of baseball and softball echo with the announcer’s calls, the small town airport abuzz with the drone of engines as small planes rise and fall in the sky. An ice cream shop beckons within a stroll, and the downtown’s heart can be reached by foot from this circle of homes. My children ride their bikes to a park not far off, a mere eight blocks away. It is a good place, a fine place to call home.",
            "The land where I find myself is a place of sameness, a tract of earth where houses stand in neat rows like soldiers at attention, each one a mirror to the next. Here the hand of the homeowner’s association is felt keen and sharp, shaping the world to its will. The lawns are clipped and tidy, a green uniformity broken only by stones set in patterns and the occasional tree, stunted and solitary. In the driveways, cars sit in pairs, sheltered beneath the roofs of twin garages. The streets themselves are smooth as glass, unmarred by the scars of time or neglect. No cracks, no holes. Just the unbroken sweep of new-laid concrete.\n\nThe houses rise mostly in single story, though here and there a second floor reaches skyward, an anomaly amid the conformity. There are no mailboxes before each door. Instead, at the street’s end, a cluster of metal boxes waits, keys in hand, to unlock the letters and packages within. The HOA has seen to this, their desire for order manifest in little things.\n\nWe stand at the city's edge, this place neither fully rural nor wholly suburban, but a blending of both. The land spreads wide and open, with room enough for pools where the water shivers under the sun, and trails that wind through the quiet, waiting for the feet of those who walk alone or with a dog at heel. The old come here to rest, their days measured in the slow drift of time. The young are fewer, but they are here too, mingling with their elders.\n\nThe city beyond is a contradiction, vast in its number but small in its heart. It has all that one might need, though never too much. A mall stands solitary, humble in its offerings, yet enough to serve. To reach the stores and the life of the city takes but a short drive, and once there, all the world unfolds. The rich foods and the cheap, the grand shops and the small. It is a place where needs are met, and yet, this is a world that asks nothing more than to be as it is. Safe and kept, a piece of the whole, and nothing more.",
            "The first I heard tell of the place was from a voice on a podcast, recounting tales of souls who had vanished into the ether. It took me by surprise. Here was a world where each apartment fetched over a thousand dollars a month and yet this story was unknown to me and mine. Perhaps it is the struggle. I know friends who lay awake in the night, eyes wet with tears. Life is dear, but we have learned to scrape by, finding beauty in the dust of flea market toys and clothes long packed away. The scent of adulthood is like a dusty magazine stacked upon a forgotten piano. It seeps into the leather and lingers long after the washing is done. Here, within a stone’s throw, lie three thrift stores. If you begin at one end, you can visit two charity thrifts, a library, a rare book store, and a curio shop. Downtown is a hive, cars and people thronging the streets with the dawn, yet within the thrift stores, silence reigns. No matter how many souls pass by, the quiet holds. It’s a fine spot to while away the hours. Each year, the flood of cars and people grows. They call it a city in bloom, headquarters to one of the great online empires. It bears the scars of its growth still. It recalls New York to mind. Each person, each thing, pursues its own end, and not much is asked of you. You can keep to yourself, be still and silent, and folks will let you be. Unlike the South, where a touch of concern shows care, here lives go unexamined. You can maintain your shell as long as you wish, and the city will rise and fall like waves upon the shore. It's a place alive with sound. Between the pianist next door and the singers above, there’s always a tune in the air. In a fashion, we are less strangers in apartments and more a circle of friends. We gather for our needs, mark the passing of years, grieve and celebrate together, and lend a hand when we can. I count myself fortunate to be here. My neighbors are a good sort, and they treat me kindly. I keep the place tidy, share what I can, and they return the favor. We exchange letters and visits. It’s a simple pleasure, seeing them, and I believe they find some joy in my company as well. I dwell in this vast, impersonal expanse of modernity, yet it is the likes of my neighbors who make me feel perhaps I have not squandered my days entirely.",
            "In a small town perched on the edge of the city’s sprawl, where the east wind carries whispers of better times, I dwell. This place, neither forgotten nor entirely remembered, lies where the suburbs end and the earth begins to reclaim its own. The east side, where I make my home, is a patchwork of weary houses. Their paint long since faded, homes to souls who wrestle with an invisible hand that keeps their dreams tethered low to the ground. Yet the people are not without their grace. Faces that greet you with the warmth of a weary sun, nodding as you pass, their smiles worn but sincere. \n\nHere, the specter of crime lurks in the shadows, a part of the place like wind through the empty branches, though it seldom shows its face. In the decade past, violence has struck like sudden summer storms, leaving behind a silence more profound than before. Last year, the family next door lost their boy to a gunshot, a life ended outside the dim glow of a tavern’s neon promise. Our own steps have been lighter, with only the occasional loss of small things left too long on the porch, a reminder of the precarious peace we hold.\n\nThis town bears the scars of the opioid plague, a tragedy too great to be borne in silence. Lives extinguished by the quiet poison of fentanyl, their absence felt in the spaces they no longer fill. Yet in this darkness, there is light. Places of healing, where the lost might find their way back, and hands reaching out with the knowledge of Narcan, offering a lifeline where hope had faltered.\n\nIn the midst of these tribulations, the town holds fast to its virtues. My son’s school, a haven of laughter and learning, where kindness is the currency and differences are celebrated rather than scorned. The staff, from the principal's steady hand to the teachers’ guiding voices, create a world where he feels safe, loved. Events weave the families together, a tapestry of community and connection, each thread stronger for its neighbor.\n\nThough the weight of poverty hangs heavy, no child is left to hunger. The school ensures every one eats, breaking bread with dignity, the meals a daily act of grace. The burdens of fees and trips are lightened, allowing each child to walk unencumbered by want. The City Council, in their wisdom, has breathed new life into the heart of the town. Roads smooth as river stones, parks where laughter echoes, though the east side remains a landscape of neglect, its needs overshadowed by the commerce-driven west.\n\nYet I find solace here. The faces familiar, the kindnesses small but genuine. The shops sufficient to clothe and feed us, the house a haven, humble but ours. Sixteen years have passed in this place, our roots entwined with the earth beneath. We cannot imagine another land, another home. This town, flawed and beautiful, is where we belong.",
            "The neighborhood lies sprawled across the hill, a place thick with stories and shadows. High above, the buildings stand, sentinels of history, with their facades etched by time. I reside in a seven-story edifice, staring out at the old theater, its presence a whisper of yesteryear's grandeur. Down the slope, a block away, sits a vibrant arcade bar where souls of all kinds gather like moths to a flame on those balmy summer eves. When June turns to July, the line stretches long and winding, a testament to the life that pulses here. The park, a stone’s throw north, sprawls wide, a hidden oasis amidst the city's concrete heart. In winter’s chill, the homeless find solace, raising their tents in ordered lines upon the pavement and steps. The snow seldom falls, but the rain, it comes in sheets, a relentless curtain that chills to the bone. They huddle close, seeking warmth in the city's core, near the family center where they might wash away the cold.\n\nYet it is not the buildings nor the bygone elegance that holds my heart. It is the people, the culture, alive in every face and every corner. Hilltop, once notorious, carries the weight of its past in stories whispered through alleys and across generations. They speak of a time when the government swept through, a storm trying to cleanse the streets. The people remember, and they pass these tales on, even to newcomers like me. Though the streets still bear the scars, the community strives to keep them clean, to hold onto hope. They say if your skin is pale, the night is not yours in Hilltop. But this warning is a ghost, an echo of old fears. Perhaps I am dark enough to blend, or maybe I am simply a child of Hilltop, aware of the shadows that linger, the reminders of a world not yet healed. Here, racism and fear still weave their threads, even in this supposed melting pot.\n\nYet no matter where I wander, Hilltop calls to me. The night streets are alive, and in them, I find my place. The people are kind, offering warmth instead of harm. The laundromat stays open for me to find shelter from the storm. And on the bleakest nights, when I imagine myself unseen, someone will pause, look into my eyes, press a bill into my hand, and remind me of my worth. In this place, I am home.",
            "I came to this place when the world was just opening up to me at the start of eighth grade. There was a solitude in those first days, a quiet unfamiliarity that lingered like a shadow, but soon the silence gave way to voices and the faces of friends. There were two of them, living near as the crow flies, their laughter and stories becoming a part of the air I breathed. They've since gone on to other places, yet their presence remains etched in the corners of memory. The people who greeted me at the outset are still here, their lives woven into the fabric of this suburban expanse.\n\nThe neighborhood sprawls like a tapestry of two-story homes. On weekends, when the sun warms the earth, the voices of children rise up, a chorus of innocence carried on the breeze. The weekdays whisper a different music, one of stillness and the quiet hum of life passing by. Here, in this enclave, troubles are few, and solitude is a choice, not a sentence. Packages left on doorsteps remain untouched, a testament to a trust that binds one neighbor to the next.\n\nA stone's throw from my door lies a park, a realm of recollections. It's a place where the echoes of basketballs and footballs linger, where victories and defeats played out beneath the wide sky. It holds both laughter and pain, like the time a misstep left me with a bloody nose. Yet even that memory, sharp as it was, is softened by the warmth of so many afternoons spent in the company of friends. Now, the park is a domain I share with my cousin's children, their joy tangible as they swing and slide, the world a wonder to their eyes.\n\nThis neighborhood speaks in many tongues, its diversity a testament to the life it holds. Within a short stretch of road, the scents of Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Italian kitchens mingle, though many now turn to the convenience of meals brought to their door by unseen hands. Fast food joints, ubiquitous in their presence, share the streets with pizza parlors, each offering a slice of familiarity. The stores, varied and plentiful, stand ready to meet every need. A Walgreens and a CVS stand sentinel on the main thoroughfare, alongside a Jewel-Osco, the Midwest's contribution to the grocery world. Even the stores reflect the neighborhood's mosaic, as an Indian-owned shop offers both homemade and ready-made flavors from afar.\n\nIn this place, I find a quiet contentment. The stories of others, their neighborhoods filled with strife and discord, serve as a reminder of the peace I have found here. For that, I am grateful.",
            "In the shadow of the college where I study lies the neighborhood I call home, a place stitched together by apartment blocks and the occasional haunt where one might find a drink or a meal without emptying their pockets. There's a bar, newly christened, where the prices climb higher but the spirits and service remain as ever they were, not the worst a man might find. The folk here are mostly students or those of lesser means, drawn by the modest rents that beckon from the buildings, old as they may seem from without, their hearts perhaps renewed. Children spill from the nearby school, their laughter carried on the wind, and though I see my neighbors, I know them not nor wish to, their habits of smoke and weed a jest to my boyfriend and I, what with the management’s crude attempt at masking the scent with air fresheners. \n\nDown the way stand new apartments, shiny and false, their very walls a testament to haste and thrift, yet they demand a king's ransom for rent. A scam it seems, yet they thrive on their proximity to campus, luring tenants with their glittering facade. There's a place, not five minutes on foot, where food comes on paper plates and the microwave hums its sad tune, a testament to cheap sustenance. Across lies a gas station, whispered about in tones that speak of hardship. But the summer past brought change to the road, a gift from the city that laid down wide sidewalks and green medians, a touch of grace upon the land, though my building stands ensconced in trees, a grove that holds the world at bay. Not all survived the culling, for stumps stand sentinel, reminders of what was, yet still the trees outnumber those down the street. \n\nBeyond my home, another street runs, 43rd, its visage less kind. The sidewalks crumble and the buildings wear their age like a shroud. Here are trees too, perhaps to cloak the decay. Crime finds purchase in the complex down the street, but it’s not the only one to blame. Across from me, another den of transience, where people come and go like the turning of a page. Yet I find solace where I am, for it is within my means, and the conveniences gather around me like old friends. The university is but a short walk, and two bus stops stand ready to carry me to the store or to the heart of the city with ease.",
            "The street runs in a circle, a cul-de-sac where duplexes stand like solitary sentinels, their facades washed in the same sunbaked yellow. Each wears a white porch like a collar and a green metal roof that gleams under the sky's indifferent blue gaze. These are not just houses but homes, tethered by the thin thread of friendly discourse, neighbors gathering at the cusp of driveways to share words as the sun dips low, their children painting the world with chalk or chasing the wind with kites. It is a place out of time, where the mechanical hum of modernity seems but a distant echo.\n\nFields and trees shoulder the neighborhood, standing sentinel beneath the vast sky where clouds billow like sails on a forgotten sea. Yet there is a darkness that looms. This season the air is thick with the promise of storms, sirens wailing their ghostly warning. Last night the sound came, a siren's keen lament, and we sought the refuge of our shelters. I sat in the bathtub, clutching my smallest dog, my purse, and a few pillows, while my large dog paced the living room, restless as the storm itself. The world outside was silent but for the hail's ferocious tattoo upon the earth. \n\nWhen at last the storm relented, the road exhaled steam, a ghostly breath from the sudden shift in temperature. The heat refused to yield, and the hail melted upon the pavement's embrace. Above, the sky began to clear, and the sun's fingers reached down through the rain, painting a double rainbow upon the canvas of the heavens. I ran for my camera, capturing the fleeting wonder to share with those distant through the cold glass screen. They marveled, and so did I. \n\nThe quiet held the streets in its arms for a time, until the world awoke and life returned, mothers calling their children in as dinner simmered. It is a place of kindness, this new home of mine, far from where I once stood in New Hampshire. The southern drawl wraps around words like a warm shawl. I reside in a two-bedroom place, as do all here, though within each the space changes, some rooms shrinking into themselves. It is a mystery. \n\nBehind my dwelling, a great field stretches out, a green expanse leading to a pond that forbids the caress of swimmers. Deer wander there, and in the morning the bullfrog's song rises like a hymn. It is a good place to live, a mere forty minutes from the city's pulse. The dawn is heralded by roosters crowing from nearby farms, a call to a new day. A donkey brays in the evening, reminding us all of our place in this small village-like world. I have found a jewel in this place, a sanctuary in the southern soil.",
            "In the long years since I first set foot here, the years that have come and gone like pages blown across a field, I reckon I’ve learned a thing or two. I recall the sorrow that took hold of me when we left Riverdale. The tears I shed as we departed for Stockbridge, a place unknown and unwelcome then. But my folks wanted better, always better, for me and my sister. The houses were finer, the schools were finer. They said it wasn’t ghetto and that was reason enough. In time, I made peace with it, found friends and foes in equal measure at the school. The neighbors, they mostly stayed strangers, save for Mr. Glen and his kin, Dennis too, living right beside us. They've been a lot like family in their own ways and I hold them dear. I remember the day we all went to Mr. Glen’s wedding, him and Ms. Veda tying the knot anew. A day of joy and laughter, a glimpse of what I hope to find as I lay stones on my own path, dreaming of a life fit for a queen. When Ms. Veda tossed that little white garter, it was me who caught it, though the flowers slipped through my fingers. We danced till the stars wore thin, Marsharii and me. Haven’t seen her since. Hope she's found her own way. The neighborhood, it’s a tangle of streets and turns, though these days I’ve got a GPS to guide me. I’ve wandered a bit, mostly with Kason and Curtis, my companions in the art of idling. We played our games, lived our lives with a fervor only youth can muster. Sometimes I’d find my way to the park, seeking the solace only nature bestows. There’s a peace in it, a calm. I’d bring my sticks from the depot, honing balance, wielding my wooden sword against the unseen foes of the world. There’s a court for basketball and tennis, long abandoned by me but there still, waiting should the urge to play return. My father, he taught us tennis alongside Mr. Graves. We sweated and laughed under the sun’s watchful eye. There’s stories aplenty, tales of joy and hardship woven into the fabric of this place. And yet, I feel the best is still to come, waiting just beyond the horizon.",
            "In the heart of South Carolina lies a town unassuming in its quietude, a place where the world seems to slow and the dust settles gently on the roadways. Johnston, they call it, a name that whispers through the fields of peach and cattle. Claiming its fame as the Peach Capital of the World, its sign stands with a pride that belies its simplicity, welcoming all who wander through its borders. The land is vast and open, a patchwork of farms and fields, where the earth yields its bounty under the relentless sun. The houses, when they appear, sit back from the road, nestled in the embrace of their own expanse, roofs of metal or shingle guarding against the summer's wrath. \n\nIn the heart of the town, a lone stoplight marks the crossroad, casting its red and green upon the handful of stores that stand resolute. A Chinese place called Hong Kong, a fiesta of Mexican fare, and Gary's burgers offer their fast relief to weary travelers. Once, there was a pizzeria, but its doors have long since closed, leaving behind only the memory of its warmth. A pharmacy named Maxwell and Halford Drug persists, known not for its remedies but for the cherry cola that flows sweet and sticky from its coolers. The IGA stands as the sole purveyor of groceries, though its aisles see fewer feet, as many choose the journey to Walmart in distant Batesburg-Leesville.\n\nYet, it is Dollar General that draws the town's life to it, a marketplace of necessity where the rhythm of commerce beats steady from dawn till dusk. Nearby, a furniture store, Possibilities, remains a testament to endurance, its owner a fixture in the tapestry of Johnston's people. And beside it, Clark's Cuts and Kennels, a sanctuary for creatures great and small, offers its gentle care.\n\nThe town's edges hold a doctor’s office and a veterinary practice, small sanctuaries of healing for the folks who call this place home. The children gather at Johnston Elementary, their laughter and learning confined until the fifth grade, whereupon they must journey to a neighboring town for further schooling. No parks grace this land yet, though plans unfurl for a modest stretch of recreation to bring life to its soil.\n\nThere is little to occupy one's time here, no theaters or lanes for bowling, no places for idle gatherings, yet the town holds its charm in the whispers of its streets and the stories of its soil. It is a place so small you might pass it by, a mere blink and gone, yet within its bounds lies a world entire, quiet and enduring.",
            "In the heart of a small southern town in Tennessee, I find myself settled in a suburb like many others. The street runs between two state highways, and it draws more traffic than one might care for, but beyond that, the neighborhood rests in a kind of quietude. Folks around here don't come and go much, and so the faces remain familiar, each etched into the landscape like the trees that stand sentinel over us. Busy with their yards and the daily grind of living, they pass the seasons in simple labors. Winter sees children sledding down the hill by the side street, their laughter carried on the cold air. Our house sits at the front corner, and from there, we watch the world slide by, noting the cars, the strangers among them, a measure of vigilance we all keep. Neighbors walk their dogs or themselves, and children roam on bikes as if tethered to the past.\n\nOur days revolve around this place, home in more ways than one, for work ties us to its walls. Four of us fill its rooms—myself, my wife, and our daughters, eleven and fourteen. We weave ourselves into the fabric of this street, coming and going as thread through a loom. Sometimes, we spill out into the rain, oblivious to its chill, and the grill on the back deck sends sweet smoke into the world, a scent that blends with the incessant hum of lawnmowers from March till October when the grass gives up its growth. The trees here are plentiful, remnants of the forest that once was, and they cast their shadows long. But come fall, they shed their leaves, and we rake them into piles to burn. The scent of burning leaves is a harbinger of the season, a reminder that fall has taken hold.\n\nThe winters of late do not bite as they once did, leaving autumn to linger in their stead. Our garage, tucked at the back of the house, sees more use than the front door. It's there I work on my truck or tinker with whatever project calls to me, the open doors a window into the life that unfolds beyond. Holidays bring a hush over the street, except for the swell of cars when families gather from afar. Thanksgiving, Mother's Day, Christmas, each marks its time with the arrival of visitors. In all of it, there is a sense of belonging, and though the road runs through, it feels like home enough. If only it were a road that ended, it might be perfect.",
            "In the heart of the high desert, where the earth sprawls in the eternal embrace of dust and sand, my neighborhood rests in a quiet defiance against time. The land is a tapestry of brown, a hue that stretches to the horizons, and only those who call this place home truly grasp the omnipresence of this color. Green lawns are a rarity, a testament to fortunes spent on coaxing life from the arid soil. Back in the nineties, the houses lay scattered like seeds sown by a wandering hand, and though the years have passed, the earth remains much the same, albeit dotted now with new constructions rising like stubborn monuments. This place, it grows more akin to a city with each passing day, a fate shared by many lands in this changing world. \n\nThe folk here, they carry the warmth of the desert sun, mostly kind, though like any city, shadows linger in corners. My own street harbors the elderly, gentle souls who mark this as a place of neighborly grace. The stores are those of chains, familiar names like Food 4 Less and Smart & Final. For finer fare, one must journey afar; Whole Foods and such are strangers in these parts. The work that draws men here is the building of things, for this city is yet unfinished, vast spaces waiting to be claimed by the hands of men. It holds a certain dread for me, this march of progress, for I fled the clamor of a great city and have no wish to return. \n\nConstruction is my trade, the art of drywall and T-bar, and in this craft, I find my daily bread. Yet what endears this place to me, beyond the toil, is the life that thrives despite the harshness. The desert is a canvas painted with creatures that dart and scuttle, a wonderland for my children who chase lizards and beetles under the unyielding sun. High desert climes forge ecosystems both fragile and fierce, demanding respect from those who dwell here. We, my kin and I, have learned to live in harmony with these wild neighbors. \n\nIn our town, attractions are few but cherished. Victorville, it stands as a gateway to the desert's embrace, offering families a taste of its rugged beauty. The annual San Bernardino County Fair breathes life into our days, a carnival of joy and simple pleasures. Beyond, the mountains of Wrightwood beckon, their snow-clad peaks a siren's call to those seeking winter's touch. For those drawn to the stories of earth and man, the Victor Valley Museum holds tales of stone and bone, of the people who carved their lives into this unforgiving land.\n\nThus, in this arid cradle, life persists, a testament to resilience, and in its quiet persistence, I find a certain peace.",
            "In the waking hours when the light is yet faint and the world trembles on the brink of another day’s unfolding, I reckon my neighborhood in a way perhaps less common, less known. Others might speak of tidy houses in a row, each with its own tale and hearth, but mine is a sprawl of academic halls and dormitories, the college grounds my own peculiar province. The people who dwell here, they form the heart of my community, though beyond the brick and mortar they too stretch, like the branches of some ancient tree, into the wider campus, which serves as my neighborhood in its own wild and unyielding way. \n\nIt is the same and yet not the same as the neighborhoods of old with their quiet streets and corner stores. Here too are places of dwelling, people moving like shadows across the green, stores with their wares, and parks with their solemn retreat. Let me lay before you the dwellings that mark this place. There are three kinds as I know them: apartments, houses, and the dormitory halls. \n\nThe apartments, they stack and rise like books upon a shelf, each room holding two to four souls, and floors numbering two, maybe more. Twenty souls or so gather in such a space, living, breathing, learning. Then there are the houses, a rare thing, scattered like seeds among the grounds, filled often with alumni, those who once were and now remain tied to the school’s embrace. \n\nBut most common are the dormitories, vast and teeming, where hundreds lay their heads, sharing rooms, sharing lives, in a community that pulses and shifts like the tide. \n\nIn this place, diversity is the law, as unyielding as gravity. Faces from all corners of the earth find themselves here, drawn to this place of learning. The staff find refuge in houses, the young ones in dormitories, and the elder students, wiser perhaps, in the apartments. \n\nThe people defy description, each a world unto themselves, and so let us speak instead of the stores and parks. This college, this self-contained universe, holds within it all manner of stores, from those that feed the body to those that clothe it, unique in their offerings yet familiar, the scent of academia upon them. \n\nAnd the park, a refuge amidst the stone and glass, is a gathering place for the diverse souls, a sanctuary kept safe by the hands of the community, clean and free from the shadows that plague the world beyond. \n\nIn this place, everything needed lies within reach, the boundaries of the neighborhood holding all things fast, as if in the embrace of a world entire.",
            "In the place where I live sidewalks are a rarity. All things seem to flow downward, cresting at the house at the top of the steepest hill in the neighborhood. They call it the workout hill. Joggers test their mettle against its incline, running up the narrow road where the pavement bears the scars of time and weather. Pits and ruts that make for treacherous driving. The telephone and electric wires drape from pole to pole, tattered and forlorn. Storms rage in this country, and the wind and the rain bring down branches that strike at the lines. Repairs leave them a patchwork shamble. Tall evergreens rise everywhere about, though folks here despise them. They cut them down to clear the view of the ocean, building their homes high atop the hill with great glass walls to drink in the vista of the bay. At sunset, when the light beneath the waves ignites and the sky burns orange, it is a beauty that wounds the soul. Yet more often than not clouds hang low, and the sun's rays come filtered through a haze. Days are damp and overcast, and moss creeps over every surface it can claim: roofs and cars and railings alike. I left my car in the drive for a month and when I returned it was green and furred with moss, and it took hours to scrape it clean.  \n\nChildren are few in these parts, despite the school not far off. The neighbors are mostly older, retired, their lawns populated by dogs in place of offspring. The dogs roam free, racing down the street, and if a door or window is left ajar they may slip inside. I found one in the living room once, had to shoo it out the front door. Rabbits run wild, too, and some grow large, digging up the roots of plants, burrowing into lawns, much to the gardeners' dismay. My cats hunt them with a vengeance, driving them from our vicinity. Birds flit about, sparrows and hummingbirds, with the hawks and eagles sometimes swooping low until the crows rise to chase them off.  \n\nThere's no store nearby, but if you head down the hill toward the waterfront, you'll find a handful of restaurants serving fresh catch. The beach is scant, more rock than sand, but the stones make for good throwing into the bay, which is not wide. Even through the mist you can see the far shore, a line across the water, constant and unyielding.",
            "In the sprawling cityscape of New York, there's a place called Bensonhurst. It's not hard to find, not with public transportation weaving through like sinews in a great beast. This urban enclave holds all the chaos and vibrancy of the city itself. Walk the streets and you'll meet the eyes of the Asian storefronts, a testament to the waves of souls who came seeking something on these shores. Two decades of change have painted the neighborhood in new colors, the lines of its face altered yet familiar.\n\nThe markets and laundromats—they stand sentinel on each block, their doors open to the world. The food is good, the prices fair, and convenience reigns supreme in this corner of the city. In a stretch no longer than a child's laughter, four supermarkets cater to the needs of the people. This is Bensonhurst, diverse in its bones and sinews, with generations of immigrants mingling among the streets. The businesses, large and small, ripple with the influence of their Asian proprietors, shaping the rhythm of daily life.\n\nThere's a park nearby, where the city's children run free. Ten basketball courts, fields wide enough for the dreams of soccer and baseball, handball walls to echo the slap of a ball. Swings and a playground offer respite, and in the heat of summer, a fountain becomes a haven. Here, the fabric of humanity is as varied as the city itself, each stitch a different hue.\n\nBuildings rise here and there, co-ops and condos, but mostly it's the houses, two families to a plot, that hold the stories of the people. The air is alive with sound, music blaring from cars, engines roaring in the dawn. It's a noisy place, but the noise is life. Yet, when night falls, you must tread carefully. The streets can turn on you, and in their shadows lurk the unpredictable. Memories of assaults long past and packages pilfered from doorsteps linger like ghosts.\n\nThe city's rules are a whisper against the wind. Fines for unheeded norms, for the mess left by dogs on their morning rounds. You walk, eyes cast downward, wary of where you place your feet. It's the smallest things that can unsettle you, the little grievances that gnaw at the edges of your peace. In Bensonhurst, as in all places, you find the good and the less so, side by side, as the city goes on, ever living, ever changing.",
            "In the heart of Portland, Oregon, there's a thread you must grasp to understand its soul, and that thread is called \"weird.\" Painted bold on the backside of a building—a place that wears many masks as a pizza joint, a bar, a music venue, and skirts the edges of the law—is the town's unofficial creed: \"Keep Portland Weird.\" For some, it echoes a lament for the Portland of yesteryears, the nineties and early two-thousands, a city less known, less burdened by cost, a crucible of creativity and subcultures. For others, it's a siren call—come to Portland, where \"weird\" is not a slur but a badge of honor. Even as the city swells with newcomers from California, the skyline crammed with condominiums to house them, Portland remains steadfastly weird. Yet, weird does not always embrace; it simply lets things be that which they usually are not. It does not mean we shun modernity or the battles it brings. Like the rest of the land, we import our goods from China. There are countless ways to be weird, to flout the norm, yet Portland is no stranger to the mundane. It's a city of yoga and hipsters and suited professionals. Perhaps to be weird here is to carry it all with a lighter heart. My neighborhood, like many, is a tapestry of painted houses and gardens that spill over with flowers, herbs, and vegetables, where free boxes sprout like wildflowers in the summer. These boxes, humble cardboard or plastic, offer up their contents to the wanderer—a gift, a treasure meant for the one who finds it. They hold clothes and books, sometimes more, sometimes less, but always a promise of serendipity. This is the magic of walking through a Southeast Portland street—that is, what it means to me, though I am but one shade in a spectrum of weird. Among us, some would never stoop to pick their clothes from a sidewalk box. They seek their strangeness in goat yoga or the roaring stands of Timbers matches. Portland is a haven for those who love their passions fiercely, whether they chase dreams or find them at the bottom of a glass in a dim-lit bar. Yes, we have our demons. Drugs seep through the city like rain through the gutters, their root often in the mind's shadows, fed by the endless rain and the gray sky's weight. Homelessness is a specter that haunts us, a puzzle with no easy answer. Our city's hands stretch out with services, better than most, yet never enough, like elsewhere. Between care and disdain, we sway, and in this we are not weird at all.",
            "The mountains stood eternal in their northern fastness, bearing witness to the sun's rites at every dawn and dusk, indifferent to the stirrings of man or the petty tides of his days. They watched, unblinking, as I moved through the world below, their presence a constant, immutable truth. In times of turmoil, when life pressed upon me with its myriad demands, they summoned my gaze, demanding to be seen, offering a moment's respite to my restless soul. It was here I came as a young scholar, drawn to the university nestled in their shadow. The mountains claimed me first, their majesty eclipsing the allure of the stately buildings and tranquil ponds of the campus. The town, too, held its charms, a tapestry of quaint cafés where many a night was spent in caffeine-induced study. A short journey brought one to the heart of the town, where the faded bricks of old buildings whispered of a history rich and enduring. Here, the town pulsed with the vigor of life, a brief mimicry of the bustling city nearby, yet all too soon it yielded back to the quietude of its suburban soul. This dance of contrasts, the city's restless energy and the town's serene quietude, invited exploration and the weaving of memories. There were nights spent wandering, laughter echoing past rusty swings, or racing through the vibrant streets to catch a show, the tickets a gift from the university. Yet, the town also bore witness to life's harsher truths, as all places must. The ponds, especially, became a refuge for reflection or the silent tears of existential doubt in the small hours. I found myself pondering my place in the great tapestry of life, watching the turtles and ducks and insects, each playing their part. And so I walked, past the pond and park and the rows of houses steeped in suburban quiet, until I reached the main street. The sun cast its golden light upon the palm trees, the sky a canvas of blue and yellow, and I realized my steps had led me northward. There they were, the mountains, steadfast and towering, grazing the sky with their ancient forms. In their silent strength, they stirred within me a will to endure.",
            "In the dim shade of a sun-baked afternoon, you might pass it by without a second thought. Just a residential area, lurking behind a tattered shopping strip, not the sort of place one would reckon folks lay their heads. Surely not the sort of place most would choose. Yet, if your feet lead you past the derelict husk of the old Whole Foods and beyond the weary hotels standing empty but for those scattered summer gatherings, you'll stumble upon a hidden hive of life. Streets lined with apartment blocks, standing shoulder to shoulder, like Russian dolls meticulously disassembled and placed out in a solemn procession along the road. The first of these buildings, infamous from the news, speak of dealings best left unspoken. Appearances, they are deceptive things. Yet, in the shadow of these, the remaining complexes hold a world unknown to those who wander these parts. Across from them, the community college's satellite campus sits, a cluster of sleepy edifices, guarding the road. Students drift in with coffee clutched close, eyes heavy with the dawn, starting their days in a drowsy haze. The iron gates creak and groan, letting them in, one by one, as the commuters curse and gnash their teeth, the traffic swells and ebbs with the morning tide.  \n\nThe road ends at a crossroads, where a park sprawls on one side and a rehabilitation center, a haven for those with bones fractured by fate, stands on the other. Its porch hosts cheerful furniture, and the ceiling fan turns slow, stirring the thick summer air like a gentle hand through water. Children dart and dance across the park's grassy expanse, limbs flailing joyously among the bees that buzz 'round the flowers. Retirees walk dogs along the path, eyes narrowed at the skateboarders, nodding politely at the teenage girls, who whisper of boys and the latest YouTube idols. Nearby, a sushi joint sits in the strip mall’s embrace, serving modest fare to sparse crowds. A swimming supply store clings close beside, a nail salon nestled between. One could ready a pool, manicure nails, and feast on hibachi chicken all in one breath—the strange allure of the strip mall. A frozen yogurt place too, where teens from the park clutch chilled cups, adorned with toppings, as they skate and vape, chasing the ghost of cool. This neighborhood, a slice of Americana, a relic of the languid South where time drifts slow, like the smoke from a distant fire.",
            "The neighborhood's a place of quiet mystery, a tapestry of single-family homes interwoven with those split in twain yet bound together, a strange harmony that makes a kind of sense. Our house stands with its small yard in the fore and a narrow drive to the left, a relic of a time when the suburbs promised the American dream, that once-sweet embrace now turned away, leaving us to grasp what remains. Yet the neighborhood endures, calling out in its mute way that the dream lives still, clung to by those who wander its streets. The folk here, they've lost some of the shine in their eyes, their yards untended as once they weren't, but cars still grace the drives, and children run and shout, their games the whole of their world.\n\nThe old public school, nearing a century, stands firm, conjuring futures for the young and stirring memories in the old. Churches, sparse and echoing, stand mostly empty, but the basketball courts still resound with life. Each home bears its own face yet they echo one another, a chorus of sameness. Super \"A,\" the supermarket, is held by a Yemeni family, the sole Arabs in this place where most folk are African American. Wide streets stretch out, fields for children playing football, pausing only for passing cars.\n\nGenerations have walked these streets, tales of a time when all knew each other spoken in the quiet of porches. There was a karate school once, but as Hollywood's tales of the Karate Kid faded, so did the children's dreams, and now it's a pharmacy, for such are the times. A small theater shows old films, shunned by the young for lack of new spectacle, but cherished by elders, a bargain for a night away from the clamor.\n\nAn expressway cuts through, its exits lying beyond our reach, the youth having clamored for their own gateway, a notion the elders quashed, fearing it would mar what we have. Now a new high school rises, and in it, a choice for a mascot. I think of a cyborg with a country twang, a cabin of logs, a fitting emblem for this place of ours.",
            "In the sprawl of this city, the neighborhood winds through a tapestry of lives and places, each thread distinct yet woven into the whole. The city breathes with the cadence of its diversity, blocks lined with dwellings that stand amidst the scatter of businesses, each pursuing its own commerce under the vast indifferent sky. Here, in this labyrinth of streets, restaurants rise like sentinels offering their fare, while shops both grand and humble beckon all who wander by. The boutiques, with their small windows and whispered promises, nestle beside the giants of corporate commerce, their shadows stretching across pavements that lead to parks where parents watch their children at play, laughter echoing in the open air.\n\nThe people of this place are as varied as the city itself. Each face tells a story, and they gather in communities, each with its own pulse. Here, a vibrant LGBTQ+ community flourishes beside the solemnity of Orthodox Jewish life, and nearby, the echoes of the former Soviet Union linger in the voices of refugees and immigrants. Beyond these borders, the city stretches wide, where each district bears the stamp of those who call it home—Korea town, China town, Little Armenia—all within a stone's throw yet separated by the slow crawl of traffic that chokes the city's arteries.\n\nFew choose to walk the endless streets, for the city sprawls far and wide, and the vehicles claim the roads with their ceaseless noise. Construction cranes swing their long arms, raising new towers into the skyline, drawing more souls to this crowded land. The residents watch, some with hope, others with wary eyes, for the roads groan beneath the weight of so many, and the hunt for a place to rest one's car is a trial unto itself.\n\nYet within this chaos lies choice. There are houses and homes, spread across the city in their multitude of forms. Large apartments rise like cliffs, but for those who seek the quiet, there are smaller buildings, single-family homes, and duplexes that hold their ground against the encroaching tide. Here too, the people differ, each age and story a part of the city's fabric. But the bonds that once tied neighbor to neighbor have weakened, and the streets remember a time when children's laughter filled the air, when the games of youth bound them together in camaraderie beneath the watchful gaze of long-vanished summers.",
            "Where's everything? she said as we rolled through the endless cornfields, the horizon swallowed whole by the stalks. This is it, I told her, knowing the vastness would leave her stunned. She came from a place where the grocery store lay but a five-minute stroll away—never had she seen such open sky. Awash in the sameness of corn, I spoke of growing up in rural Ohio, and in that moment, she finally knew me and the soil from which I came. The road stretched on, a narrow country lane, till it met a quarry filled with water, and just beyond, the small settlement that was home. These houses, brick and stucco, each resting on their half-acre plots, land that folks here took pride in tending. Come spring, flowers burst forth, and trees of the Midwest donned their seasonal dress. Driveways lined with gleaming Mercedes, their chrome bright under the noonday sun after a careful wash.\n\nOnward we drove toward my gray stucco home, past my Korean neighbor with his ever-present smile. He spent his days on the mower, his song rising above its drone, a man whose humor had softened with age. Once a doctor, now he blended with the grass and the hum of his John Deere. The neighborhood chuckled at his antics, but he was genuine, a soul with stories to tell. At last, my home. In the side yard, geese wandered, pursued by our Terrier. Out back, a stream fed the quarry, its voice mingling with the bullfrog's call and the distant lowing of cattle.\n\nAcross the bridge I built by hand lay an untouched oasis, wild with trees and herbs and flowers never planted. Here was the ground of my childhood, building forts in the trees, chasing creatures more imagined than real. Always something to do, a neighbor child to join in play. Winters came hard in our small town, the kind that cut to the bone, but they brought a beauty all their own. The land, once green, turned stark and bare, the trees mere skeletons against the sky. Snow fell sometimes, and overnight the world transformed, a winter's dream. The backyard filled with snow angels, my sister's hand in their making, and snowmen stood sentry. We fought often as children, my sister and I, and in winter, snowballs were our chosen arms. Our forts were grand, igloos built of branches, housing our arsenal. In that frozen world, we played at life, nothing beyond our make-believe mattered. We were children, unburdened by the weight of the world."
